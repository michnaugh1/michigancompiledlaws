</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The Michigan Council for Rehabilitation Services was created by Executive Order 2012-10(V). The composition of the Council is governed by federal law, which includes the requirement that the Council include at least one representative of the state's workforce development board. 29 U.S.C § 725(b)(1)(B)(xii). In 2012, when the Michigan Council for Rehabilitation Services was formed, the Talent Investment Board served as Michigan's workforce development board. Therefore, the order establishing the Michigan Council for Rehabilitation Services required that its membership include a representative from the Talent Investment  Board. EO 2012-10(V)(B)(1)(g).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>In 2018, the workforce development board designation was transferred to the Future Talent Council when the Talent Investment Board was renamed. EO 2018-13(I)(A). An executive order was later issued specifying that the membership of the Michigan Council for Rehabilitation Services must include a representative of the Future Talent Council. EO 2019-3(6)(a)(3). In 2020, the workforce development board designation was again transferred, now to the Michigan Workforce Development Board. EO 2020-107(1)(a). When the Workforce Development Board was created, the establishing order did not update the requirements regarding the Michigan Council for Rehabilitation Services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>This order updates the membership requirements for the Michigan Council for Rehabilitation Services to include one representative of the Michigan Workforce Development Board, as required by federal law.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Acting under the Michigan Constitution of 1963 and Michigan law, I order the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>1. The Michigan Council for Rehabilitation Services must include as a member one individual representing the Workforce Development Board, as created by EO 2020-107.</div>
