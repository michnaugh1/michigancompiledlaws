Any city so providing for terms for the trial of jury cases and having a justice court clerk who acts as clerk for all of the justices of the peace in such city, may by an ordinance passed by a 3/4 vote of the legislative body of said city, adopt the provisions of this act as the method of the selection of jurors for the trial of jury cases. In such ordinance it shall not be necessary to embody the terms of this act but the same may be adopted by reference only.
