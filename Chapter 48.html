<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whichever bond is required under section 35 of this chapter shall be conditioned that the person shall faithfully and properly execute the person's duty and trust, and that the treasurer shall pay according to law all money which shall come to the treasurer's hands as treasurer, and will render a just and true account of that money at any time required by the county board of commissioners, or by law, and that the treasurer shall deliver over to the treasurer's successor in office, or to any other person authorized by law to receive the same, all money, books, papers, and other things appertaining or belonging to the office. If an individual bond for the county treasurer is required, it shall be in an amount as determined by the county board of commissioners and shall be given to the county board of commissioners with 3 or more sufficient sureties as determined by the county board of commissioners. Further, if an individual bond for the county treasurer is required and if the county board of commissioners neglects or refuses, for the period of 20 days after the commencement of the term for which the treasurer was elected, to approve of the sufficiency of the sureties to the bond, or direct the sum in which the same shall be given, the circuit judge, on application of the treasurer elect, may approve of the sufficiency of the sureties of the bond, on being satisfied of their pecuniary responsibility to meet the exigency of the bond, and may direct the sum for which the bond shall be given, not however in a less sum than that directed for the treasurer's predecessor.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 37.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The county treasurer shall appoint a deputy, who, in the absence of the treasurer from the office, or in case of a vacancy in the office, or a disability of the treasurer to perform the duties of the office, may perform all the duties of the office of treasurer, until the vacancy is filled or the disability is removed. The county treasurer may revoke those appointments at any time. The deputy shall qualify by taking the constitutional oath of office and filing a bond, if the county board of commissioners determines that an individual bond is necessary. The treasurer may employ personnel necessary and approved by the county board of commissioners. In a county having a civil service, employment of personnel shall be in accordance with Act No. 370 of the Public Acts of 1941, as amended, being sections 38.401 to 38.428 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. All appointments and revocations of appointments shall be in writing. A treasurer shall not be responsible for the acts, defaults, and misconduct in office of a deputy or any other employee in the treasurer's office accruing without the knowledge or negligence of the treasurer. Each employee, before entering upon the duties of office, shall execute and file an individual bond, for the faithful performance of duties in the amount, form, and manner prescribed by the county board of commissioners, if the county board of commissioners determines that an individual bond is necessary. The deputy or other employee shall be liable for the deputy's or employee's acts, defaults, and misconduct in office in the same manner as the treasurer or the treasurer's executors and administrators would otherwise be liable, and actions for those acts, defaults, and misconduct shall be prosecuted directly against the deputy or other employee, and the appropriate surety.</DIV>
