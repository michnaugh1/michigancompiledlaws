<B></B><table>
    <tr>
      <td>A COMPACT</td>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The contracting states solemnly agree:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) That it shall be competent for the duly constituted judicial and administrative authorities of a state party to this compact, (herein called "sending state") to permit any person convicted of an offense within such state and placed on probation or released on parole to reside in any other state party to this compact, (herein called "receiving state") while on probation or parole, if</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Such person is in fact a resident of or has his family residing within the receiving state and can obtain employment there;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Though not a resident of the receiving state and not having his family residing there, the receiving state consents to such person's being sent there.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Before granting such permission, opportunity shall be granted to the receiving state to investigate the home and prospective employment of such person.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>A resident of the receiving state, within the meaning of this section, is one who has been an actual inhabitant of such state continuously for more than 1 year prior to his coming to the sending state and has not resided within the sending state for more than 6 continuous months immediately preceding the commission of the offense for which he has been convicted. </div>

For that purpose no formalities will be required other than establishing the authority of the officer and the identity of the person to be retaken. All legal requirements to obtain extradition or fugitives from justice are hereby expressly waived. The decision of the sending state to retake a person on probation or parole shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state: Provided, however, That if at the time when a state seeks to retake a probationer or parolee there should be pending against him within the receiving state any criminal charge, or he should be suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, he shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) That the duly accredited officers of the sending state will be permitted to transport prisoners being retaken through any and all states parties to this compact, without interference. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) That the governor of each state may designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other contracting states, if and when appointed, shall promulgate such rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary to more effectively carry out the terms of this compact.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) That this compact shall become operative immediately upon its ratification by any state as between it and any other state or states so ratifying. When ratified, it shall have the full force and effect of law within such state; the form of ratification to be in accordance with the laws of the ratifying state. </div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The governor of the state of Michigan is further authorized and empowered to enter into any other agreements or compacts with any of the United States not inconsistent with the laws of this state or of the United States, or the other agreeing states, for cooperative effort and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime and in the enforcement of the penal laws and policies of the contracting states and to establish agencies, joint or otherwise, as may be deemed desirable for making effective such agreements and compacts. The intent and purpose of this act is to grant to the governor of the state of Michigan administrative power and authority if and when conditions of crime make it necessary to bind the state in a cooperative effort to reduce crime and to make the enforcement of the criminal laws of agreeing states more effective, all pursuant to the consent of the Congress of the United States heretofore granted.</DIV>
