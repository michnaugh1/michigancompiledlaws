<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Before a county obtains its grant from the amount annually appropriated for secondary road patrol and traffic accident prevention to implement section 76, the county shall enter into an agreement for the secondary road patrol and traffic accident prevention services with the office of highway safety planning. A county applying for a grant for secondary road patrol and traffic accident prevention shall provide information about the services to be provided under section 76 by the sheriff's department of the county.

By April 1 of each year following a year for which the county received an allocation, a county that receives a grant for secondary road patrol and traffic accident prevention shall submit a report to the office of highway safety planning on a form provided by the office of highway safety planning. The report must contain the information described in subsection (6). An agreement entered pursuant to this section is void if the county reduces its expenditures or level of road patrol below that which the county was expending or providing immediately before October 1, 1978, or October 1, 2021, whichever year the expenditures or level of road patrol is less, unless the county is required to reduce general services because of economic conditions and is not merely reducing law enforcement services.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) For the fiscal years beginning October 1, 1980, and October 1, 1981, a county's share of the amount annually appropriated for secondary road patrol and traffic accident prevention must be the same percentage that the county received, or was eligible to receive, of the total amount allocated to all counties under section 12 of 1951 PA 51, MCL 247.662, less the amounts distributed for snow removal and engineers, during the period of July 1, 1976, through June 30, 1977. County primary roads and county local roads within the boundaries of a city or village must not be used in determining the percentage under this section unless the sheriff's department of the county is providing the services described in section 76(2) and (3) within the city or village pursuant to an agreement between the county and the city or village adopted after October 1, 1978. The agreement must not be reimbursable under the formula described in this subsection unless the city or village is required to reduce general services because of economic conditions and is not merely reducing law enforcement services.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The civil service commission shall require an individual applying for admission to an examination provided for under this act or under the rules of the commission to file in its office, within a reasonable time prior to the proposed examination, a formal application in which the applicant shall state under oath or affirmation all of the following:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Lacks any of the established preliminary requirements for the examination or position of employment for which the applicant applied. </DIV>

The commission shall certify that an applicant is free from any bodily or mental defects, deformity, or diseases that might incapacitate the applicant from the performance of the duties of the position desired. Applications will not be accepted if the person applying is less than 18 years of age and has not been a resident of this state for at least 1 year prior to the application for any position in the department. If any applicant has formerly served in the department of the county to which the application is made for a period of more than 10 years, has resigned from the department at a time when there were no charges of misconduct or other misfeasance pending against the applicant within a period of 2 years next preceding the date of his or her application, and is a resident of that county, then that applicant is eligible for reinstatement at the discretion of the civil service commission. The applicant, providing his or her former term of service so justifies, may be reappointed to the department without examination other than a physical examination. If an applicant is reinstated to the department, the applicant shall be the lowest in rank in the department next above the probationers of the department. This subsection does not require new or additional third party reimbursement or worker's compensation benefits for services rendered.</DIV>

The appeal shall be taken within 90 days from the entry by the civil service commission of its final order. Upon such an appeal being taken and docketed with the clerk of the circuit court, the circuit court shall proceed to hear the appeal upon the original record taken therein and no additional proof shall be permitted to be introduced. The circuit court's decision shall be final, saving to the employee, however, the right to petition the supreme court for a review of the court's decision. The removing officer and the person sought to be removed at all times, both before the civil service commission and upon appeal, may employ counsel to represent either of them before the civil service commission and upon appeal.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If for any reason of economy it shall be deemed necessary by any county to reduce the number of paid members of any department, then the county shall follow the following procedure:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The removals shall be accomplished by suspending in numerical order, commencing with the last man appointed to the department, all recent appointees to the department until such reductions shall have been accomplished. If the department again is increased in number to the strength existing prior to the reduction of members, the members suspended last under the terms of this act shall be first reinstated before any new appointments to the department shall be made.</DIV>
