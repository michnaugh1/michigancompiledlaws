June 21, 2016 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> The Michigan School Reform Act does not violate federal and state constitutional protections, Moore v Detroit School Reform Board, 293 F3d 352 (CA 6 2002).<BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> Senate Bill 393 (SB 393) was enrolled on August 13, 2003, and presented to the governor for her approval on September 8, 2003, at 5:00 p.m. On September 18, 2003, the senate requested that the bill be returned to the senate. The governor granted the senate's request on that same date and returned the bill to that body (without objections), where a motion was made to vacate the enrollment and the motion prevailed. On September 23, 2003, the house of representatives approved a motion to send a letter to the senate agreeing with the senate's request that the governor return SB 393. Neither the Senate Journal nor the House Journal entries reveal any other action taken by the house of representatives regarding the return of SB 393.In order to determine whether SB 393 had become law, as requested, the attorney general examined whether SB 393 was recalled by concurrent action of the house of representatives and the senate within the 14-day period afforded the governor for vetoing a bill under the last sentence of Const 1963, art IV, § 33: “SB 393 was presented to the Governor on September 8, 2003, at 5:00 p.m. The 14-day period afforded for consideration, measured in hours and minutes, therefore expired on September 22, 2003 at 5:00 p.m. While the Senate had acted to recall the bill within that 14-day period (on September 18, 2003), the House did not. Its action concurring in the request to recall SB 393 was not taken until September 23, 2003. In the absence of concurrent action by both houses of the Legislature within the 14-day period, SB 393 was not effectively recalled and 'further legislative action thereon' was not authorized.” The attorney general declared that “in the absence of a return of the bill with objections, SB 393 therefore became law by operation of the last sentence of Const 1963, art IV, § 33.” OAG, 2003, No. 7139 (October 2, 2003).<BR><B>Popular Name:</B> Act 451</p>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) There are not enough persons residing in the school district and qualified under law to hold all of the offices of the school district or who will accept the offices of the school district. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) After consultation with the intermediate school district in which the district is located, the superintendent of public instruction and state treasurer jointly determine that all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The school district was required to submit a deficit elimination plan under the state school aid act of 1979 and the school district either has failed to submit a plan or lacks the capability to both implement a deficit elimination plan and meet the school district's obligations to provide public educational services to pupils and other residents of the school district in a manner that complies with this act, the state school aid act of 1979, and rules promulgated by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The school district is not financially viable and is unable to educate pupils in grades K-12 residing in the school district by operating schools for a full school year and providing the required number of instructional hours under this act and the state school aid act of 1979.

For purposes of this subsection, the intermediate school board and other officers of the intermediate school district in which the geographic area of the dissolved school district is located shall perform the functions and responsibilities of the board and other officers of the dissolved school district relating to levying the sinking fund tax and shall distribute the proceeds of the levy to each receiving school district that operates a school building previously operated by the dissolved school district.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) To the extent permitted under federal law and any applicable waiver approved by the United States department of education, the department shall not include the test scores of pupils from the dissolved school district for determining adequate yearly progress status or for "top-to-bottom" rankings of the receiving school districts for the first 3 school years after dissolution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) For the same number of school years for which test scores of pupils from the dissolved district are not used under subsection (7), a receiving school district shall not use the test scores of pupils from the dissolved school district as a factor in any performance evaluation of an employee of the receiving school district. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The pupils formerly enrolled in the dissolved school district have all the legal and constitutional rights and privileges of the other pupils enrolled in the receiving school districts.</div>

Eff. Jan. 14, 1994.Senate Bill 393 (SB 393) was enrolled on August 13, 2003, and presented to the governor for her approval on September 8, 2003, at 5:00 p.m. On September 18, 2003, the senate requested that the bill be returned to the senate. The governor granted the senate's request on that same date and returned the bill to that body (without objections), where a motion was made to vacate the enrollment and the motion prevailed. On September 23, 2003, the house of representatives approved a motion to send a letter to the senate agreeing with the senate's request that the governor return SB 393. Neither the Senate Journal nor the House Journal entries reveal any other action taken by the house of representatives regarding the return of SB 393.In order to determine whether SB 393 had become law, as requested, the attorney general examined whether SB 393 was recalled by concurrent action of the house of representatives and the senate within the 14-day period afforded the governor for vetoing a bill under the last sentence of Const 1963, art 4, § 33: “SB 393 was presented to the Governor on September 8, 2003, at 5:00 p.m. The 14-day period afforded for consideration, measured in hours and minutes, therefore expired on September 22, 2003 at 5:00 p.m. While the Senate had acted to recall the bill within that 14-day period (on September 18, 2003), the House did not. Its action concurring in the request to recall SB 393 was not taken until September 23, 2003. In the absence of concurrent action by both houses of the Legislature within the 14-day period, SB 393 was not effectively recalled and 'further legislative action thereon' was not authorized.” The attorney general declared that “in the absence of a return of the bill with objections, SB 393 therefore became law by operation of the last sentence of art 4, § 33.” OAG, 2003, No. 7139 (October 2, 2003).<BR><B>Popular Name:</B> Act 451<BR><B>Popular Name:</B> Charter Schools<BR><B>Popular Name:</B> Public School Academies</p>

Oct. 3, 2003 <BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> Senate Bill 393 (SB 393) was enrolled on August 13, 2003, and presented to the governor for her approval on September 8, 2003, at 5:00 p.m. On September 18, 2003, the senate requested that the bill be returned to the senate. The governor granted the senate's request on that same date and returned the bill to that body (without objections), where a motion was made to vacate the enrollment and the motion prevailed. On September 23, 2003, the house of representatives approved a motion to send a letter to the senate agreeing with the senate's request that the governor return SB 393. Neither the Senate Journal nor the House Journal entries reveal any other action taken by the house of representatives regarding the return of SB 393.In order to determine whether SB 393 had become law, as requested, the attorney general examined whether SB 393 was recalled by concurrent action of the house of representatives and the senate within the 14-day period afforded the governor for vetoing a bill under the last sentence of Const 1963, art 4, § 33: “SB 393 was presented to the Governor on September 8, 2003, at 5:00 p.m. The 14-day period afforded for consideration, measured in hours and minutes, therefore expired on September 22, 2003 at 5:00 p.m. While the Senate had acted to recall the bill within that 14-day period (on September 18, 2003), the House did not. Its action concurring in the request to recall SB 393 was not taken until September 23, 2003. In the absence of concurrent action by both houses of the Legislature within the 14-day period, SB 393 was not effectively recalled and 'further legislative action thereon' was not authorized.” The attorney general declared that “in the absence of a return of the bill with objections, SB 393 therefore became law by operation of the last sentence of art 4, § 33.” OAG, 2003, No. 7139 (October 2, 2003).<BR><B>Popular Name:</B> Act 451<BR><B>Popular Name:</B> Charter Schools<BR><B>Popular Name:</B> Public School Academies</p>

Jan. 14, 1994.Senate Bill 393 (SB 393) was enrolled on August 13, 2003, and presented to the governor for her approval on September 8, 2003, at 5:00 p.m. On September 18, 2003, the senate requested that the bill be returned to the senate. The governor granted the senate's request on that same date and returned the bill to that body (without objections), where a motion was made to vacate the enrollment and the motion prevailed. On September 23, 2003, the house of representatives approved a motion to send a letter to the senate agreeing with the senate's request that the governor return SB 393. Neither the Senate Journal nor the House Journal entries reveal any other action taken by the house of representatives regarding the return of SB 393.In order to determine whether SB 393 had become law, as requested, the attorney general examined whether SB 393 was recalled by concurrent action of the house of representatives and the senate within the 14-day period afforded the governor for vetoing a bill under the last sentence of Const 1963, art 4, § 33: “SB 393 was presented to the Governor on September 8, 2003, at 5:00 p.m. The 14-day period afforded for consideration, measured in hours and minutes, therefore expired on September 22, 2003 at 5:00 p.m. While the Senate had acted to recall the bill within that 14-day period (on September 18, 2003), the House did not. Its action concurring in the request to recall SB 393 was not taken until September 23, 2003. In the absence of concurrent action by both houses of the Legislature within the 14-day period, SB 393 was not effectively recalled and 'further legislative action thereon' was not authorized.” The attorney general declared that “in the absence of a return of the bill with objections, SB 393 therefore became law by operation of the last sentence of art 4, § 33.” OAG, 2003, No. 7139 (October 2, 2003).<BR><B>Popular Name:</B> Act 451<BR><B>Popular Name:</B> Charter Schools<BR><B>Popular Name:</B> Public School Academies</p>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Oversee each public school academy operating under a contract issued by the authorizing body. The oversight must be sufficient to ensure that the board of directors is in compliance with the terms of the contract and with applicable law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Develop and implement a process for holding a public school academy accountable for meeting applicable academic performance standards set forth in the contract and for implementing corrective action for a public school academy that does not meet those standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Take necessary measures to ensure that the board of directors of a public school academy operates independently of any educational management company involved in the operations of the public school academy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Oversee and ensure that the pupil admission process used by the public school academy is operated in a fair and open manner and is in compliance with the contract and this part.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Ensure that the board of directors of the public school academy maintains and releases information as necessary to comply with applicable law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An authorizing body may enter into an agreement with 1 or more other authorizing bodies to carry out any function of an authorizing body under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The authorizing body for a public school academy is the fiscal agent for the public school academy. A state school aid payment for a public school academy must be paid to the authorizing body that is the fiscal agent for that public school academy, and the authorizing body shall then forward the payment to the public school academy. Within 30 days after a contract is submitted to the department by an authorizing body under subsection (1), the department shall issue a district code to the public school academy for which the contract was issued. If the department does not issue a district code within 30 days after a contract is filed, the state treasurer shall assign a temporary district code in order for the public school academy to receive funding under the state school aid act of 1979.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A contract issued under this part may be revoked by the authorizing body if the authorizing body determines that 1 or more of the following have occurred:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except for a public school academy that is an alternative school serving a special student population, if the department determines that a public school academy site that has been operating for at least 4 years is among the lowest achieving 5% of public schools in this state for the immediately preceding 3 school years, as determined under federal accountability requirements as provided under the every student succeeds act, Public Law 114-95, not to include any individualized education plan subgroup, the department shall notify the public school academy's authorizing body. Subject to subsection (6), if an authorizing body receives notice from the department under this subsection, the authorizing body shall notify the public school academy and amend the public school academy's contract to eliminate the public school academy's authority to operate the existing age and grade levels at the site and the public school academy shall cease operating the existing age and grade levels at the site, effective at the end of the current school year. Subject to subsection (6), if the public school academy operates at only 1 site, and the authorizing body receives notice from the department under this subsection, the authorizing body shall notify the public school academy and revoke the public school academy's contract, effective at the end of the current school year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For a public school academy or site that is subject to a notice to its authorizing body under subsection (5), the department shall consider other public school options available to pupils in the grade levels offered by the public school academy or site who reside in the geographic area served by the public school academy or site. If the department determines that closure of the public school academy or site would result in an unreasonable hardship to these pupils because there are insufficient other public school options reasonably available for these pupils, the department may rescind the notice. If the department rescinds a notice subjecting a public school academy or site to closure, the department shall do so before the end of the school year. If the department rescinds a notice subjecting a public school academy or site to closure, the department shall require the public school academy or site to implement a school improvement plan that includes measures to increase pupil growth and improve pupil proficiency, with growth and proficiency measured by performance on state assessments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Except as otherwise provided in section 502 or 503, the decision of an authorizing body to issue, not issue, or reconstitute a contract under this part, or to terminate or revoke a contract under this section, is solely within the discretion of the authorizing body, is final, and is not subject to review by a court or any state agency. An authorizing body that issues, does not issue, or reconstitutes a contract under this part, or that terminates or revokes a contract under this section, is not liable for that action to the public school academy, the public school academy corporation, a pupil of the public school academy, the parent or guardian of a pupil of the public school academy, or any other person.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Except as otherwise provided in this section, before an authorizing body revokes a contract, the authorizing body may consider and take corrective measures to avoid revocation. An authorizing body may reconstitute the public school academy in a final attempt to improve student educational performance or to avoid interruption of the educational process. An authorizing body shall include a reconstituting provision in the contract that identifies these corrective measures, including, but not limited to, canceling a contract with an educational management organization, if any, withdrawing approval of a contract under section 506, or appointing a new board of directors or a trustee to take over operation of the public school academy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If an authorizing body revokes a contract, the authorizing body shall work with a school district or another public school, or with a combination of these entities, to ensure a smooth transition for the affected pupils. If the revocation occurs during the school year, the authorizing body, as the fiscal agent for the public school academy under this part, shall return any school aid funds held by the authorizing body that are attributable to the affected pupils to the state treasurer for deposit into the state school aid fund. The state treasurer shall distribute funds to the public school in which the pupils enroll after the revocation pursuant to a methodology established by the department and the center for educational performance and information created under section 94a of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1694a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Not more than 10 days after a public school academy's contract terminates or is revoked, the authorizing body shall notify the superintendent of public instruction in writing of the name of the public school academy whose contract has terminated or been revoked and the date of contract termination or revocation.</div>

Feb. 13, 2024 <BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> Senate Bill 393 (SB 393) was enrolled on August 13, 2003, and presented to the governor for her approval on September 8, 2003, at 5:00 p.m. On September 18, 2003, the senate requested that the bill be returned to the senate. The governor granted the senate's request on that same date and returned the bill to that body (without objections), where a motion was made to vacate the enrollment and the motion prevailed. On September 23, 2003, the house of representatives approved a motion to send a letter to the senate agreeing with the senate's request that the governor return SB 393. Neither the Senate Journal nor the House Journal entries reveal any other action taken by the house of representatives regarding the return of SB 393.In order to determine whether SB 393 had become law, as requested, the attorney general examined whether SB 393 was recalled by concurrent action of the house of representatives and the senate within the 14-day period afforded the governor for vetoing a bill under the last sentence of Const 1963, art 4, § 33: “SB 393 was presented to the Governor on September 8, 2003, at 5:00 p.m. The 14-day period afforded for consideration, measured in hours and minutes, therefore expired on September 22, 2003 at 5:00 p.m. While the Senate had acted to recall the bill within that 14-day period (on September 18, 2003), the House did not. Its action concurring in the request to recall SB 393 was not taken until September 23, 2003. In the absence of concurrent action by both houses of the Legislature within the 14-day period, SB 393 was not effectively recalled and 'further legislative action thereon' was not authorized.” The attorney general declared that “in the absence of a return of the bill with objections, SB 393 therefore became law by operation of the last sentence of art 4, § 33.” OAG, 2003, No. 7139 (October 2, 2003).For transfer of state school reform/redesign school district and state school reform/redesign officer from department of education to state school reform office created as an autonomous entity within department of technology, management, and budget, see E.R.O.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The authorizing body for an urban high school academy is the fiscal agent for the urban high school academy. A state school aid payment for an urban high school academy must be paid to the authorizing body that is the fiscal agent for that urban high school academy that must then forward the payment to the urban high school academy. Within 30 days after a contract is submitted to the department by an authorizing body under subsection (1), the department shall issue a district code to the urban high school academy for which the contract was issued.

If the department rescinds a notice subjecting an urban high school academy or site to closure, the department shall require the urban high school academy or site to implement a school improvement plan that includes measures to increase pupil growth and improve pupil proficiency, with growth and proficiency measured by performance on state assessments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Except as otherwise provided in section 522, the decision of an authorizing body to issue, not issue, or reconstitute a contract under this part, or to terminate or revoke a contract under this section, is solely within the discretion of the authorizing body, is final, and is not subject to review by a court or any state agency.

The state treasurer shall distribute funds to the public school in which the pupils enroll after the revocation pursuant to a methodology established by the department and the center for educational performance and information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Not more than 10 days after an urban high school academy's contract terminates or is revoked, the authorizing body shall notify the superintendent of public instruction in writing of the name of the urban high school academy whose contract has terminated or been revoked and the date of contract termination or revocation.</div>

Following receipt, the state treasurer, or the state treasurer's designee, shall deposit this remaining money in the state school aid fund.</div>

Neither the Senate Journal nor the House Journal entries reveal any other action taken by the house of representatives regarding the return of SB 393.In order to determine whether SB 393 had become law, as requested, the attorney general examined whether SB 393 was recalled by concurrent action of the house of representatives and the senate within the 14-day period afforded the governor for vetoing a bill under the last sentence of Const 1963, art 4, § 33: “SB 393 was presented to the Governor on September 8, 2003, at 5:00 p.m. The 14-day period afforded for consideration, measured in hours and minutes, therefore expired on September 22, 2003 at 5:00 p.m. While the Senate had acted to recall the bill within that 14-day period (on September 18, 2003), the House did not. Its action concurring in the request to recall SB 393 was not taken until September 23, 2003. In the absence of concurrent action by both houses of the Legislature within the 14-day period, SB 393 was not effectively recalled and 'further legislative action thereon' was not authorized.” The attorney general declared that “in the absence of a return of the bill with objections, SB 393 therefore became law by operation of the last sentence of art 4, § 33.” OAG, 2003, No. 7139 (October 2, 2003).For transfer of certain powers and duties of department of education and superintendent of public instruction under MCL 380.1280c and 423.215 to state school reform/redesign office, see E.R.O.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For a school of excellence or site that is subject to a notice to its authorizing body under subsection (5), the department shall consider other public school options available to pupils in the grade levels offered by the school of excellence or site who reside in the geographic area served by the school of excellence or site.

If the department rescinds a notice subjecting a school of excellence or site to closure, the department shall do so before the end of the school year. If the department rescinds a notice subjecting a school of excellence or site to closure, the department shall require the school of excellence or site to implement a school improvement plan that includes measures to increase pupil growth and improve pupil proficiency, with growth and proficiency measured by performance on state assessments.</div>

The state treasurer shall distribute funds to the public school in which the pupils enroll after the revocation pursuant to a methodology established by the department and the center for educational performance and information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Not more than 10 days after a school of excellence's contract terminates or is revoked, the authorizing body shall notify the superintendent of public instruction in writing of the name of the school of excellence whose contract has terminated or been revoked and the date of contract termination or revocation.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Simultaneously with the filing of the certificate of dissolution under subdivision (b), the school of excellence board of directors shall provide a copy of the board of directors' plan of distribution of assets to the state treasurer for approval. Within 30 days, the state treasurer, or the state treasurer's designee, shall review and approve the board of directors' plan of distribution of assets.

The adjustment shall apply only to expenditures or violations occurring after the date of the adjusting of the amount.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A school district of not less than 18,000 pupils, a first class school district, or a school district offering or making available to its pupils a comprehensive vocational education program approved by the state board, may elect not to come under an area vocational-technical education program by resolution adopted by its board not later than 30 days after receipt of notice that the question of establishing the area vocational-technical education program will be submitted to the school electors of the district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A school district electing not to come under the area vocational-technical education program may thereafter elect to come under the program if at a special or regular school election a majority of the school electors voting approve the operation of the area vocational-technical education program and the annual tax rate for that purpose in effect in the other constituent districts of the intermediate school district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as provided in this subsection, in an intermediate school district where the school electors have voted upon and failed to approve the ballot question set forth in section 681, a combination of 2 or more contiguous constituent districts, by resolution of their boards, may elect to establish an area vocational-technical education program, if approved by resolution of the intermediate district board and designated by the state board. The requirement of contiguity of constituent districts does not apply if 1 or more of the districts that constitute the basis of contiguity declare their intent, by board resolution, not to be part of the proposed area vocational-technical education program. At any time within 6 months after the enactment of the resolution establishing the program in a local school district, school electors equal in number to not less than 5% of the votes cast in the most recent school election may petition their local school district board to submit the resolution to the school district filing official for submission to the electorate, in a form and manner to be prescribed by the secretary of state, and the district's participation in the program shall be terminated if not approved by a majority of the school electors voting on the question.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Area vocational-technical education programs established under this section shall receive appropriate state funding or federal funding allocated by the state board on exactly the same basis as area vocational-technical education programs and centers established by intermediate school districts. Constituent districts establishing an approved area vocational-technical education program under this section may designate, by board resolution, specific amounts of either authorized operating millage or operating millage being requested from the school electors to be utilized solely for the area vocational-technical education program, in a manner to be prescribed by the state board, and the specified amount of millage shall be regarded as area vocational-technical education millage rather than local school district operating millage in all computations made by the state board to determine state aid. The revenue obtained from the millage designated, together with appropriate state and federal funds, may be expended for the same purposes specified for intermediate district programs in sections 684 and 685, including contracts with the intermediate school district, another local school district, or a community college for area vocational-technical education programs, facilities, and services. If constituent districts establish area vocational-technical education programs under this section, buildings, sites, and equipment may be jointly acquired, owned, or leased.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A contiguous school district desiring to become part of an area vocational-technical education program established under this section may do so with the approval of each participating school district, the intermediate school district, and the state board. Constituent districts operating an approved area vocational-technical education program under this section may subsequently elect not to participate, or may thereafter elect to participate, in an intermediate school district vocational-technical education program in exactly the same manner prescribed in this section for school districts of not less than 18,000 pupils, a first class school district, or a school district offering or making available to its pupils a comprehensive vocational education program approved by the state board.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Beginning in 1997, and in each year after 1997, a regional enhancement property tax may be levied by an intermediate school district at a rate not to exceed 3 mills to enhance other state and local funding for intermediate school district, school district, or public school academy operations, as provided in this section, if approved by a majority of the intermediate school electors voting on the question.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a resolution requesting that the question of a regional enhancement property tax be submitted to the voters is adopted within a 180-day period and transmitted to the intermediate school board by 1 or more boards or boards of directors of its constituent districts representing a majority of the combined membership of the constituent districts as of the most recent pupil membership count day and if those resolutions all contain an identical specified number of mills to be levied under this section and an identical specified number of years for which the tax shall be levied, the question of levying a regional enhancement property tax by the intermediate school district shall be placed on the ballot by the intermediate school district at the next regular school election held in each of the constituent districts that are school districts. If the question is to be submitted to the intermediate school electors of an intermediate school district having a population of more than 1,400,000, the intermediate school board shall call a special election to be held at the next state primary or general election. If the resolution requirement is met more than 180 days before the next regular school district elections, and if requested in the resolutions, the intermediate school board shall submit the question of levying a regional enhancement property tax within the intermediate school district on the ballot at a special election called by the intermediate school board for that purpose not earlier than 90 days after the resolution requirements are met.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Not later than 10 days after receipt by the intermediate school district of the revenue from the regional enhancement property tax, the intermediate school district shall calculate and pay to each of its constituent districts an amount of the revenue calculated by dividing the total amount of the revenue by the combined membership of the constituent districts within the intermediate school district, as of the most recent pupil membership count day, and multiplying that quotient by the constituent district's membership, as of the most recent pupil membership count day for which a final department-audited pupil count is available. If a constituent district has entered into an agreement with a school district or public entity to perform the functions and responsibilities of the constituent district for operating a public school of the constituent district, then for the purposes of this subsection the pupils in membership in that public school shall be considered to be in membership in the constituent district and a proportionate share of the revenue payable to the constituent district under this section shall be transferred by the constituent district to the school district or public entity performing the functions and responsibilities of the constituent district for operating the public school. The proportionate share of that revenue to be paid to that school district or public entity shall be determined according to the percentage of the constituent district's membership that is enrolled in the particular public school for the state fiscal year corresponding to the tax year. Revenue from a regional enhancement property tax under this section shall not be allocated or paid to a constituent district that does not operate a public school directly but retains a limited separate identity for purposes of section 12, 12b, 863, 903, or 947.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a public school academy is receiving revenue from a regional enhancement property tax under an agreement described in subsection (3), the public school academy shall receive that revenue until the term of the initially levied regional enhancement property tax expires, as specified in the ballot question, as long as the receipt of that revenue remains consistent with the agreement. After the term of the initially levied regional enhancement property tax expires or the public school academy is no longer entitled to receive revenue from the regional enhancement property tax under the agreement described in subsection (3), the public school academy shall not receive revenue from any regional enhancement property tax that is subsequently levied or renewed unless that public school academy meets the requirements of subsection (7) to receive revenue from a regional enhancement property tax as a constituent district. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Regional enhancement property tax under this section may be levied for a term not to exceed 20 years, as specified in the ballot question, and may be renewed for the same term and for the purposes described in subsection (1) with the approval of a majority of the intermediate school electors voting on the question.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The question of levying a regional enhancement property tax under this section shall be presented to the intermediate school electors as a separate question.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For the purposes of this section, except as otherwise provided in this section, a public school academy is considered to be a single constituent district of an intermediate school district if the public school academy operates at least 1 site that is located in that intermediate school district and the public school academy counts in membership pupils enrolled at the site or sites located in that intermediate school district on the pupil membership count day used to calculate the combined membership of the intermediate school district's constituent districts under subsection (2). A public school academy that is a school of excellence operating as a cyber school, as defined in section 551, is considered to be a single constituent district of an intermediate school district only if the administrative office of that cyber school is located within the intermediate school district, 100% of the pupils enrolled in the cyber school reside within the intermediate school district, and the cyber school counts in membership pupils enrolled in the cyber school on the pupil membership count day used to calculate the combined membership of the intermediate school district's constituent districts under subsection (2). However, a public school academy is not eligible to be considered a constituent district under this subsection if the public school academy's 2 most recent annual financial audits required under section 503(6)(g), 523(2)(g), 553(5)(g), or 1311e(5)(h) indicate successive unresolved material findings. In addition, in order to be considered a constituent district under this subsection, the public school academy must provide the department documentation establishing that the public school academy has a special education program that is in compliance with state and federal law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Except for a school of excellence operating as a cyber school, as defined in section 551, a public school academy that receives revenue from a regional enhancement property tax due to the operation of subsection (7) shall use that money only for expenditures that directly benefit a site operated by the public school academy that is located in the intermediate school district in which the regional enhancement property tax was approved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) For a regional enhancement property tax that was initially authorized and levied before the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection, both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Subject to subsection (4), a public school academy is not eligible to be considered a constituent district and to receive revenue from that regional enhancement property tax due to the operation of subsection (7) until that regional enhancement property tax is renewed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An intermediate school district is not eligible to be considered a constituent district and to receive revenue for pupils counted in membership by the intermediate school district from that regional enhancement property tax due to the operation of subsection (10) until that regional enhancement property tax is renewed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) For a regional enhancement property tax that is initially authorized and levied or renewed after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection, for the purposes of this section, an intermediate school district is considered to be a single constituent district of the intermediate school district if it enrolls pupils who are counted in membership by the intermediate school district and not counted in membership by another intermediate school district, school district, or public school academy.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section and section 1211c, the board of a school district shall levy not more than 18 mills for school operating purposes or the number of mills levied in 1993 for school operating purposes, whichever is less. A principal residence, qualified agricultural property, qualified forest property, supportive housing property, property occupied by a public school academy, and industrial personal property are exempt from the mills levied under this subsection except for the number of mills by which that exemption is reduced under this subsection. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (9), the board of a school district that had a foundation allowance for the 1994-95 state fiscal year greater than $6,500.00 may reduce the number of mills from which a principal residence, qualified agricultural property, qualified forest property, supportive housing property, property occupied by a public school academy, and industrial personal property are exempted under this subsection by up to the number of mills, as certified under section 1211a, required to be levied on a principal residence, qualified agricultural property, qualified forest property, supportive housing property, property occupied by a public school academy, and industrial personal property for the school district's combined state and local revenue per membership pupil for the school fiscal year ending in 1995 to be equal to the school district's foundation allowance for the state fiscal year ending in 1995, and the board also may levy in 1994 or a succeeding year that number of mills for school operating purposes on a principal residence, qualified agricultural property, qualified forest property, supportive housing property, property occupied by a public school academy, and industrial personal property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to subsection (3), if the department of treasury determines that the maximum number of mills allowed to be levied under subsection (1) on all classes of property was not sufficient for a school district's combined state and local revenue per membership pupil for the school fiscal year ending in 1995 to be equal to the school district's foundation allowance for that school fiscal year, the board of the school district may levy in 1994 or a succeeding year additional mills uniformly on all property up to the number of mills required for the school district's combined state and local revenue per membership pupil for the school fiscal year ending in 1995 to be equal to the school district's foundation allowance for the state fiscal year ending in 1995. However, the board of a school district described in this subsection, by board resolution, may elect to exempt each principal residence and all qualified agricultural property, qualified forest property, supportive housing property, property occupied by a public school academy, and industrial personal property located in the school district from some or all of the mills that the board is authorized to levy under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) After 1994, the number of mills a school district may levy under this section on any class of property must not exceed the lesser of the number of mills the school district was certified by the department of treasury under section 1211a to levy on that class of property under this section in 1994 or the number of mills required to be levied on that class of property under this section to ensure that the increase from the immediately preceding state fiscal year in the school district's combined state and local revenue per membership pupil, calculated as if the school district had levied the maximum number of mills the school district was allowed to levy under this section regardless of the number of mills the school district actually levied, does not exceed the lesser of the dollar amount of the increase in the target foundation allowance under section 20 of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1620, from the immediately preceding state fiscal year or the percentage increase in the general price level in the immediately preceding calendar year. If the number of mills a school district is allowed to levy under this section in a year after 1994 is less than the number of mills the school district was allowed to levy under this section in the immediately preceding year, any reduction required by this subsection in the school district's millage rate must be calculated by first reducing the number of mills the school district is allowed to levy under subsection (2) and then increasing the number of mills from which a principal residence, qualified agricultural property, qualified forest property, supportive housing property, property occupied by a public school academy, and industrial personal property are exempted under subsection (1). For calculations under this subsection, the target foundation allowance under section 20 of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1620, for the 2018-2019 state fiscal year is considered to be the basic foundation allowance under section 20 of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1620, for the 2018-2019 state fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Commercial personal property is exempt from 12 of the mills levied under this section. However, if the number of mills from which industrial personal property is exempted for a specific school district is reduced under this section, then the number of mills from which commercial personal property is exempted for that school district must be reduced by that same number of mills.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, millage levied under this section must be approved by the school electors. For the purposes of this section, millage approved by the school electors before January 1, 1994 for which the authorization has not expired is considered to be approved by the school electors. With the approval of the state treasurer, a school district may pledge millage levied under this section for the repayment of a loan under the emergency municipal loan act, 1980 PA 243, MCL 141.931 to 141.942, money borrowed by the school district under section 1225, or the repayment of advances, overpayments, or other obligations of the school district to this state under section 15 of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1615.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a school district levies millage for school operating purposes that is in excess of the limits of this section, the amount of the resulting excess tax revenue must be deducted from the school district's next regular tax levy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a school district levies millage for school operating purposes that is less than the limits of this section, the board of the school district may levy at the school district's next regular tax levy an additional number of mills not to exceed the additional millage needed to make up the shortfall.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A school district shall not levy mills allocated under the property tax limitation act, 1933 PA 62, MCL 211.201 to 211.217a, other than mills allocated to a school district that was previously a school district of the first class, for payment to a public library commission under section 11(4) of the property tax limitation act, 1933 PA 62, MCL 211.211, after 1993.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Beginning with taxes levied for 2011, if a school district had a foundation allowance for the 1994-95 state fiscal year greater than $6,500.00 and if the school district's foundation allowance for the 2009-2010 state fiscal year was less than the basic foundation allowance prescribed for the 2009-2010 state fiscal year under section 20 of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1620, the school district may not reduce the number of mills from which certain classes of property are exempted from the levy of millage under subsection (1) and may not levy that number of mills on those classes of property as would otherwise be allowed under subsection (1).</div>

A public school academy shall transmit a copy of each report under this section to the authorizing body of the public school academy.

If the deficit for a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy that is subject to a deficit elimination plan has not been completely eliminated within 5 years after it submitted its initial deficit elimination plan, the state treasurer shall require the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy to submit an enhanced deficit elimination plan under this subsection.

If a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy is required to submit an enhanced deficit elimination plan under subsection (5), some or all of the money payable to the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy under the state school aid act of 1979 may be withheld by the state treasurer and released as provided under section 102(3) of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1702. When approving an enhanced deficit elimination plan, the state treasurer may establish the period of time within which a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy must eliminate its deficit and may set special conditions that the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy must meet while the enhanced deficit elimination plan is in effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) To assure greater coordination and effective partnerships in the development and implementation of an enhanced deficit elimination plan under subsection (5), when administering subsections (5), (6), and (9), the department of treasury shall consult with all of the following:</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The school board may include in the "capital projects fund" an amount not exceeding in 1 year .01% of the school district's taxable value to establish and maintain a school district insurance reserve fund from which school buildings or other school property damaged or destroyed by fire, lightning, or otherwise may be repaired, rebuilt, or replaced by other buildings or property to be used in its place. Taxes shall not be levied for this purpose while the insurance reserve fund exceeds or equals .1% of the school district's taxable value. The board shall carry the insurance reserves forward as an encumbered reserve and may add to the reserve in the manner prescribed in this section. Insurance reserve funds may be invested in the manner provided in section 1223. Income from the investment shall be considered a part of the "general fund". If an emergency is declared by a 2/3 vote of the members elected to and serving on the board, the insurance reserve funds may be borrowed for the emergency, but the funds shall be returned to the insurance reserve fund from the collection of taxes in the next ensuing fiscal year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The school board shall adopt a budget in the same manner and form as required for its estimates and, subject to limitations under law, determine the amount of tax levy necessary for the budget.

The superintendent shall not be a member of the board. Employment of a superintendent shall be by written contract. The term of the superintendent's contract shall be fixed by the board, not to exceed 5 years. If written notice of nonrenewal of the contract of a superintendent is not given at least 90 days before the termination of the contract, the contract is renewed for an additional 1-year period. However, for the superintendent of a community district, the minimum time period for the written notice required under this subsection is 30 days.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The board of a school district or intermediate school district may employ assistant superintendents, principals, assistant principals, guidance directors, and other administrators who do not assume tenure in that position under 1937 (Ex Sess) PA 4, MCL 38.71 to 38.191. The employment shall be by written contract. The term of the employment contract shall be fixed by the board, not to exceed 3 years. The board shall prescribe the duties of an individual described in this subsection. If written notice of nonrenewal of the contract of an individual described in this subsection is not given at least 60 days before the termination date of the contract, the contract is renewed for an additional 1-year period.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A notification of nonrenewal of contract of an individual described in subsection (2) may be given only for a reason that is not arbitrary or capricious. The board shall not issue a notice of nonrenewal under this section unless the affected individual has been provided with not less than 30 days' advance notice that the board is considering the nonrenewal together with a written statement of the reasons the board is considering the nonrenewal. However, for an individual described in subsection (2) who is employed by a community district, the minimum time period for the advance notice required under this subsection is 7 days.

The meeting shall be open to the public or a closed session, as the affected individual elects under section 8 of the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.268. If the board fails to provide for a meeting with the board, or if a court finds that the reason for nonrenewal is arbitrary or capricious, the affected individual's contract is renewed for an additional 1-year period. This subsection does not apply to the nonrenewal of the contract of a superintendent of schools described in subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A school district, instead of directly employing a superintendent of schools, may contract with its intermediate school district for the intermediate superintendent to serve as the superintendent of schools for the school district or for the intermediate school district to provide another person to serve as superintendent of schools for the school district or may contract with another person, including, but not limited to, the superintendent of another school district, to serve as superintendent of schools for the school district.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the board of a school district or intermediate school district or the governing body of a public school academy or nonpublic school determines it necessary to hire an individual or to allow an individual to regularly and continuously work under contract for a particular school year during that school year or within 30 days before the beginning of that school year, the board or governing body may employ the individual as a conditional employee or conditionally allow the individual to regularly and continuously work under contract under this subsection without first receiving the report described in subsection (8) if all of the following apply:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Criminal history record information received from the criminal records division of the department of state police under subsection (8) shall be used by a school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school only for the purpose of evaluating an individual's qualifications for employment or assignment in the position for which he or she has applied or been assigned and for the purposes of subsections (3), (4), (5), and (12).

For an individual who is regularly and continuously working under contract, if the individual agrees in writing, a district, public school academy, or nonpublic school may provide a copy of the results received under this section concerning the individual to an appropriate representative of the individual’s employer. A representative of the individual’s employer who receives a copy of a report, or receives results of a report from another source as authorized by this subsection, shall not disclose the report or its contents or the results of the report to any person outside of the employer’s business or to any of the employer’s personnel who are not directly involved in evaluating the individual’s qualifications for employment or assignment. A person who violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $10,000.00, but is not subject to the penalties under section 1804. As used in this subsection, "misdemeanor conviction involving sexual or physical abuse" includes, but is not limited to, a misdemeanor conviction for a listed offense; a misdemeanor conviction for violation of section 617a of the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.617a; a misdemeanor conviction for violation of section 701 of the Michigan liquor control code of 1998, 1998 PA 58, MCL 436.1701; a misdemeanor conviction for violation of section 81, 81a, 81c, 90c, 136b, 141a, 145, 145d, 145n, 233, 335a, or 411h of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.81, 750.81a, 750.81c, 750.90c, 750.136b, 750.141a, 750.145, 750.145d, 750.145n, 750.233, 750.335a, and 750.411h; a misdemeanor conviction of section 6 of 1979 PA 53, MCL 752.796; or a misdemeanor conviction for violation of a substantially similar law of another state, of a political subdivision of this state or another state, or of the United States.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Subject to subsection (12), if the criminal history check required under this section has been completed for a particular individual and the results reported to a school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school as provided under this section, then another criminal history check is not required under this section for that individual as long as the individual remains employed with no separation from service by any school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school in this state or remains regularly and continuously working under contract with no separation from service for the same employer in any school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school in this state. For the purposes of this subsection, an employee is not considered to have a separation from service in any of the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The employee is laid off or placed on a leave of absence by his or her employer and returns to active employment with the same employer within 1 year after being laid off or placed on the leave of absence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The employee transfers to another school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school and remains continuously employed by any school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If an individual described in subsection (11) is an applicant for employment in a different school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school than the one that originally received the results of the criminal history check or that currently is in possession of the results of the criminal history check, or is being assigned to regularly and continuously work under contract in a different school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school than the one that originally received the results of the criminal history check or that currently is in possession of the results of the criminal history check, then all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the results of the individual's criminal history check have not already been forwarded to the new school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school, the new school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school shall request the school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school that has the results to forward them to the new school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the results of the individual's criminal history check are not received by the new school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school under this subsection or otherwise, then this section applies to the individual to the same extent as if he or she has had a separation from service.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) In addition to the criminal history check required under section 1230, the board of a school district or intermediate school district or the governing body of a public school academy or nonpublic school shall request the department of state police to conduct a criminal records check through the federal bureau of investigation on an applicant for, or an individual who is hired for, any full-time or part-time employment or who is assigned to regularly and continuously work under contract in any of its schools. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a board or governing body shall not employ an individual or allow an individual to regularly and continuously work under contract in any of its schools until after the board or governing body receives the results of the criminal records check. A board or governing body requesting a criminal records check under this section shall require the individual to submit his or her fingerprints to the department of state police for that purpose. The department of state police may charge a fee for conducting the criminal records check. Subject to section 1230g, a board or governing body shall require an individual to submit his or her fingerprints for the purposes of this section only at the time the individual initially applies for employment with the board or governing body or is initially employed by the board or governing body or is initially assigned to regularly and continuously work under contract in any of its schools.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the board of a school district or intermediate school district or the governing body of a public school academy or nonpublic school determines it necessary to hire an individual or to allow an individual to regularly and continuously work under contract for a particular school year during that school year or within 30 days before the beginning of that school year, the board or governing body may employ the individual as a conditional employee or conditionally allow the individual to regularly and continuously work under contract under this subsection without first receiving the results of the criminal records check under subsection (1) if all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The board or governing body requests the criminal records check under subsection (1) before conditionally employing the individual or conditionally allowing the individual to regularly and continuously work under contract in any of its schools.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The individual signs a statement identifying all crimes for which he or she has been convicted, if any, and agreeing that, if the results of the criminal records check under subsection (1) reveal information that is inconsistent with the individual's statement, his or her employment contract is voidable at the option of the board or governing body. The department shall develop and distribute to districts and nonpublic schools a model form for the statement required under this subdivision. The department shall make the model form available to public school academies. A district, public school academy, or nonpublic school shall use the model form for the purposes of this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If an individual is employed as a conditional employee under subsection (2) and the results of the criminal records check under subsection (1) reveal information that is inconsistent with the individual's statement under subsection (2), the board or governing body may void the individual's employment contract. If an employment contract is voided under this subsection, the individual's employment is terminated, a collective bargaining agreement that would otherwise apply to the individual's employment does not apply to the termination, and the district, public school academy, or nonpublic school or the board or governing body is not liable for the termination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) For an applicant for a position as a substitute teacher or substitute bus driver, or for an individual who regularly and continuously works under contract in more than 1 school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school, if the applicant or individual agrees in writing to allow a district, public school academy, or nonpublic school to share the results of the criminal records check with another district, public school academy, or nonpublic school, then instead of requesting a criminal records check under subsection (1), a school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school may use results received by another district, public school academy, or nonpublic school or maintained by the department to confirm that the applicant or individual does not have any criminal history. If that confirmation is not available, subsection (1) applies to the applicant or individual. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If an applicant is being considered for employment by more than 1 school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school and if the applicant agrees in writing to allow a district, public school academy, or nonpublic school to share the results of the criminal records check with another district, public school academy, or nonpublic school, then a district, public school academy, or nonpublic school may satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) by obtaining a copy of the results of the criminal records check from another district, public school academy, or nonpublic school.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An applicant for employment shall give written consent at the time of application for the criminal records division of the department of state police to conduct the criminal records check required under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school shall make a request to the department of state police for a criminal records check under this section on a form and in a manner prescribed by the department of state police.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The results of a criminal records check under this section shall be used by a school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school only for the purpose of evaluating an individual's qualifications for employment or assignment in the position for which he or she has applied or been assigned and for the purposes of subsections (3), (4), (5), and (12). A member of the board of a district or of the governing body of a public school academy or nonpublic school or an employee of a district, public school academy, or nonpublic school shall not disclose those results received under this section, except a misdemeanor conviction involving sexual or physical abuse or any felony conviction, to any person who is not directly involved in evaluating the individual's qualifications for employment or assignment. However, for the purposes of subsections (4), (5), and (12) a person described in this subsection may provide a copy of the results received under this section concerning the individual to an appropriate representative of another district, public school academy, or nonpublic school. For an individual who is regularly and continuously working under contract, if the individual agrees in writing, a district, public school academy, or nonpublic school may provide a copy of the results received under this section concerning the individual to an appropriate representative of the individual’s employer. A representative of the individual’s employer who receives a copy of the results, or receives the results from another source as authorized by this subsection, shall not disclose the results to any person outside of the employer’s business or to any of the employer’s personnel who are not directly involved in evaluating the individual’s qualifications for employment or assignment. A person who violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $10,000.00, but is not subject to the penalties under section 1804. As used in this subsection, "misdemeanor conviction involving sexual or physical abuse" includes, but is not limited to, a misdemeanor conviction for a listed offense; a misdemeanor conviction for violation of section 617a of the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.617a; a misdemeanor conviction for violation of section 701 of the Michigan liquor control code of 1998, 1998 PA 58, MCL 436.1701; a misdemeanor conviction for violation of section 81, 81a, 81c, 90c, 136b, 141a, 145, 145d, 145n, 233, 335a, or 411h of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.81, 750.81a, 750.81c, 750.90c, 750.136b, 750.141a, 750.145, 750.145d, 750.145n, 750.233, 750.335a, and 750.411h; a misdemeanor conviction of section 6 of 1979 PA 53, MCL 752.796; or a misdemeanor conviction for violation of a substantially similar law of another state, of a political subdivision of this state or another state, or of the United States.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Within 30 days after receiving a proper request by a school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school for a criminal records check on an individual under this section, the criminal records division of the department of state police shall initiate the criminal records check through the federal bureau of investigation. After conducting the criminal records check required under this section for a school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school, the criminal records division of the department of state police shall provide the results of the criminal records check to the district, public school academy, or nonpublic school. A school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school that receives results from the department of state police under this subsection shall retain those results in the individual's employment records.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If the results received by a school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school under subsection (9), or a report received under section 1230, 1230d(7), 1535a(15), or 1539b(15), disclose that an individual has been convicted of a listed offense, then the school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school shall take steps to verify that information using public records and, if the information is verified, shall not employ the individual in any capacity, as provided under section 1230c, and shall not allow the individual to regularly and continuously work under contract in any of its schools. If the results received by a school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school under subsection (9), or a report received under section 1230, 1230d(7), 1535a(15), or 1539b(15), disclose that an individual has been convicted of a felony other than a listed offense, then the school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school shall take steps to verify that information using public records and, if the information is verified using public records, shall not employ the individual in any capacity or allow the individual to regularly and continuously work under contract in any of its schools unless the superintendent or chief administrator and the governing board or governing body, if any, of the school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school each specifically approves the employment or work assignment in writing. If a school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school receives results described in this subsection, within 60 days after receiving those results the school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school shall submit to the department in the form and manner prescribed by the department a report detailing the information and any action taken as a result by the school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school. The department shall maintain a copy of this report for at least 6 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Subject to subsection (12), if the criminal records check required under this section has been completed for a particular individual and the results reported to a school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school as provided under this section, then another criminal records check is not required under this section for that individual as long as the individual remains employed with no separation from service by any school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school in this state or remains regularly and continuously working under contract with no separation from service for the same employer in any school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school in this state. For the purposes of this subsection, an employee is not considered to have a separation from service in any of the following circumstances:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The employee transfers to another school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school and remains continuously employed by any school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If an individual described in subsection (11) is an applicant for employment in a different school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school than the one that originally received the results of the criminal records check or that currently is in possession of the results of the criminal records check, or is being assigned to regularly and continuously work under contract in a different school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school than the one that originally received the results of the criminal records check or that currently is in possession of the results of the criminal records check, then all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the results of the individual's criminal records check have not already been forwarded to the new school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school, the new school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school shall request the school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school that has the results to forward them to the new school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school. Upon receipt of such a request, a school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school that has the results shall forward them to the requesting school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the results of the individual's criminal records check are not received by the new school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school under this subsection or otherwise, then this section applies to the individual to the same extent as if he or she has had a separation from service.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Subject to subdivision (c), the board of a school district or intermediate school district shall not adopt, implement, maintain, or comply with a policy that provides that length of service or tenure status is the primary or determining factor in personnel decisions when conducting a staffing or program reduction or any other personnel determination resulting in the elimination of a position, when conducting a recall from a staffing or program reduction or any other personnel determination resulting in the elimination of a position, or in hiring after a staffing or program reduction or any other personnel determination resulting in the elimination of a position.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Subject to subdivision (c), the board of a school district or intermediate school district shall ensure that the school district or intermediate school district adopts, implements, maintains, and complies with a policy that provides that all personnel decisions when conducting a staffing or program reduction or any other personnel determination resulting in the elimination of a position, when conducting a recall from a staffing or program reduction or any other personnel determination resulting in the elimination of a position, or in hiring after a staffing or program reduction or any other personnel determination resulting in the elimination of a position, are based on retaining effective teachers. The policy shall ensure that a teacher who has been rated as ineffective under the performance evaluation system under section 1249 is not given any preference that would result in that teacher being retained over a teacher who is evaluated as minimally effective, effective, or highly effective under the performance evaluation system under section 1249. Effectiveness shall be measured by the performance evaluation system under section 1249, and the personnel decisions shall be made based on the following factors:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Individual performance shall be the majority factor in making the decision, and shall consist of but is not limited to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) Evidence of student growth, which shall be the predominant factor in assessing an employee's individual performance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) The teacher's demonstrated pedagogical skills, including at least a special determination concerning the teacher's knowledge of his or her subject area and the ability to impart that knowledge through planning, delivering rigorous content, checking for and building higher-level understanding, differentiating, and managing a classroom; and consistent preparation to maximize instructional time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(C) The teacher's management of the classroom, manner and efficacy of disciplining pupils, rapport with parents and other teachers, and ability to withstand the strain of teaching.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(D) The teacher's attendance and disciplinary record, if any.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Significant, relevant accomplishments and contributions. This factor shall be based on whether the individual contributes to the overall performance of the school by making clear, significant, relevant contributions above the normal expectations for an individual in his or her peer group and having demonstrated a record of exceptional performance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Relevant special training. This factor shall be based on completion of relevant training other than the professional development or continuing education that is required by the employer or by state law, and integration of that training into instruction in a meaningful way.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, length of service or tenure status shall not be a factor in a personnel decision described in subdivision (a) or (b). However, if that personnel decision involves 2 or more employees and all other factors distinguishing those employees from each other are equal, then length of service or tenure status may be considered as a tiebreaker.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a collective bargaining agreement is in effect for employees of a school district or intermediate school district as of the effective date of this section and if that collective bargaining agreement prevents compliance with subsection (1), then subsection (1) does not apply to that school district or intermediate school district until after the expiration of that collective bargaining agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a teacher brings an action against a school district or intermediate school district based on this section, the teacher's sole and exclusive remedy shall be an order of reinstatement commencing 30 days after a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction. The remedy in an action brought by a teacher based on this section shall not include lost wages, lost benefits, or any other economic damages.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to subsection (4), with the involvement of teachers and school administrators, the board of a school district or intermediate school district or board of directors of a public school academy shall adopt and implement for all teachers and school administrators a rigorous, transparent, and fair performance evaluation system that does all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Evaluates the teacher's or school administrator's job performance at least annually while providing timely and constructive feedback.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Establishes clear approaches to measuring student growth and provides teachers and school administrators with relevant data on student growth.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Evaluates a teacher's or school administrator's job performance, using multiple rating categories that take into account student growth and assessment data. Student growth must be measured using multiple measures that may include student learning objectives, achievement of individualized education program goals, nationally normed or locally developed assessments that are aligned to state standards, research-based growth measures, or alternative assessments that are rigorous and comparable across schools within the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy. If the performance evaluation system implemented by a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy under this section does not already include the rating of teachers as highly effective, effective, minimally effective, and ineffective, then the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall revise the performance evaluation system not later than September 19, 2011 to ensure that it rates teachers as highly effective, effective, minimally effective, or ineffective.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Uses the evaluations, at a minimum, to inform decisions regarding all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The effectiveness of teachers and school administrators, ensuring that they are given ample opportunities for improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Promotion, retention, and development of teachers and school administrators, including providing relevant coaching, instruction support, or professional development.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Whether to grant tenure or full certification, or both, to teachers and school administrators using rigorous standards and streamlined, transparent, and fair procedures.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Removing ineffective tenured and untenured teachers and school administrators after they have had ample opportunities to improve, and ensuring that these decisions are made using rigorous standards and streamlined, transparent, and fair procedures.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The board of a school district or intermediate school district or board of directors of a public school academy shall ensure that the performance evaluation system for teachers meets all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The performance evaluation system must include at least an annual year-end evaluation for all teachers. An annual year-end evaluation must meet all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) For the 2018-2019 school year, 25% of the annual year-end evaluation must be based on student growth and assessment data. Beginning with the 2019-2020 school year, 40% of the annual year-end evaluation must be based on student growth and assessment data.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) For core content areas in grades and subjects in which state assessments are administered, 50% of student growth must be measured using the state assessments, and the portion of student growth not measured using state assessments must be measured using multiple research-based growth measures or alternative assessments that are rigorous and comparable across schools within the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy. Student growth also may be measured by student learning objectives or nationally normed or locally adopted assessments that are aligned to state standards, or based on achievement of individualized education program goals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The portion of a teacher's annual year-end evaluation that is not based on student growth and assessment data, as described under subparagraph (i), must be based primarily on a teacher's performance as measured by the evaluation tool developed or adopted by the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy under subdivision (f).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The portion of a teacher's evaluation that is not measured using student growth and assessment data, as described under subparagraph (i), or using the evaluation tool developed or adopted by the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy, as described under subparagraph (iii), must incorporate criteria enumerated in section 1248(1)(b)(i) to (iii) that are not otherwise evaluated under subparagraph (i) or (iii).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If there are student growth and assessment data available for a teacher for at least 3 school years, the annual year-end evaluation must be based on the student growth and assessment data for the most recent 3-consecutive-school-year period. If there are not student growth and assessment data available for a teacher for at least 3 school years, the annual year-end evaluation must be based on all student growth and assessment data that are available for the teacher.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The annual year-end evaluation must include specific performance goals that will assist in improving effectiveness for the next school year and are developed by the school administrator or his or her designee conducting the evaluation, in consultation with the teacher, and any recommended training identified by the school administrator or designee, in consultation with the teacher, that would assist the teacher in meeting these goals. For a teacher described in subdivision (d), the school administrator or designee shall develop, in consultation with the teacher, an individualized development plan that includes these goals and training and is designed to assist the teacher to improve his or her effectiveness.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The performance evaluation system must include a midyear progress report for a teacher who is in the first year of the probationary period prescribed by section 1 of article II of 1937 (Ex Sess) PA 4, MCL 38.81, or who received a rating of minimally effective or ineffective in his or her most recent annual year-end evaluation. The midyear progress report must be used as a supplemental tool to gauge a teacher's improvement from the preceding school year and to assist a teacher to improve. All of the following apply to the midyear progress report:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The midyear progress report must be based at least in part on student achievement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The midyear progress report must be aligned with the teacher's individualized development plan under subdivision (c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The midyear progress report must include specific performance goals for the remainder of the school year that are developed by the school administrator conducting the annual year-end evaluation or his or her designee and any recommended training identified by the school administrator or designee that would assist the teacher in meeting these goals. At the midyear progress report, the school administrator or designee shall develop, in consultation with the teacher, a written improvement plan that includes these goals and training and is designed to assist the teacher to improve his or her rating.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The midyear progress report must not take the place of an annual year-end evaluation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The performance evaluation system must include classroom observations to assist in the performance evaluations. All of the following apply to these classroom observations:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A classroom observation must include a review of the teacher's lesson plan and the state curriculum standard being used in the lesson and a review of pupil engagement in the lesson.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A classroom observation does not have to be for an entire class period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Unless a teacher has received a rating of effective or highly effective on his or her 2 most recent annual year-end evaluations, there must be at least 2 classroom observations of the teacher each school year. At least 1 observation must be unscheduled.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The school administrator responsible for the teacher's performance evaluation shall conduct at least 1 of the observations. Other observations may be conducted by other observers who are trained in the use of the evaluation tool that is used under subdivision (f). These other observers may be teacher leaders.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) A school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall ensure that, within 30 days after each observation, the teacher is provided with feedback from the observation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) For the purposes of conducting annual year-end evaluations under the performance evaluation system, by the beginning of the 2016-2017 school year, the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall adopt and implement 1 or more of the evaluation tools for teachers that are included on the list under subsection (5). However, if a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy has 1 or more local evaluation tools for teachers or modifications of an evaluation tool on the list under subsection (5), and the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy complies with subsection (3), the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy may conduct annual year-end evaluations for teachers using 1 or more local evaluation tools or modifications. The evaluation tools must be used consistently among the schools operated by a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy so that all similarly situated teachers are evaluated using the same evaluation tool.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The performance evaluation system must assign an effectiveness rating to each teacher of highly effective, effective, minimally effective, or ineffective, based on his or her score on the annual year-end evaluation described in this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) As part of the performance evaluation system, and in addition to the requirements of section 1526, a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy is encouraged to assign a mentor or coach to each teacher who is described in subdivision (d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The performance evaluation system may allow for exemption of student growth data for a particular pupil for a school year upon the recommendation of the school administrator conducting the annual year-end evaluation or his or her designee and approval of the school district superintendent or his or her designee, intermediate superintendent or his or her designee, or chief administrator of the public school academy, as applicable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) The performance evaluation system must provide that, if a teacher is rated as ineffective on 3 consecutive annual year-end evaluations, the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall dismiss the teacher from his or her employment. This subdivision does not affect the ability of a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy to dismiss a teacher from his or her employment regardless of whether the teacher is rated as ineffective on 3 consecutive annual year-end evaluations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) The performance evaluation system must provide that, if a teacher is rated as highly effective on 3 consecutive annual year-end evaluations, the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy may choose to conduct a year-end evaluation biennially instead of annually. However, if a teacher is not rated as highly effective on 1 of these biennial year-end evaluations, the teacher shall again be provided with annual year-end evaluations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) The performance evaluation system must provide that, if a teacher who is not in a probationary period prescribed by section 1 of article II of 1937 (Ex Sess) PA 4, MCL 38.81, is rated as ineffective on an annual year-end evaluation, the teacher may request a review of the evaluation and the rating by the school district superintendent, intermediate superintendent, or chief administrator of the public school academy, as applicable. The request for a review must be submitted in writing within 20 days after the teacher is informed of the rating. Upon receipt of the request, the school district superintendent, intermediate superintendent, or chief administrator of the public school academy, as applicable, shall review the evaluation and rating and may make any modifications as appropriate based on his or her review. However, the performance evaluation system must not allow for a review as described in this subdivision more than twice in a 3-school-year period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) The school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall provide training to teachers on the evaluation tool or tools used by the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy in its performance evaluation system and on how each evaluation tool is used. This training may be provided by a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy, or by a consortium consisting of 2 or more of these.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) A school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall ensure that training is provided to all evaluators and observers. The training must be provided by an individual who has expertise in the evaluation tool or tools used by the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy, which may include either a consultant on that evaluation tool or framework or an individual who has been trained to train others in the use of the evaluation tool or tools. This subdivision does not prohibit a school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or consortium consisting of 2 or more of these, from providing the training in the use of the evaluation tool or tools if the trainer has expertise in the evaluation tool or tools.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall post on its public website all of the following information about the evaluation tool or tools it uses for its performance evaluation system for teachers:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The research base for the evaluation framework, instrument, and process or, if the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy adapts or modifies an evaluation tool from the list under subsection (5), the research base for the listed evaluation tool and an assurance that the adaptations or modifications do not compromise the validity of that research base.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The identity and qualifications of the author or authors or, if the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy adapts or modifies an evaluation tool from the list under subsection (5), the identity and qualifications of a person with expertise in teacher evaluations who has reviewed the adapted or modified evaluation tool.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Either evidence of reliability, validity, and efficacy or a plan for developing that evidence or, if the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy adapts or modifies an evaluation tool from the list under subsection (5), an assurance that the adaptations or modifications do not compromise the reliability, validity, or efficacy of the evaluation tool or the evaluation process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The evaluation frameworks and rubrics with detailed descriptors for each performance level on key summative indicators.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A description of the processes for conducting classroom observations, collecting evidence, conducting evaluation conferences, developing performance ratings, and developing performance improvement plans.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A description of the plan for providing evaluators and observers with training. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a collective bargaining agreement was in effect for teachers or school administrators of a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy as of July 19, 2011, if that same collective bargaining agreement is still in effect as of November 5, 2015, and if that collective bargaining agreement prevents compliance with subsection (1), then subsection (1) does not apply to that school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy until after the expiration of that collective bargaining agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The department shall establish and maintain a list of teacher evaluation tools that have demonstrated evidence of efficacy and that may be used for the purposes of this section. That list initially must include at least the evaluation models recommended in the final recommendations released by the Michigan council on educator effectiveness in July 2013. The list must include a statement indicating that school districts, intermediate school districts, and public school academies are not limited to only using the evaluation tools that are included on the list. A school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy is not required to use an evaluation tool for teacher evaluations that is the same as it uses for school administrator evaluations or that has the same author or authors as the evaluation tool it uses for school administrator evaluations. The department shall promulgate rules establishing standards and procedures for adding an evaluation tool to or removing an evaluation tool from the list. These rules must include a process for a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy to submit its own evaluation tool for review for placement on the list.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The training required under subsection (2) must be paid for from the funds available in the educator evaluation reserve fund created under section 95a of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1695a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) This section does not affect the operation or applicability of section 1248.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this section, "teacher" means an individual who has a valid Michigan teaching certificate or authorization or who is engaged to teach under section 1233b; who is employed, or contracted for, by a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy; and who is assigned by the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy to deliver direct instruction to pupils in any of grades K to 12 as a teacher of record.</div>

Subject to 1937 (Ex Sess) PA 4, MCL 38.71 to 38.191, this subdivision does not affect the ability of a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy to dismiss a teacher from the teacher's employment regardless of whether the teacher is rated as ineffective or needing support on 3 consecutive year-end evaluations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) The performance evaluation system must provide that, if a teacher who is not in a probationary period under section 1 of article II of 1937 (Ex Sess) PA 4, MCL 38.81, is rated as highly effective or effective on the 3 most recent consecutive year-end evaluations, the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy may conduct a year-end evaluation biennially or triennially instead of annually. However, if a teacher who is not in a probationary period under section 1 of article II of 1937 (Ex Sess) PA 4, MCL 38.81, is not rated as effective on 1 of these biennial or triennial year-end evaluations, the teacher must again be provided with year-end evaluations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) As used in this subdivision, "teacher" means that term as defined in section 1 of article I of 1937 (Ex Sess) PA 4, MCL 38.71. The performance evaluation system must provide that, for a teacher who is not in a probationary period under section 1 of article II of 1937 (Ex Sess) PA 4, MCL 38.81, and is rated as needing support on a year-end evaluation, the following options must be made available to the teacher:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The teacher may request a review of the evaluation and the rating by the school district superintendent or intermediate superintendent, as applicable. The request for a review must be submitted in writing within 30 calendar days after the teacher is informed of the rating. Upon receipt of the request, the school district superintendent or intermediate superintendent, as applicable, shall review the evaluation and rating and may make any modifications as appropriate based on the school district superintendent's or intermediate superintendent's review. A written response regarding the school district superintendent's or intermediate superintendent's findings must be provided to the teacher who requested the review by not later than 30 calendar days after receipt of the request for a review and before making any modifications under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the written response from the school district superintendent's or intermediate superintendent's review does not resolve the matter, the teacher or collective bargaining representative may request mediation as provided for in 1947 PA 336, 423.201 to 423.217. The request for mediation must be submitted in writing within 30 calendar days after the teacher receives the written response from the school district superintendent or intermediate superintendent. Within 15 days of receipt of the request, the school district superintendent or intermediate superintendent must provide a written response to the teacher or collective bargaining representative stating that the mediation will be scheduled as appropriate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If a teacher receives 2 consecutive ratings of needing support, the teacher may demand to use the grievance procedure of an applicable collective bargaining agreement or employment contract that concerns the teacher's second evaluation rating and the evaluation process. If a collective bargaining agreement or employment contract does not contain a grievance procedure that ends in binding arbitration, the teacher may request binding arbitration by filing a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association within 30 calendar days after the teacher receives the written response from the school district superintendent or intermediate superintendent. The arbitration is subject to the uniform arbitration act, 2012 PA 371, MCL 691.1681 to 691.1713. The arbitration described in this subparagraph must adhere to both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) The arbitrator must be selected through procedures administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its rules.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) The arbitrator must have the authority to issue any appropriate remedy.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The board of a school district or intermediate school district or board of directors of a public school academy shall ensure that the performance evaluation system for building-level school administrators and for central-office-level school administrators who are regularly involved in instructional matters meets all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The performance evaluation system must include at least an annual evaluation for all school administrators described in this subsection by the school district superintendent or his or her designee, intermediate superintendent or his or her designee, or chief administrator of the public school academy, as applicable. However, a superintendent or chief administrator shall be evaluated by the board or board of directors or, if the superintendent or chief administrator is not employed directly by the board or board of directors, by the designee of the board or board of directors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For the 2018-2019 school year, 25% of the annual evaluation must be based on student growth and assessment data. Beginning with the 2019-2020 school year, 40% of the annual evaluation must be based on student growth and assessment data. The student growth and assessment data to be used for the school administrator annual evaluation are the aggregate student growth and assessment data that are used in teacher annual year-end evaluations in each school in which the school administrator works as an administrator or, for a central-office-level school administrator, for the entire school district or intermediate school district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For the purposes of conducting annual evaluations under the performance evaluation system, the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall develop or adopt and implement an evaluation tool for school administrators. The portion of a school administrator's annual evaluation that is not based on student growth must be based primarily on the school administrator's performance as measured by this evaluation tool.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The portion of the annual evaluation that is not based on student growth and assessment data as provided under subdivision (b) or on an evaluation tool as provided under subdivision (c) must be based on at least the following for each school in which the school administrator works as an administrator or, for a central-office-level school administrator, for the entire school district or intermediate school district:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the school administrator conducts teacher performance evaluations, the school administrator's proficiency in using the evaluation tool for teachers used by the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy under section 1249. If the school administrator designates another person to conduct teacher performance evaluations, the evaluation of the school administrator on this factor must be based on the designee's proficiency in using the evaluation tool for teachers used by the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy under section 1249, with the designee's performance to be counted as if it were the school administrator personally conducting the teacher performance evaluations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The progress made by the school or school district in meeting the goals set forth in the school's school improvement plan or the school district's school improvement plans.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Pupil attendance in the school or school district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Student, parent, and teacher feedback, as available, and other information considered pertinent by the superintendent or other school administrator conducting the performance evaluation or the board or board of directors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) For the purposes of conducting annual evaluations under the performance evaluation system, by the beginning of the 2016-2017 school year, the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall adopt and implement 1 or more of the evaluation tools for school administrators that are included on the list under subsection (3). However, if a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy has 1 or more local evaluation tools for school administrators or modifications of an evaluation tool on the list under subsection (3), and the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy complies with subsection (2), the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy may conduct annual year-end evaluations for school administrators using 1 or more local evaluation tools or modifications.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The evaluation tool and other measures used by the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy in its performance evaluation system for school administrators must be used consistently across the schools operated by a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy so that all similarly situated school administrators are evaluated using the same measures.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The performance evaluation system must assign an effectiveness rating to each school administrator described in this subsection of highly effective, effective, minimally effective, or ineffective.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The performance evaluation system must ensure that if a school administrator described in this subsection is rated as minimally effective or ineffective, the person or persons conducting the evaluation shall develop and require the school administrator to implement an improvement plan to correct the deficiencies. The improvement plan must recommend professional development opportunities and other actions designed to improve the rating of the school administrator on his or her next annual evaluation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The performance evaluation system must provide that, if a school administrator described in this subsection is rated as ineffective on 3 consecutive annual evaluations, the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall dismiss the school administrator from his or her employment. This subdivision does not affect the ability of a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy to dismiss a school administrator from his or her employment regardless of whether the school administrator is rated as ineffective on 3 consecutive annual evaluations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) The performance evaluation system must provide that, if a school administrator is rated as highly effective on 3 consecutive annual evaluations, the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy may choose to conduct an evaluation biennially instead of annually. However, if a school administrator is not rated as highly effective on 1 of these biennial evaluations, the school administrator shall again be provided with annual evaluations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) The school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall provide training to school administrators on the measures used by the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy in its performance evaluation system for school administrators and on how each of the measures is used. This training may be provided by a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy, or by a consortium consisting of 2 or more of these.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) A school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall ensure that training is provided to all evaluators and observers. The training must be provided by an individual who has expertise in the evaluation tool or tools used by the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy, which may include either a consultant on that evaluation tool or framework or an individual who has been trained to train others in the use of the evaluation tool or tools. This subdivision does not prohibit a school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or consortium consisting of 2 or more of these, from providing the training in the use of the evaluation tool or tools if the trainer has expertise in the evaluation tool or tools.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall post on its public website all of the following information about the measures it uses for its performance evaluation system for school administrators:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The research base for the evaluation framework, instrument, and process or, if the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy adapts or modifies an evaluation tool from the list under subsection (3), the research base for the listed evaluation tool and an assurance that the adaptations or modifications do not compromise the validity of that research base.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The identity and qualifications of the author or authors or, if the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy adapts or modifies an evaluation tool from the list under subsection (3), the identity and qualifications of a person with expertise in teacher evaluations who has reviewed the adapted or modified evaluation tool.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Either evidence of reliability, validity, and efficacy or a plan for developing that evidence or, if the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy adapts or modifies an evaluation tool from the list under subsection (3), an assurance that the adaptations or modifications do not compromise the reliability, validity, or efficacy of the evaluation tool or the evaluation process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The evaluation frameworks and rubrics, with detailed descriptors for each performance level on key summative indicators.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A description of the processes for collecting evidence, conducting evaluation conferences, developing performance ratings, and developing performance improvement plans.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A description of the plan for providing evaluators and observers with training. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The department shall establish and maintain a list of school administrator evaluation tools that have demonstrated evidence of efficacy and that may be used for the purposes of this section. That list initially must include at least the 2 evaluation models recommended in the final recommendations released by the Michigan council on educator effectiveness in July 2013. The list must include a statement indicating that school districts, intermediate school districts, and public school academies are not limited to only using the evaluation tools that are included on the list. A school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy is not required to use an evaluation tool for school administrator evaluations that is the same as it uses for teacher evaluations or that has the same author or authors as the evaluation tool it uses for teacher evaluations. The department shall promulgate rules establishing standards and procedures for adding an evaluation tool to or removing an evaluation tool from the list. These rules must include a process for a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy to submit its own evaluation tool for review for placement on the list.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The training required under subsection (1) must be paid for from the funds available in the educator evaluation reserve fund created under section 95a of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1695a.</div>

However, if a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy has 1 or more local evaluation tools for school administrators or modifications of an evaluation tool on the list under subsection (3), and the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy complies with subsection (2), the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy may conduct annual evaluations for school administrators using 1 or more local evaluation tools or modifications.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The evaluation tool and other measures used by the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy in its performance evaluation system for school administrators must be used consistently across the schools operated by a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy so that all similarly situated school administrators are evaluated using the same measures.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Before July 1, 2024, the performance evaluation system must assign a rating to each school administrator described in this subsection of highly effective, effective, minimally effective, or ineffective. Beginning July 1, 2024, the performance evaluation system must assign a rating to each school administrator described in this subsection of effective, developing, or needing support. An evaluation and feedback concerning the evaluation must be provided, in writing, to the school administrator being evaluated. However, if a written evaluation is not provided, the school administrator is deemed effective.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) For a building-level school administrator's evaluation, the individual conducting the evaluation shall visit the school building where the building-level school administrator works, review the building-level school administrator's school improvement plan, and observe classrooms with the building-level school administrator to collect evidence of the school improvement plan strategies being implemented and the impact the school improvement plan has on learning.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A school administrator must not be assigned an evaluation rating and must be designated as unevaluated for a year if any of the following apply to the school administrator:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The school administrator worked less than 60 days in that year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The school administrator's evaluation results were vacated through the grievance procedure or arbitration described in subdivision (p) or (q). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) There are extenuating circumstances and the school administrator and the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy agree to designate the school administrator as unevaluated because of the extenuating circumstances.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) If a school administrator is designated as unevaluated under subdivision (i) the school administrator's rating from the year immediately before that designation must be used for consecutive purposes under this section if both of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The school administrator continues to be employed in the same position that the school administrator was employed in the year before the school administrator received the unevaluated designation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The school administrator continues to be employed by the same school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy that employed the school administrator in the year before the school administrator received the unevaluated designation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) The performance evaluation system must ensure that if a school administrator described in this subsection is rated as developing or needing support, the individual conducting the evaluation shall develop and require the school administrator to implement an improvement plan to correct the deficiencies. The improvement plan must recommend professional development opportunities and other actions designed to improve the rating of the school administrator on the school administrator's next evaluation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) The performance evaluation system must provide that, if a school administrator described in this subsection is rated as ineffective or needing support on 3 consecutive evaluations, the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall dismiss the school administrator from the school administrator's employment. This subdivision does not affect the ability of a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy to dismiss a school administrator from the school administrator's employment regardless of whether the school administrator is rated as ineffective or needing support on 3 consecutive evaluations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) The performance evaluation system must provide that, if a school administrator is rated as highly effective or effective on the 3 most recent consecutive evaluations, the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy may choose to conduct an evaluation biennially instead of annually. However, if any of the following occur, a school administrator's evaluation must be conducted annually:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The school administrator is not rated as effective on 1 of these biennial evaluations. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) For a building-level school administrator, the school administrator's supervisor or evaluator changes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) For an individual employed as a school district superintendent, an intermediate superintendent, or a chief administrator, the individual obtains employment with a different school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) The performance evaluation system must include a midyear progress report for a school administrator each year that the school administrator is evaluated. The midyear progress report must be used as a supplemental tool to gauge a school administrator's improvement from the preceding evaluation and to assist a school administrator to improve. Both of the following apply to the midyear progress report:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The midyear progress report must include specific performance goals for the remainder of the school year for building-level school administrators, or for the remainder of the calendar year for all other school administrators, that are developed by the individual conducting the annual evaluation or the individual's designee and any recommended training identified by the individual or designee that would assist the school administrator in meeting these goals. At the midyear progress report, the individual conducting the annual evaluation or the individual's designee shall develop, in consultation with the school administrator, a written improvement plan that includes these goals and training and is designed to assist the school administrator to improve the school administrator's rating.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The midyear progress report must not take the place of an annual evaluation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(o) As part of the performance evaluation system, a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall assign a mentor or coach to each school administrator, not including a school district superintendent, an intermediate superintendent, or a chief administrator, for the first 3 years in which the school administrator is in a new administrative position.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(p) The performance evaluation system must provide that, if a school administrator who is not a school district superintendent or an intermediate superintendent or who is not employed by or assigned to work at a public school academy is rated as needing support on an evaluation, the following options must be made available to the school administrator, as applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The school administrator may request a review of the evaluation and the rating by the school district superintendent or intermediate superintendent, as applicable. The request for a review must be submitted in writing within 30 calendar days after the school administrator is informed of the rating. Upon receipt of the request, the school district superintendent or intermediate superintendent, as applicable, shall review the evaluation and rating and may make any modifications as appropriate based on the school district superintendent's or intermediate superintendent's review. A written response regarding the school district superintendent's or intermediate superintendent's findings must be provided to the school administrator who requested the review by not later than 30 calendar days after receipt of the request for a review and before making any modifications under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the written response from the school district superintendent's or intermediate superintendent's review does not resolve the matter, the school administrator or collective bargaining representative may request mediation. The request for mediation must be submitted in writing within 30 calendar days after the school administrator receives the written response from the school district superintendent or intermediate superintendent. Within 15 days of receipt of the request, the school district superintendent or intermediate superintendent must provide a written response to the school administrator or collective bargaining representative stating that the mediation will be scheduled as appropriate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If the school administrator receives 2 consecutive ratings of needing support, the school administrator may demand to use the grievance procedure of an applicable collective bargaining agreement or of a contract governing the school administrator's employment that concerns the school administrator's second evaluation rating and the evaluation process. If a collective bargaining agreement or a contract governing the school administrator's employment does not contain a grievance procedure that ends in binding arbitration, the school administrator may request binding arbitration by filing a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association within 30 calendar days after the school administrator receives the written response from the school district superintendent or intermediate superintendent. The arbitration is subject to the uniform arbitration act, 2012 PA 371, MCL 691.1681 to 691.1713. The arbitration described in this subparagraph must adhere to both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) The arbitrator must be selected through procedures administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its rules.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) The arbitrator must have the authority to issue any appropriate remedy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(q) The contract governing the employment of a school district superintendent or intermediate superintendent must include an appeal process concerning the evaluation process and rating received. This subdivision applies only to a contract that is entered into, extended, renewed, or modified on or after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this sentence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(r) The school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall provide training to school administrators on the measures used by the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy in its performance evaluation system for school administrators and on how each of the measures is used. This training may be provided by a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy, or by a consortium consisting of 2 or more of these.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(s) A school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall ensure that training is provided to all evaluators and observers. The training must be provided by an individual who has expertise in the evaluation tool or tools used by the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy, which may include either a consultant on that evaluation tool or framework or an individual who has been trained to train others in the use of the evaluation tool or tools. This subdivision does not prohibit a school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or consortium consisting of 2 or more of these, from providing the training in the use of the evaluation tool or tools if the trainer has expertise in the evaluation tool or tools.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy shall post on its public website all of the following information about the measures it uses for its performance evaluation system for school administrators:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The research base for the evaluation framework, instrument, and process or, if the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy adapts or modifies an evaluation tool from the list under subsection (3), the research base for the listed evaluation tool and an assurance that the adaptations or modifications do not compromise the validity of that research base.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The identity and qualifications of the author or authors or, if the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy adapts or modifies an evaluation tool from the list under subsection (3), the identity and qualifications of a person with expertise in teacher evaluations who has reviewed the adapted or modified evaluation tool.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Either evidence of reliability, validity, and efficacy or a plan for developing that evidence or, if the school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy adapts or modifies an evaluation tool from the list under subsection (3), an assurance that the adaptations or modifications do not compromise the reliability, validity, or efficacy of the evaluation tool or the evaluation process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The evaluation frameworks and rubrics, with detailed descriptors for each performance level on key summative indicators.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A description of the processes for collecting evidence, conducting evaluation conferences, developing performance ratings, and developing performance improvement plans.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A description of the plan for providing evaluators and observers with training.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The department shall establish and maintain a list of school administrator evaluation tools that have demonstrated evidence of efficacy and that may be used for the purposes of this section. That list initially must include at least the 2 evaluation models recommended in the final recommendations released by the Michigan council on educator effectiveness in July 2013. The list must include a statement indicating that school districts, intermediate school districts, and public school academies are not limited to only using the evaluation tools that are included on the list. A school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy is not required to use an evaluation tool for school administrator evaluations that is the same as it uses for teacher evaluations or that has the same author or authors as the evaluation tool it uses for teacher evaluations. The department shall promulgate rules establishing standards and procedures for adding an evaluation tool to or removing an evaluation tool from the list. These rules must include a process for a school district, intermediate school district, or public school academy to submit its own evaluation tool for review for placement on the list.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) As used in this section, "student learning objectives" means that term as defined in section 1249.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The board of a school district shall not build a school upon a site without having prior title in fee to the site, a lease for not less than 99 years, or a lease for not less than 50 years from the United States government, or this state, or a political subdivision of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The board of a school district shall not build a frame school on a site for which it does not have a title in fee or a lease for 50 years without securing the privilege of removing the school.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The governing board of a public school shall not design or build a school building to be used for instructional or noninstructional school purposes or design and implement the design for a school site unless the design or construction is in compliance with 1937 PA 306, MCL 388.851 to 388.855a.

The forms for the reports required by this section shall be furnished by the state treasurer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An installment contract described in this section may include a lease-purchase agreement, which may be a multiyear contractual obligation that provides for automatic renewal unless positive action is taken by the board of the school district or intermediate school district to terminate that contract. Payments under a lease-purchase agreement are a current operating expense subject to annual appropriations of funds by the board of the school district or intermediate school district and shall obligate the board of the school district or intermediate school district only for those sums payable during the fiscal year of contract execution or any renewal year thereafter. The board of the school district or intermediate school district may make payments under a lease-purchase agreement from any legally available funds or from a combination of energy or operational savings, capital contributions, future replacement costs avoided, or billable revenue enhancements that result from energy conservation improvements or operational improvements to school facilities, if the board of the school district or intermediate school district has determined that those funds are sufficient to cover, in aggregate over the full term of the contractual agreement, the cost of the energy conservation improvements or operational improvements to school facilities. The lease-purchase agreement terminates immediately and absolutely and without further obligation on the part of the board of the school district or intermediate school district at the close of the fiscal year in which it was executed or renewed or at such time as appropriated and otherwise unobligated funds are no longer available to satisfy the obligations of the board of the school district or intermediate school district under the lease-purchase agreement. During the term of the lease-purchase agreement, the board of the school district or intermediate school district is the vested owner of the energy conservation improvements or operational improvements and may grant a security interest in the energy conservation improvements or operational improvements to the provider of the lease-purchase agreement. The board of the school district or intermediate school district shall not be obligated under a lease-purchase agreement for more than 20 years after either the date of the final completion of the energy conservation improvements or operational improvements to school facilities or the end of the useful life of the aggregate energy conservation improvements or operational improvements to school facilities, whichever occurs first. Upon the termination of the lease-purchase agreement and the satisfaction of the obligations of the board of the school district or intermediate school district, the provider of the lease-purchase agreement shall release its security interest in the energy conservation improvements or operational improvements.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) In addition to the requirements for accreditation under section 1280 specified in that section, if the board of a school district wants all of the schools of the school district to be accredited under section 1280, the board shall provide to all pupils attending public school in the district a core academic curriculum in compliance with subsection (3) in each of the curricular areas specified in the state board recommended model core academic curriculum content standards developed under subsection (2). The state board model core academic curriculum content standards shall encompass academic and cognitive instruction only. For purposes of this section, the state board model core academic curriculum content standards shall not include attitudes, beliefs, or value systems that are not essential in the legal, economic, and social structure of our society and to the personal and social responsibility of citizens of our society.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Recommended model core academic curriculum content standards shall be developed and periodically updated by the state board, shall be in the form of knowledge and skill content standards that are recommended as state standards for adoption by public schools in local curriculum formulation and adoption, and shall be distributed to each school district in the state. The recommended model core academic curriculum content standards shall set forth desired learning objectives in math, science, reading, history, geography, economics, American government, and writing for all children at each stage of schooling and be based upon the "Michigan K-12 Program Standards of Quality" to ensure that high academic standards, academic skills, and academic subject matters are built into the instructional goals of all school districts for all children. The state board shall ensure that the recommended model core academic curriculum content standards for history for grades 8 to 12 include learning objectives concerning genocide, including, but not limited to, the Holocaust and the Armenian Genocide. The state board also shall ensure that the state assessment program and the Michigan merit examination are based on the state recommended model core curriculum content standards, are testing only for proficiency in basic and advanced academic skills and academic subject matter, and are not used to measure pupils' values or attitudes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The board of each school district, considering academic curricular objectives defined and recommended pursuant to subsection (2), shall do both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Establish a core academic curriculum for its pupils at the elementary, middle, and secondary school levels. The core academic curriculum shall define academic objectives to be achieved by all pupils and shall be based upon the school district's educational mission, long-range pupil goals, and pupil performance objectives. The core academic curriculum may vary from the model core academic curriculum content standards recommended by the state board pursuant to subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) After consulting with teachers and school building administrators, determine the aligned instructional program for delivering the core academic curriculum and identify the courses and programs in which the core academic curriculum will be taught.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The board may supplement the core academic curriculum by providing instruction through additional classes and programs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) For all pupils, the subjects or courses, and the delivery of those including special assistance, that constitute the curriculum the pupils engage in shall assure the pupils have a realistic opportunity to learn all subjects and courses required by the district's core academic curriculum. A subject or course required by the core academic curriculum pursuant to subsection (3) shall be provided to all pupils in the school district by a school district, a consortium of school districts, or a consortium of 1 or more school districts and 1 or more intermediate school districts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) To the extent practicable, the state board may adopt or develop academic objective-oriented high standards for knowledge and life skills, and a recommended core academic curriculum, for special education pupils for whom it may not be realistic or desirable to expect achievement of initial mastery of the state board recommended model core academic content standards objectives or of a high school diploma.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The state board shall make available to all nonpublic schools in this state, as a resource for their consideration, the model core academic curriculum content standards developed for public schools pursuant to subsection (2) for the purpose of assisting the governing body of a nonpublic school in developing its core academic curriculum.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Excluding special education pupils, pupils having a learning disability, and pupils with extenuating circumstances as determined by school officials, a pupil who does not score satisfactorily on the fourth or seventh grade state assessment program reading test shall be provided special assistance reasonably expected to enable the pupil to bring his or her reading skills to grade level within 12 months.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Any course that would have been considered a nonessential elective course under Snyder v Charlotte School Dist, 421 Mich 517 (1984), on April 13, 1990 shall continue to be offered to resident pupils of nonpublic schools on a shared time basis.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The pupil's parent or legal guardian shall communicate with each of the pupil's teachers to monitor the pupil's progress toward the goals contained in the pupil's personal curriculum.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Revisions may be made in the personal curriculum if the revisions are developed and agreed to in the same manner as the original personal curriculum.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The English language arts credit requirements of subsection (1)(a) and the science credit requirements of subsection (1)(b) are not subject to modification as part of a personal curriculum under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The mathematics credit requirements of section 1278a(1)(a)(i) may be modified as part of a personal curriculum if the pupil successfully completes at least 3-1/2 total credits of the mathematics credits required under that section before completing high school, including algebra I and geometry, and successfully completes at least 1 mathematics credit during his or her final 2 years of high school. The algebra II credit required under that section may be modified as part of a personal curriculum under this subsection if the pupil meets 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Successfully completes the same content as 1 semester of algebra II, as determined by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Elects to complete the same content as algebra II over 2 years, with a credit awarded for each of those 2 years, and successfully completes that content. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Enrolls in a formal career and technical education program or curriculum and in that program or curriculum successfully completes the same content as the algebra II benchmarks assessed on the department-prescribed state high school assessment, as determined by the department.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) The visual arts, performing arts, or applied arts credit requirement under section 1278a(1)(a)(iv) may be modified as part of a personal curriculum only if the modification requires the pupil to complete 1 additional credit in English language arts, mathematics, or science or 1 additional credit in a language other than English, or requires the pupil to complete a formal career and technical education program. This additional credit must be in addition to the number of those credits otherwise required under subsection (1) and section 1278a(1) or under section 1278a(2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) If the parent or legal guardian of a pupil requests as part of the pupil's personal curriculum a modification of the Michigan merit standard requirements that would not otherwise be allowed under this section and demonstrates that the modification is necessary because the pupil is a child with a disability, the school district or public school academy may allow that additional modification to the extent necessary because of the pupil's disability if the group under subdivision (a) determines that the modification is consistent with both the pupil's educational development plan under subsection (11) and the pupil's individualized education program. If the superintendent of public instruction has reason to believe that a school district or a public school academy is allowing modifications inconsistent with the requirements of this subdivision, the superintendent of public instruction shall monitor the school district or public school academy to ensure that the school district's or public school academy's policies, procedures, and practices are in compliance with the requirements for additional modifications under this subdivision. As used in this subdivision, "child with a disability" means that term as defined in 20 USC 1401.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) If a pupil transfers to a school district or public school academy from out of state or from a nonpublic school, the pupil's parent or legal guardian may request, as part of the pupil's personal curriculum, a modification of the Michigan merit standard requirements that would not otherwise be allowed under this section. The school district or public school academy may allow this additional modification for a transfer pupil if all of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The transfer pupil has successfully completed at least the equivalent of 2 years of high school credit out of state or at a nonpublic school. The school district or public school academy may use appropriate assessment examinations to determine what credits, if any, the pupil has earned out of state or at a nonpublic school that may be used to satisfy the curricular requirements of the Michigan merit standard and this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The transfer pupil's personal curriculum incorporates as much of the subject area content expectations of the Michigan merit standard as is practicable for the pupil.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The transfer pupil's personal curriculum requires the pupil to successfully complete at least 1 mathematics course during his or her final year of high school enrollment. In addition, if the transfer pupil is enrolled in the school district or public school academy for at least 1 full school year, both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) The transfer pupil's personal curriculum must require that this mathematics course is at least algebra I.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) If the transfer pupil demonstrates that he or she has mastered the content of algebra I, the transfer pupil's personal curriculum must require that this mathematics course is a course normally taken after completing algebra I.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The transfer pupil's personal curriculum includes the civics course described in section 1166(2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) If a pupil is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, the pupil may act on his or her own behalf under this subsection.</div>

The annual notice must include an explanation of what a personal curriculum is and state that if a personal curriculum is requested, the public school or public school academy will grant that request. The school district or public school academy shall provide this annual notice to parents and legal guardians by sending a written notice to each pupil's home or by including the notice in a newsletter, student handbook, or similar communication that is sent to a pupil's home, and also shall post the notice on the school district's or public school academy's website.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a pupil receives special education services, the pupil's individualized education program, in accordance with the individuals with disabilities education act, title VI of Public Law 91-230, must identify the appropriate course or courses of study and identify the supports, accommodations, and modifications necessary to allow the pupil to progress in the curricular requirements of this section and section 1278a, or in a personal curriculum as provided under subsection (5), and meet the requirements for a high school diploma.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The board of a school district or board of directors of a public school academy that operates a high school shall ensure that each pupil is offered the curriculum necessary for the pupil to meet the curricular requirements of this section and section 1278a. The board or board of directors may provide this curriculum by providing the credits specified in this section and section 1278a, by using alternative instructional delivery methods such as alternative course work, humanities course sequences, career and technical education, industrial technology courses, or vocational education, or by a combination of these. School districts and public school academies that operate career and technical education programs are encouraged to integrate the credit requirements of this section and section 1278a into those programs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the board of a school district or board of directors of a public school academy wants its high school to be accredited under section 1280, the board or board of directors shall ensure that all elements of the curriculum required under this section and section 1278a are made available to all affected pupils. If a school district or public school academy does not offer all of the required credits, the board of the school district or board of directors of the public school academy shall ensure that the pupil has access to the required credits by another means, such as enrollment in a postsecondary course under the postsecondary enrollment options act, 1996 PA 160, MCL 388.511 to 388.524; enrollment in an online course; a cooperative arrangement with a neighboring school district or with a public school academy; or granting approval under section 6(6) of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1606, for the pupil to be counted in membership in another school district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If a pupil is not successfully completing a credit required for graduation under this section and section 1278a, or is identified as being at risk of withdrawing from high school, then the pupil's school district or public school academy shall notify the pupil's parent or legal guardian or, if the pupil is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, the pupil, of the availability of tutoring or other supplemental educational support and counseling services that may be available to the pupil under existing state or federal programs, such as those programs or services available under section 31a of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1631a, or under the no child left behind act of 2001, Public Law 107-110, or every student succeeds act, Public Law 114-95.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) To the extent required by the no child left behind act of 2001, Public Law 107-110, or every student succeeds act, Public Law 114-95, the board of a school district or public school academy shall ensure that all components of the curricular requirements under this section and section 1278a are taught by highly qualified teachers. If a school district or public school academy demonstrates to the department that the school district or public school academy is unable to meet the requirements of this section because the school district or public school academy is unable to hire enough highly qualified teachers, the department shall work with the school district or public school academy to develop a plan to allow the school district or public school academy to hire enough highly qualified teachers to meet the requirements of this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The board of a school district or board of directors of a public school academy shall provide the opportunity for each pupil to develop an educational development plan during grade 7, and shall ensure that each pupil reviews his or her educational development plan during grade 8 and revises it as appropriate before he or she begins high school.

An educational development plan must be developed, reviewed, and revised by the pupil under the supervision of the pupil's school counselor or another designee qualified to act in a counseling role under section 1233 or 1233a selected by the school principal and must be based on high school readiness scores and a career pathways program or similar career exploration program. An educational development plan must be designed to assist pupils to identify career development goals as they relate to academic requirements. During the process of developing and reviewing a pupil's educational development plan, the pupil must be advised that many of the curricular requirements of this section and section 1278a may be fulfilled through career and technical education. In addition, during the process of developing and reviewing an educational development plan, the pupil must be provided with all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Information on various types of careers and current and projected job openings in this state and those jobs' actual and projected wages.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An opportunity to explore careers specific to a pupil's interests and identify career pathways and goals for achieving success in those careers, including, but not limited to, the level and type of educational preparation necessary to accomplish those goals. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An opportunity to develop a talent portfolio. A talent portfolio must be developed and revised throughout the implementation of a pupil's educational development plan. A talent portfolio must include, but is not limited to, a record of the pupil's experiences, proficiencies, certifications, or accomplishments that demonstrate talents or marketable skills. The department, in conjunction with the department of labor and economic opportunity, shall develop and make available to the public schools model information materials that districts or public school academies may use to comply with this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if a school district or public school academy is unable to implement all of the curricular requirements of this section and section 1278a for pupils entering grade 9 in 2007 or is unable to implement another requirement of this section or section 1278a, the school district or public school academy may apply to the department for permission to phase in 1 or more of the requirements of this section or section 1278a. To apply, the school district or public school academy shall submit a proposed phase-in plan to the department. The department shall approve a phase-in plan if the department determines that the plan will result in the school district or public school academy making satisfactory progress toward full implementation of the requirements of this section and section 1278a. If the department disapproves a proposed phase-in plan, the department shall work with the school district or public school academy to develop a satisfactory plan that may be approved. This subsection does not apply to a high school that is designated as a specialty school under section 1278a(6) and that is exempt under that section from the English language arts requirement under subsection (1)(a) and the social science credit requirement under section 1278a(1)(a)(ii).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) This section and section 1278a do not prohibit a pupil from satisfying or exceeding the credit requirements of the Michigan merit standard under this section and section 1278a through advanced studies such as accelerated course placement, advanced placement, dual enrollment in a postsecondary institution, or participation in the international baccalaureate program or an early college/middle college program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) Not later than April 1 of each year, the department shall submit an annual report to the legislature that evaluates the overall success of the curriculum required under this section and section 1278a, the rigor and relevance of the course work required by the curriculum, the ability of public schools to implement the curriculum and the required course work, and the impact of the curriculum on pupil success, and that details any activities the department has undertaken to implement this section and section 1278a or to assist public schools in implementing the requirements of this section and section 1278a.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The board of a school district that does not want to be subject to the measures described in this section shall ensure that each public school within the school district is accredited.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) As used in subsection (1), and subject to subsection (6), "accredited" means certified by the superintendent of public instruction as having met or exceeded standards established under this section for 6 areas of school operation: administration and school organization, curricula, staff, school plant and facilities, school and community relations, and school improvement plans and student performance. The building-level evaluation used in the accreditation process shall include, but is not limited to, school data collection, self-study, visitation and validation, determination of performance data to be used, and the development of a school improvement plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The department shall develop and distribute to all public schools proposed accreditation standards. Upon distribution of the proposed standards, the department shall hold statewide public hearings for the purpose of receiving testimony concerning the standards. After a review of the testimony, the department shall revise and submit the proposed standards to the superintendent of public instruction. After a review and revision, if appropriate, of the proposed standards, the superintendent of public instruction shall submit the proposed standards to the senate and house committees that have the responsibility for education legislation. Upon approval by these committees, the department shall distribute to all public schools the standards to be applied to each school for accreditation purposes. The superintendent of public instruction shall review and update the accreditation standards annually using the process prescribed under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The superintendent of public instruction shall develop and distribute to all public schools standards for determining that a school is eligible for summary accreditation under subsection (6). The standards shall be developed, reviewed, approved, and distributed using the same process as prescribed in subsection (3) for accreditation standards, and shall be finally distributed and implemented not later than December 31, 1994.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The standards for accreditation or summary accreditation under this section shall include as criteria pupil performance on Michigan education assessment program (MEAP) tests and on the Michigan merit examination under section 1279g and, until the Michigan merit examination has been fully implemented, the percentage of pupils achieving state endorsement under section 1279, but shall not be based solely on pupil performance on MEAP tests or the Michigan merit examination or on the percentage of pupils achieving state endorsement under section 1279. The standards shall also include as criteria multiple year change in pupil performance on MEAP tests and the Michigan merit examination and, until after the Michigan merit examination is fully implemented, multiple year change in the percentage of pupils achieving state endorsement under section 1279. If it is necessary for the superintendent of public instruction to revise accreditation or summary accreditation standards established under subsection (3) or (4) to comply with this subsection, the revised standards shall be developed, reviewed, approved, and distributed using the same process as prescribed in subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the superintendent of public instruction determines that a public school has met the standards established under subsection (4) or (5) for summary accreditation, the school is considered to be accredited without the necessity for a full building-level evaluation under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the superintendent of public instruction determines that a school has not met the standards established under subsection (4) or (5) for summary accreditation but that the school is making progress toward meeting those standards, or if, based on a full building-level evaluation under subsection (2), the superintendent of public instruction determines that a school has not met the standards for accreditation but is making progress toward meeting those standards, the school is in interim status and is subject to a full building-level evaluation as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a school has not met the standards established under subsection (4) or (5) for summary accreditation and is not eligible for interim status under subsection (7), the school is unaccredited and subject to the measures provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Beginning with the 2002-2003 school year, if at least 5% of a public school's answer sheets from the administration of the Michigan educational assessment program (MEAP) tests are lost by the department or by a state contractor and if the public school can verify that the answer sheets were collected from pupils and forwarded to the department or the contractor, the department shall not assign an accreditation score or school report card grade to the public school for that subject area for the corresponding year for the purposes of determining state accreditation under this section. The department shall not assign an accreditation score or school report card grade to the public school for that subject area until the results of all tests for the next year are available.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Subsection (9) does not preclude the department from determining whether a public school or a school district has achieved adequate yearly progress for the school year in which the answer sheets were lost for the purposes of the no child left behind act of 2001, Public Law 107-110. However, the department shall ensure that a public school or the school district is not penalized when determining adequate yearly progress status due to the fact that the public school's MEAP answer sheets were lost by the department or by a state contractor, but shall not require a public school or school district to retest pupils or produce scores from another test for this purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The superintendent of public instruction shall annually review and evaluate for accreditation purposes the performance of each school that is unaccredited and as many of the schools that are in interim status as permitted by the department's resources.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The superintendent of public instruction shall, and the intermediate school district to which a school district is constituent, a consortium of intermediate school districts, or any combination thereof may, provide technical assistance, as appropriate, to a school that is unaccredited or that is in interim status upon request of the board of the school district in which the school is located. If requests to the superintendent of public instruction for technical assistance exceed the capacity, priority shall be given to unaccredited schools.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) A school that has been unaccredited for 3 consecutive years is subject to 1 or more of the following measures, as determined by the superintendent of public instruction:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The superintendent of public instruction or his or her designee shall appoint at the expense of the affected school district an administrator of the school until the school becomes accredited.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A parent, legal guardian, or person in loco parentis of a child who attends the school may send his or her child to any accredited public school with an appropriate grade level within the school district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The school, with the approval of the superintendent of public instruction, shall align itself with an existing research-based school improvement model or establish an affiliation for providing assistance to the school with a college or university located in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The school shall be closed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) The superintendent of public instruction shall evaluate the school accreditation program and the status of schools under this section and shall submit an annual report based upon the evaluation to the senate and house committees that have the responsibility for education legislation. The report shall address the reasons each unaccredited school is not accredited and shall recommend legislative action that will result in the accreditation of all public schools in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) Beginning with the 2008-2009 school year, a high school shall not be accredited by the department unless the department determines that the high school is providing or has otherwise ensured that all pupils have access to all of the elements of the curriculum required under sections 1278a and 1278b. If it is necessary for the superintendent of public instruction to revise accreditation or summary accreditation standards established under subsection (3) or (4) to comply with the changes made to this section by the amendatory act that added this subsection, the revised standards shall be developed, reviewed, approved, and distributed using the same process as prescribed in subsection (3).</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Require each board to maintain school or to provide educational opportunities for resident children for the statutory period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Prescribe appropriate uniform pupil and finance accounting records for use in school districts, public school academies, and intermediate school districts and promulgate rules for their adoption.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Require each board, each public school academy board of directors, and each intermediate school board to carry out the state board's recommendations relative to the safety of school buildings, equipment, and appurtenances, including any condition that may endanger the health or life of pupils.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Upon application by a school district, public school academy, university school, or intermediate school district, the state board may grant to the school district, public school academy, university school, or intermediate school district a limited time waiver from a state board or department rule interpreting or implementing a provision of this act. The state board may grant a waiver only if the school district, public school academy, university school, or intermediate school district demonstrates that it can address the intent of the rule in a more effective, efficient, or economical manner or that the waiver is necessary to stimulate improved pupil performance. A waiver shall not be granted for more than 3 years, but may be renewed. The state board may place conditions on a waiver or its renewal. The state board may revoke a waiver if it determines that the waiver no longer meets the criteria of this subsection, compromises equal opportunities for learning, or is detrimental to the educational interests of pupils. The state board may not grant a waiver from the duty to comply with a provision of this act, and may not grant a waiver from the duty to comply with another state statute unless and to the extent that a waiver is specifically allowed by that other state statute.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to subsection (2), the school board, or the school district superintendent, a school building principal, or another school district official if designated by the school board, may authorize or order the suspension or expulsion from school of a pupil who commits criminal sexual conduct against another pupil enrolled in the same school district or a pupil guilty of gross misdemeanor or persistent disobedience if, in the judgment of the school board or its designee, as applicable, the interest of the school is served by the authorization or order. If there is reasonable cause to believe that the pupil is a student with a disability, and the school district has not evaluated the pupil in accordance with rules of the superintendent of public instruction to determine if the pupil is a student with a disability, the pupil shall be evaluated immediately by the intermediate school district of which the school district is constituent in accordance with section 1711.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to subsection (3) and section 1310d, if a pupil possesses in a weapon free school zone a weapon that constitutes a dangerous weapon, commits arson in a school building or on school grounds, commits criminal sexual conduct in a school building or on school grounds, or pleads to, is convicted of, or is adjudicated for criminal sexual conduct against another pupil enrolled in the same school district, the school board, or the designee of the school board as described in subsection (1) on behalf of the school board, shall expel the pupil from the school district permanently, subject to possible reinstatement under subsection (6). However, a school board is not required to expel a pupil for possessing a weapon if the pupil establishes in a clear and convincing manner at least 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The object or instrument possessed by the pupil was not possessed by the pupil for use as a weapon, or for direct or indirect delivery to another individual for use as a weapon.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The weapon was not knowingly possessed by the pupil.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The pupil did not know or have reason to know that the object or instrument possessed by the pupil constituted a dangerous weapon.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The weapon was possessed by the pupil at the suggestion, request, or direction of, or with the express permission of, school or police authorities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) There is a rebuttable presumption that expulsion under subsection (2) for possession of a weapon is not justified if both of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The school board or its designee determines in writing that at least 1 of the factors listed in subsection (2)(a) to (d) has been established in a clear and convincing manner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The pupil has no history of suspension or expulsion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If an individual is expelled under subsection (2), the expelling school district shall enter on the individual's permanent record that he or she has been expelled under subsection (2). Except if a school district operates or participates cooperatively in an alternative education program appropriate for individuals expelled under subsection (2) and in its discretion admits the individual to that program, and except for a strict discipline academy established under sections 1311b to 1311m or a cyber school as defined in section 551, an individual expelled under subsection (2) is expelled from all public schools in this state and the officials of a school district shall not allow the individual to enroll in the school district unless the individual has been reinstated under subsection (6). Except as otherwise provided by law, a program operated for individuals expelled under subsection (2) shall ensure that those individuals are physically separated at all times during the school day from the general pupil population. If an individual expelled from a school district under subsection (2) is not placed in an alternative education program, strict discipline academy, or cyber school, the school district may provide, or may arrange for the intermediate school district to provide, appropriate instructional services to the individual at home. The type of services provided shall meet the requirements of section 6(4)(u) of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1606, and the services may be contracted for in the same manner as services for homebound pupils under section 109 of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1709. This subsection does not require a school district to expend more money for providing services for a pupil expelled under subsection (2) than the amount of the foundation allowance the school district receives for the pupil as calculated under section 20 of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1620.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a school board expels an individual under subsection (2), the school board shall ensure that, within 3 days after the expulsion, an official of the school district refers the individual to the appropriate county department of social services or county community mental health agency and notifies the individual's parent or legal guardian or, if the individual is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, notifies the individual of the referral.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The parent or legal guardian of an individual expelled under subsection (2) or, if the individual is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, the individual may petition the expelling school board for reinstatement of the individual to public education in the school district. If the expelling school board denies a petition for reinstatement, the parent or legal guardian or, if the individual is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, the individual may petition another school board for reinstatement of the individual in that other school district. All of the following apply to reinstatement under this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For an individual who was enrolled in grade 5 or below at the time of the expulsion and who has been expelled for possessing a firearm or threatening another person with a dangerous weapon, the parent or legal guardian or, if the individual is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, the individual may initiate a petition for reinstatement at any time after the expiration of 60 school days after the date of expulsion. For an individual who was enrolled in grade 5 or below at the time of the expulsion and who has been expelled under subsection (2) for a reason other than possessing a firearm or threatening another person with a dangerous weapon, the parent or legal guardian or, if the individual is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, the individual may initiate a petition for reinstatement at any time. For an individual who was in grade 6 or above at the time of expulsion, the parent or legal guardian or, if the individual is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, the individual may initiate a petition for reinstatement at any time after the expiration of 150 school days after the date of expulsion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An individual who was in grade 5 or below at the time of the expulsion and who has been expelled for possessing a firearm or threatening another person with a dangerous weapon shall not be reinstated before the expiration of 90 school days after the date of expulsion. An individual who was in grade 5 or below at the time of the expulsion and who has been expelled under subsection (2) for a reason other than possessing a firearm or threatening another person with a dangerous weapon shall not be reinstated before the expiration of 10 school days after the date of the expulsion. An individual who was in grade 6 or above at the time of the expulsion shall not be reinstated before the expiration of 180 school days after the date of expulsion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) It is the responsibility of the parent or legal guardian or, if the individual is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, of the individual to prepare and submit the petition. A school board is not required to provide any assistance in preparing the petition. Upon request by a parent or legal guardian or, if the individual is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, by the individual, a school board shall make available a form for a petition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Not later than 10 school days after receiving a petition for reinstatement under this subsection, a school board shall appoint a committee to review the petition and any supporting information submitted by the parent or legal guardian or, if the individual is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, by the individual. The committee shall consist of 2 school board members, 1 school administrator, 1 teacher, and 1 parent of a pupil in the school district. During this time the superintendent of the school district may prepare and submit for consideration by the committee information concerning the circumstances of the expulsion and any factors mitigating for or against reinstatement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Not later than 10 school days after all members are appointed, the committee described in subdivision (d) shall review the petition and any supporting information and information provided by the school district and shall submit a recommendation to the school board on the issue of reinstatement. The recommendation shall be for unconditional reinstatement, for conditional reinstatement, or against reinstatement, and shall be accompanied by an explanation of the reasons for the recommendation and of any recommended conditions for reinstatement. The recommendation shall be based on consideration of all of the following factors:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The extent to which reinstatement of the individual would create a risk of harm to pupils or school personnel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The extent to which reinstatement of the individual would create a risk of school district liability or individual liability for the school board or school district personnel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The age and maturity of the individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The individual's school record before the incident that caused the expulsion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) The individual's attitude concerning the incident that caused the expulsion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) The individual's behavior since the expulsion and the prospects for remediation of the individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vii) If the petition was filed by a parent or legal guardian, the degree of cooperation and support that has been provided by the parent or legal guardian and that can be expected if the individual is reinstated, including, but not limited to, receptiveness toward possible conditions placed on the reinstatement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Not later than the next regularly scheduled board meeting after receiving the recommendation of the committee under subdivision (e), a school board shall make a decision to unconditionally reinstate the individual, conditionally reinstate the individual, or deny reinstatement of the individual. The decision of the school board is final.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) A school board may require an individual and, if the petition was filed by a parent or legal guardian, his or her parent or legal guardian to agree in writing to specific conditions before reinstating the individual in a conditional reinstatement.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to section 1310d, if a pupil enrolled in grade 6 or above commits a physical assault at school against a person employed by or engaged as a volunteer or contractor by the school board and the physical assault is reported to the school board, school district superintendent, or building principal by the victim or, if the victim is unable to report the assault, by another person on the victim's behalf, then the school board, or the designee of the school board as described in section 1311(1) on behalf of the school board, shall expel the pupil from the school district permanently, subject to possible reinstatement under subsection (5). A district superintendent or building principal who receives a report described in this subsection shall forward the report to the school board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to section 1310d, if a pupil enrolled in grade 6 or above commits a verbal assault, as defined by school board policy, at school against a person employed by or engaged as a volunteer or contractor by the school board and the verbal assault is reported to the school board, school district superintendent, or building principal by the victim or, if the victim is unable to report the verbal assault, by another person on the victim's behalf, or if a pupil enrolled in grade 6 or above makes a bomb threat or similar threat directed at a school building, other school property, or a school-related event, then the school board, or the designee of the school board as described in section 1311(1) on behalf of the school board, shall suspend or expel the pupil from the school district for a period of time as determined in the discretion of the school board or its designee. A district superintendent or building principal who receives a report described in this subsection shall forward the report to the school board. Notwithstanding section 1147, a school district is not required to allow an individual expelled from another school district under this subsection to attend school in the school district during the expulsion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If an individual is permanently expelled pursuant to this section, the expelling school district shall enter on the individual's permanent record that he or she has been permanently expelled pursuant to this section. Except if a school district operates or participates cooperatively in an alternative education program appropriate for individuals expelled pursuant to this section and section 1311(2) and in its discretion admits the individual to that program, and except for a strict discipline academy established under sections 1311b to 1311m, an individual permanently expelled pursuant to this section is expelled from all public schools in this state and the officials of a school district shall not allow the individual to enroll in the school district unless the individual has been reinstated under subsection (5). Except as otherwise provided by law, a program operated for individuals expelled pursuant to this section and section 1311(2) shall ensure that those individuals are physically separated at all times during the school day from the general pupil population. If an individual permanently expelled from a school district pursuant to this section is not placed in an alternative education program or strict discipline academy, the school district may provide, or may arrange for the intermediate school district to provide, appropriate instructional services to the individual at home. The type of services provided shall meet the requirements of section 6(4)(u) of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1606, and the services may be contracted for in the same manner as services for homebound pupils under section 109 of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1709. This subsection does not require a school district to expend more money for providing services for a pupil permanently expelled pursuant to this section than the amount of the foundation allowance the school district receives for the pupil under section 20 of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1620.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a school board permanently expels an individual pursuant to this section, the school board shall ensure that, within 3 days after the expulsion, an official of the school district refers the individual to the appropriate county department of social services or county community mental health agency and notifies the individual's parent or legal guardian or, if the individual is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, notifies the individual of the referral.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The parent or legal guardian of an individual permanently expelled pursuant to this section or, if the individual is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, the individual may petition the expelling school board for reinstatement of the individual to public education in the school district. If the expelling school board denies a petition for reinstatement, the parent or legal guardian or, if the individual is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, the individual may petition another school board for reinstatement of the individual in that other school district. All of the following apply to reinstatement under this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The individual's parent or legal guardian or, if the individual is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, the individual may initiate a petition for reinstatement at any time after the expiration of 150 school days after the date of expulsion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The individual shall not be reinstated before the expiration of 180 school days after the date of expulsion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) It is the responsibility of the parent or legal guardian or, if the individual is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, of the individual to prepare and submit the petition. A school board is not required to provide any assistance in preparing the petition. Upon request by a parent or legal guardian or, if the individual is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, by the individual, a school board shall make available a form for a petition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Not later than 10 school days after receiving a petition for reinstatement under this subsection, a school board shall appoint a committee to review the petition and any supporting information submitted by the parent or legal guardian or, if the individual is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, by the individual.

During this time the superintendent of the school district may prepare and submit for consideration by the committee information concerning the circumstances of the expulsion and any factors mitigating for or against reinstatement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Not later than 10 school days after all members are appointed, the committee described in subdivision (d) shall review the petition and any supporting information and information provided by the school district and shall submit a recommendation to the school board on the issue of reinstatement. The recommendation shall be for unconditional reinstatement, for conditional reinstatement, or against reinstatement, and shall be accompanied by an explanation of the reasons for the recommendation and of any recommended conditions for reinstatement. The recommendation shall be based on consideration of all of the following factors:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The extent to which reinstatement of the individual would create a risk of harm to pupils or school personnel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The extent to which reinstatement of the individual would create a risk of school district or individual liability for the school board or school district personnel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The age and maturity of the individual.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) The individual's behavior since the expulsion and the prospects for remediation of the individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vii) If the petition was filed by a parent or legal guardian, the degree of cooperation and support that has been provided by the parent or legal guardian and that can be expected if the individual is reinstated, including, but not limited to, receptiveness toward possible conditions placed on the reinstatement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Not later than the next regularly scheduled board meeting after receiving the recommendation of the committee under subdivision (e), a school board shall make a decision to unconditionally reinstate the individual, conditionally reinstate the individual, or deny reinstatement of the individual. The decision of the school board is final.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) A school board may require an individual and, if the petition was filed by a parent or legal guardian, his or her parent or legal guardian to agree in writing to specific conditions before reinstating the individual in a conditional reinstatement. The conditions may include, but are not limited to, agreement to a behavior contract, which may involve the individual, parent or legal guardian, and an outside agency; participation in or completion of an anger management program or other appropriate counseling; periodic progress reviews; and specified immediate consequences for failure to abide by a condition. A parent or legal guardian or, if the individual is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, the individual may include proposed conditions in a petition for reinstatement submitted under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A school board or school administrator that complies with this section is not liable for damages for suspending or expelling a pupil pursuant to this section, and the authorizing body of a public school academy is not liable for damages for suspension or expulsion of a pupil by the public school academy pursuant to this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The department shall develop and distribute to all school districts a form for a petition for reinstatement to be used under subsection (5). The department may designate the form used for a petition for reinstatement under section 1311 as a form that may be used under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) This section does not diminish any rights under federal law of a pupil who has been determined to be eligible for special education programs and services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If a pupil expelled from a school district pursuant to this section is enrolled by a public school district sponsored alternative education program or a public school academy during the period of expulsion, the public school academy or the alternative education program is immediately eligible for the prorated share of either the public school academy's or operating school district's foundation allowance or the expelling school district's foundation allowance, whichever is higher.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A school board or its designee shall report all assaults described in subsection (1) or (2) to appropriate state or local law enforcement officials and prosecutors as provided in the statewide school safety information policy under section 1308.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If an individual is expelled pursuant to this section, it is the responsibility of that individual and of his or her parent or legal guardian to locate a suitable educational program and to enroll the individual in such a program during the expulsion. The office for safe schools in the department shall compile information on and catalog existing alternative education programs or schools and nonpublic schools that may be open to enrollment of individuals expelled pursuant to this section and pursuant to section 1311(2), and shall periodically distribute this information to school districts for distribution to expelled individuals.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Except for a foreign exchange student who is not a United States citizen, a strict discipline academy shall not enroll a pupil who is not a resident of this state. Enrollment in the strict discipline academy may be open to all individuals who reside in this state who meet the admission policy under subsections (3) to (5) and shall be open to all pupils who reside within the geographic boundaries, if any, of the authorizing body as described in section 1311d who meet the admission policy under subsections (3) to (5), except that admission to a strict discipline academy authorized by the board of a community college to operate, or operated by the board of a community college, on the grounds of a federal military installation, as described in section 1311d, shall be open to all pupils who reside in the county in which the federal military installation is located who meet the admission policy under subsections (3) to (5).

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Notwithstanding section 1351, a school district that has an operating or projected operating deficit or that has outstanding state aid anticipation notes issued under section 1225 through the Michigan finance authority may, with the approval of the state treasurer, borrow and issue notes or bonds for the purpose of eliminating the deficit or refunding or refinancing the state aid anticipation notes and related multiyear repayment obligations in accordance with this section. Notes or bonds issued under this section shall be known as school financing stability bonds. This authority is in addition to and not in derogation of any power granted to a school district by any other provision of this act. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Before a school district issues notes or bonds under this section, the board of the school district shall provide by resolution for the submission of the following certified and substantiated information to the department of treasury:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) There exists or will exist an operating deficit in the school district or the school district has outstanding state aid anticipation notes issued under section 1225 through the Michigan finance authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the school district has a deficit, during or before the fiscal year in which the application is made, the school district has made every available effort to offset the deficit. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The school district has a plan approved by the state treasurer that outlines actions to be taken to balance future expenditures with anticipated revenues and to repay any bonds or notes issued under this section. The state treasurer may recognize a deficit elimination plan or an enhanced deficit elimination plan authorized under section 102 of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1702, as satisfying the requirements for an approved plan under this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The existence of an operating or projected operating deficit, the amount of the operating or projected operating deficit, and the amount necessary to refund or refinance any school aid anticipation notes issued under section 1225 through the Michigan finance authority shall be determined by the department of treasury, using normal school accounting practices. If a financial audit is required to arrive at a conclusive determination as to the amount of a deficit, the state treasurer shall charge all necessary expenses for the audit, including per diem and travel expenses, to the school district, and the school district shall make payment to the state treasurer for these expenses. A determination by the department of treasury under this subsection is final and conclusive. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The notes or bonds may be issued in 1 or more series by resolution adopted by the school board, which resolution in each case shall make reference to the determination of the department of treasury under subsection (3). The amount of a note or bond issued shall not exceed the amount determined by the department of treasury under subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The school district may pledge as security for the repayment of principal and interest on notes or bonds issued under this section money from state school aid payments paid or payable to the school district, revenue from taxes levied by the school district for school operating purposes under section 1211, and other tax revenue or money of the district legally available as security. A pledge under this subsection is valid and binding from the time the pledge is made. A pledge under this subsection for the benefit of the holders of notes or bonds or for the benefit of others is perfected without delivery, recording, or notice. A school district may enter into an agreement with the department of treasury or the Michigan finance authority, or both, providing for the direct payment on behalf of the school district to the Michigan finance authority or a designated trustee of state school aid pledged for the repayment of principal and interest on notes or bonds issued under this section in the same manner as an agreement under section 17a(4) of the state school aid act of 1979, MCL 388.1617a. A school district also may provide for the deposit of revenues pledged for the payment of notes or bonds issued under this section in a separate account to pay principal and interest on notes or bonds, associated administrative costs, and any other obligations issued by the school district secured by the revenues. If the school district enters into an agreement with a person with a duty or obligation to collect for, pay, remit, disburse, or distribute to the school district all or a portion of the revenues pledged by the school district under this section, then the agreement must also provide for the direct payment of the revenues that the person has a duty or obligation to collect for, pay, remit, disburse, or distribute to the school district, and that the school district has pledged for payment of the notes or bonds issued under this section, to a trustee to be deposited in a trust account and used only for paying principal of and interest on the notes or bonds and related administrative costs and any other obligations issued or owing by the school district and secured by the revenues. If a school district has entered into an agreement with a trustee for the deposit of revenues pledged by a school district into a trust account, then after the issuance of the notes or bonds and before the deposit of the revenues of the school district into that trust account, the revenues of the school district to be deposited are held in trust for the benefit of the trustee and the notes or bonds by any persons coming into possession of the revenues. The revenues are held in trust for the benefit of the trustee and the notes or bonds whether the school district directly collects the revenues, another person collects the revenues, or any other person comes into possession of the revenues, and the revenues remain subject to the trust regardless of any subsequent transfer of the revenues until the revenues are deposited into the trust account. If the school district or other person holds a residual or other interest in the revenues held in trust and to be deposited with the trustee in the trust account, the interest is subordinate to a lien on the revenues in favor of the trustee for the purpose of ensuring delivery of the revenues to the trust account. The lien arises by operation of law and without further act or notice of any kind at the earliest time that the school district has or acquires any rights in the revenues pledged under the agreement, is and will remain paramount and superior to any other lien and interest of any kind, and is perfected without delivery, recording, or notice. The revenues held in trust and to be deposited into the trust account under this subsection are exempt from being levied upon, taken, sequestered, or applied toward paying the debts or liabilities of the school district other than those expressly specified in the agreement described in this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The notes or bonds shall mature serially with annual maturities not more than 25 years from their date and shall bear interest, payable annually or semiannually, at a rate or rates not exceeding a rate determined by the school board in the school district's borrowing resolution. The first principal installment on the notes or bonds shall be due not more than 18 months from the date of the issuance of the notes or bonds. The notes or bonds may be made subject to redemption before maturity with or without premium in a manner and at times provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the notes or bonds.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Notes or bonds issued under this section are valid and binding general obligations of the school district, it being the intent and purpose that the notes or bonds and the interest on the notes or bonds be promptly paid when due from the first money available to the school district not pledged for other indebtedness and except to the extent that the use is restricted by the state constitution of 1963 or the laws of the United States. If a school district does not receive state school aid, the validity of a note or bond issued under this section is not affected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Except as otherwise provided in this section, and unless the state treasurer approves an exception, bonds and notes issued under this section are subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The proceeds of the sale of notes or bonds authorized under this section, after payment of the costs of issuance of the notes or bonds and interest on the notes or bonds, shall be used solely for the purpose of paying necessary operating expenses of the school district, including the payment of principal of and interest on notes or bonds of the school district issued for operating purposes under this or any other act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A board of a school district that borrows under this section shall submit its budget for review and approval to the department of treasury. The department of treasury shall take necessary steps, subject to the school district's contracts and statutory obligations, to assure that the expenditures of a school district that receives money under this part shall not exceed revenues on an annual basis and that the school district maintains a balanced budget.</div>

If the court receives a form as provided under section 1230d, the court shall notify the superintendent of public instruction and any public school, school district, intermediate school district, or nonpublic school in which the person is employed by forwarding to each of them a copy of the form and information regarding the sentence imposed on the person not later than 7 days after the date of sentencing, even if the court is maintaining the file as a nonpublic record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Not later than 7 days after receiving notification from the prosecuting attorney or the court under subsection (7) or learning through an authoritative source that a person who holds a teaching certificate has been convicted of a crime listed in subsection (1), the superintendent of public instruction shall request the court to provide a certified copy of the judgment of conviction and sentence or other document regarding the disposition of the case to the superintendent of public instruction and shall pay any fees required by the court.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) For the purposes of this section, a certified copy of the judgment of conviction and sentence is conclusive evidence of conviction of a crime described in this section. For the purposes of this section, conviction of a crime described in this section is considered to be reasonably and adversely related to the ability of the person to serve in an elementary or secondary school and is sufficient grounds for suspension or revocation of the person's teaching certificate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) For any hearing under subsection (1), if the superintendent of public instruction does not make a final decision and order within 120 working days after receiving the request for the hearing, as required under subsection (1), the superintendent of public instruction shall submit a report detailing the reasons for the delay to the standing committees and appropriations subcommittees of the senate and house of representatives that have jurisdiction over education and education appropriations. The failure of the superintendent of public instruction to make a final decision and order within this 120 working day time limit, or the failure of any other official or agency to meet a time limit prescribed in this section, does not affect the validity of an action taken under this section affecting a person's teaching certificate.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Limit the rights and powers granted to a school district or intermediate school district under a collective bargaining agreement, this act, or another statute to discipline or discharge a person who holds a teaching certificate.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) The department of technology, management, and budget shall work with the department and the department of state police to develop and implement an automated program that does a comparison of the department's list of individuals holding a teaching certificate or state board approval, and of any other list maintained by the department of individuals employed or regularly and continuously working under contract in a school, with the conviction information received by the department of state police. This comparison shall only include individuals who are actually school employees at the time of the comparison or who are regularly and continuously working under contract at the time of the comparison.

If a comparison discloses that a person on the department's list of individuals holding a teaching certificate or state board approval has been convicted of a crime, or if the department is otherwise notified by the department of state police that such a person has been convicted of a crime, the department shall notify the superintendent or chief administrator and the board or governing body of the school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school in which the person is employed of that conviction.</div>

The department shall take all reasonable and necessary measures using the available technology to ensure the accuracy of this comparison before notifying a school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school of a conviction. If a comparison discloses that a person on the department's list of individuals holding a teaching certificate or state board approval has been convicted of a crime, or if the department is otherwise notified by the department of state police that such a person has been convicted of a crime, the department shall notify the superintendent or chief administrator and the board or governing body of the school district, intermediate school district, public school academy, or nonpublic school in which the person is employed of that conviction.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Taxes shall be collected on or before September 14 and all taxes and interest imposed pursuant to subdivision (f) unpaid before March 1 shall be returned as delinquent on March 1. Taxes delinquent under this subdivision shall be collected pursuant to Act No. 206 of the Public Acts of 1893, as amended.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Interest shall be added to taxes collected after September 14 at that rate imposed by section 59 of Act No. 206 of the Public Acts of 1893, being section 211.59 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, on delinquent property tax levies which became a lien in the same year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   All or a portion of fees or charges, or both, authorized under section 44 of Act No. 206 of the Public Acts of 1893, being section 211.44 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, may be imposed on taxes paid before March 1 and shall be retained by the treasurer actually performing the collection of the summer property tax levy of the school district or intermediate school district, regardless of whether all or part of these fees or charges, or both, have been waived by the township or city.</DIV>

The current school tax collection fund shall be segregated from all other funds and once the current school tax collection fund has been established money shall not be withdrawn except upon an order, check, or draft of the collecting treasurer for the purpose of paying 1 or more of the following costs:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The cost of special deputy treasurers and equipment directly involved in the collection of current property taxes.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The contract payments to any person, firm, or corporation employed by the collecting treasurer to assist in the collection of the current property taxes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   All surplus money in a current school tax collection fund shall be invested by the collecting treasurer in any investment authorized by Act No. 20 of the Public Acts of 1943, being sections 129.91 to 129.93 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. The county treasurer and the treasurer of a school district or intermediate school district shall publish, on March 1 of the year after the treasurer first collects the summer property tax levy of a school district or intermediate school district and each year thereafter, an annual report on the status of the fund for the last year ending December 31. The report shall show the total charges, expenses, and year-end surplus.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   Money in the current school tax collection fund shall not be transferred to the general fund of the county, school district, or intermediate school district or made the subject of appropriation by the county, school district, or intermediate school district. Any surplus in a current school tax collection fund shall be used by the county treasurer, school district treasurer, or intermediate school district treasurer to reduce the following costs for the next summer property tax levy of a school district or intermediate school district that is collected by the county treasurer, school district treasurer, or intermediate school district treasurer:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The costs of collection, in excess of fees and charges, incurred or paid pursuant to subsection (4)(b).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The fees and charges imposed pursuant to subsection (4)(g).</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a local school district board claims the existence of an emergency due to extreme financial conditions because of insufficient operating funds or due to a severe classroom shortage, which emergency the local school district claims renders it unable to provide special education programs and services in compliance with section 1751, the local school district board shall apply in writing to the state board before July 1 of the particular school year for approval to provide special education programs or services which do not comply with section 1751. The state board may extend the filing date for good cause.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In its application the local school district board shall demonstrate the need to provide noncomplying special education programs and services and shall include the proposed programs and services it is able to provide and the efforts to be undertaken to alleviate the emergency. If the state board finds an emergency exists in the local school district for the school year, the state board may approve the providing of noncomplying special education programs or services and prescribe conditions for those programs and services.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the state board determines that a local school district is not providing special education programs and services in compliance with section 1751, and the local school district has not obtained prior approval from the state board, the state board shall give the local school district board written notice of the noncompliance. Unless the local school district board submits proof of compliance or of an unforeseen emergency within 30 days after receipt of the notice, the state board shall direct the intermediate school board of which the local school district is constituent to provide complying programs or services. The state board shall direct the intermediate school board to provide only those programs or services which the state board determines the local school district is not providing in compliance with section 1751.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Special education programs or services which the state board directs an intermediate school district to provide shall be funded as if provided by the local school district and the local school district board shall contribute to the intermediate school district the unreimbursed cost of the programs or services.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Beginning in 1995, and subject to section 625b, the board of an intermediate school district may levy ad valorem property taxes for special education purposes under sections 1722 to 1729 at a rate not to exceed 1.75 times the number of mills of those taxes authorized in the intermediate school district in 1993. All or part of the millage levied under this section may be renewed as provided in this article. Approval of the intermediate school electors is not required for the levy under this section of previously authorized mills until that authorization expires.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An intermediate school district that levies a tax for special education operating purposes shall not use proceeds from the tax for any purpose other than special education operating purposes and shall submit to the department of treasury a copy of the audit report from the audit of the intermediate school district conducted under section 622a. If the department of treasury determines from the audit report that the proceeds from the tax have been used for a purpose other than special education operating purposes, as defined under subsection (4), the department of treasury shall notify the intermediate school district of that determination. If the intermediate school district disputes the determination or claims that the situation has been corrected, within 15 days after receipt of the determination the intermediate school district may submit an appeal of the determination to the department of treasury.

The attorney general shall review the report and, if the attorney general considers it appropriate, shall commence or direct the prosecuting attorney for the county in which the violations occurred to commence appropriate proceedings against the intermediate school board or the official or employee. These proceedings shall include at least a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction for the recovery of any public money determined by the audit to have been illegally expended and for the recovery of any public property determined by the audit to have been converted or misappropriated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the attorney general determines from a report filed under subsection (2) that an intermediate school district has misspent tax proceeds as described in subsection (2) and notifies the intermediate school district of this determination, the intermediate school district shall repay to its special education operating fund an amount equal to the amount the department of treasury determined under subsection (2) has been used for a purpose other than special education operating purposes. The intermediate school district shall make this repayment from funds of the intermediate school district that lawfully may be used for making such a repayment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) For the purposes of subsections (2) and (3), the department and the department of treasury, in consultation with intermediate school districts, shall develop and make available to intermediate school districts a definition of special education operating purposes.</div>
