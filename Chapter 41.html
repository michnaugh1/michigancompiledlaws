<P>Sec. 72a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The township board shall provide by resolution for the time and place of its regular meetings, and shall hold not less than 1 regular meeting every 3 months. If a time set for a regular meeting of the township board is a holiday, as designated by the township board, the regular meeting shall be held at the same time and place on the next secular day that is not a holiday.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A special meeting of the township board shall be held at a time fixed by the board at a meeting or when the supervisor considers it necessary. Upon call of the supervisor, the township clerk shall give notice of the time and place of the meeting to each member, either in person or by leaving a written notice at the member's address. A special meeting of the township board shall be called by the township clerk upon receiving a written request for the meeting signed by a majority of the township board members.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The supervisor, if present, shall be the moderator of a regular or special meeting of the township board. If the supervisor is not present, the township board, under the direction of the township clerk, shall elect by voice vote a member of the township board as a moderator of the meeting. The township clerk has the same powers and duties as the moderator until a moderator is chosen.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The township board shall not transact business at a special meeting unless the business was stated in the notice of the meeting. However, if all the members of the board are present at a special meeting, business that might lawfully come before a regular meeting of the board may be transacted at the special meeting.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Subject to subsection (6), if a township has a taxable value, as calculated under section 27a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.27A, of $50,000,000.00 or more, the township board, not more than 21 days after a meeting of the board, shall publish the proceedings of the meeting in a newspaper of general circulation in the township. The publication of a synopsis of the proceedings, prepared by the township clerk and approved by the supervisor, showing the substance of each separate proceeding of the board is a sufficient compliance with the requirements of this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The $50,000,000.00 amount provided for in subsection (5) shall be adjusted as of January 1 of each year, beginning January 1, 1998. The department of treasury shall determine on or before December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 1997, an adjusted amount for the following year. The adjusted amount for each year shall be determined by comparing the consumer price index for the 12-month period ending the preceding October 31 with the corresponding consumer price index of 1 year earlier. The percentage increase or decrease shall then be multiplied by the current adjusted amount. The product shall be rounded up to the nearest multiple of $1,000,000.00 and shall be the new adjusted amount. The department of treasury shall provide the adjusted amount upon request. As used in this section, "consumer price index" means the annual average percentage increase in the Detroit consumer price index for all items as reported by the United States department of labor.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A township board may provide for the acquisition or financing of energy conservation improvements to be made to township facilities or infrastructure and may pay for the improvements or the financing or refunding of the improvements from operating funds of the township or from the savings that result from the energy conservation improvements. Energy conservation improvements may include, but are not limited to, heating, ventilating, or air-conditioning system improvements, fenestration improvements, roof improvements, the installation of any insulation, the installation or repair of heating, ventilating, or air-conditioning controls, entrance or exit way closures, information technology improvements associated with an energy conservation improvement, and municipal utility improvements associated with an energy conservation improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The township board may acquire, finance, or refund 1 or more of the energy conservation improvements described in subsection (1) by installment contract, which may include a lease-purchase agreement described in subsection (5), or may borrow money and issue notes for the purpose of securing funds for the improvements or may enter into contracts in which the cost of the energy conservation improvements is paid from a portion of the savings that result from the energy conservation improvements. These contractual agreements may provide that the cost of the energy conservation improvements are paid only if the energy savings are sufficient to cover their cost. An installment contract, a lease-purchase agreement described in subsection (5), or notes issued pursuant to this subsection shall extend for a period of time not to exceed 20 years from the date of the final completion of the energy conservation improvements or the useful life of the aggregate energy conservation improvements, whichever is less. Notes issued pursuant to this subsection shall be full faith and credit, tax limited obligations of the township, payable from tax levies and the general fund as pledged by the township board. The notes are subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821. A lease-purchase agreement issued pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821, and shall not be a municipal security or a debt as those terms are defined in that act. This subsection does not limit in any manner the borrowing or bonding authority of a township as provided by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Prior to entering into a contract for energy conservation improvements under this section, the township board shall determine the following information and, within 60 days of the completion of the improvements, shall report the following information to the Michigan public service commission: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Name of each facility to which an improvement is made and a description of the energy conservation improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Actual energy consumption during the 12-month period before commencement of the improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Project costs and expenditures, including the total of all lease payments over the duration of the lease-purchase agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Estimated annual energy savings, including projected savings over the duration of the installment contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If energy conservation improvements are made as provided in this section, the township board shall report to the Michigan public service commission, by July 1 of each of the 5 years after the improvements are completed, only the actual annual energy consumption of each facility to which improvements are made. The forms for the reports required by this section shall be furnished by the Michigan public service commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An installment contract described in this section may include a lease-purchase agreement, which may be a multiyear contractual obligation that provides for automatic renewal unless positive action is taken by the legislative body to terminate that contract. Payments under a lease-purchase agreement shall be a current operating expense subject to annual appropriations of funds by the legislative body and shall obligate the legislative body only for those sums payable during the fiscal year of contract execution or any renewal year thereafter. The legislative body may make payments under a lease-purchase agreement from any legally available funds or from a combination of energy or operational savings, capital contributions, future replacement costs avoided, or billable revenue enhancements that result from energy conservation improvements, provided that the legislative body has determined that those funds are sufficient to cover, in aggregate over the full term of the contractual agreement, the cost of the energy conservation improvements. The lease-purchase agreement will terminate immediately and absolutely and without further obligation on the part of the legislative body at the close of the fiscal year in which it was executed or renewed or at such time as appropriated and otherwise unobligated funds are no longer available to satisfy the obligations of the legislative body under the lease-purchase agreement. During the term of the lease-purchase agreement, the legislative body shall be the vested owner of the energy conservation improvements and may grant a security interest in the energy conservation improvements to the provider of the lease-purchase agreement. Upon the termination of the lease-purchase agreement and the satisfaction of the obligations of the legislative body, the provider of the lease-purchase agreement shall release its security interest in the energy conservation improvements.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 95.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    In a township that holds an annual meeting of the electors of the township as provided in section 8, the officers composing the township board are entitled to the salary as determined by resolution adopted by the township board at least 30 days prior to the annual meeting of the township electors. The resolution shall establish the effective date of the salary, which shall be during the next fiscal year. The electors at the subsequent annual meeting of the electors may alter the amount of salary fixed by the resolution. If the electors fail to act on the salary resolution, the officers are entitled to the salary set in the resolution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A trustee may receive, in addition to the annual salary for his or her service to the township, a sum for each meeting of the board actually attended by the trustee, as established by the township board, to be paid upon authorization of the township board. The supervisor, clerk, and treasurer shall receive no additional compensation for attending meetings of the township board. Members of the township board may be reimbursed for reasonable expenses actually incurred on behalf of the township. An official appointed to fill a vacancy of an elective township office shall be entitled to the same compensation as that established for the official who previously held that office. The salary of an elected township official or an official appointed to fill a vacancy shall not be decreased during the official's term of office unless the responsibilities and requirements of that office are diminished and the official consents in writing to the reduction in salary. However, if a township in setting a township supervisor's salary has designated a portion of the supervisor's salary to be paid the supervisor for directly performing the property tax assessing function within the township and the supervisor subsequently fails to perform that function, the salary of the supervisor may be reduced by that portion of the supervisor's salary designated for the direct performance of the property tax assessment function. Nevertheless, that portion of a supervisor's salary designated for nonassessment functions shall not be decreased during the supervisor's term of office without the supervisor's written consent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In a township that, pursuant to section 8, does not hold an annual township meeting and in a charter township created under Act No. 359 of the Public Acts of 1947, as amended, being sections 42.1 to 42.34 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, the salary for officers composing the township board shall be determined by the township board. If a petition is filed within 30 days after the township board votes the salary signed by 10% of the qualified electors of the township requesting that the question be submitted to the electorate, the township board shall call a special election and submit the question of salary to the electors. The vote upon the question of approving the resolution shall be by a ballot which shall be in substantially the following form:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Vote on proposition of approving a resolution of the township board providing a salary of .......... dollars, per annum, to the ........................., in place of all per diem charges for services.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Make a cross in the appropriate square.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   To approve the resolution. Yes [  ]</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   To approve the resolution. No  [  ]"</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If a majority of the electors voting upon the resolution disapprove the resolution, then, effective on the date of the certification of the election results by the board of canvassers, the officer's salary shall revert to the salary for that office in effect before the adoption of the resolution. If a majority of the electors voting upon the resolution approve the resolution, the officer shall receive the salary set forth in the resolution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In place of the procedures in subsections (1), (2), and (3) for determining salaries of elected officials, the township board may by ordinance establish the procedure described in this subsection. The ordinance shall provide as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A local officials compensation commission is created. The commission shall determine the salary of each township elected official. The commission shall consist of 5 members who are registered electors of the township, appointed by the supervisor subject to confirmation by a majority of the members elected and serving on the township board. The terms of office shall be 5 years, except that of the members first appointed, 1 each shall be appointed for terms of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. The first members shall be appointed within 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance. Subsequent members shall be appointed within 30 days after a term expires or a vacancy occurs. Vacancies shall be filled for the remainder of an unexpired term. An officer or employee of a government agency or unit or member of the immediate family of an officer or employee shall not be appointed to the commission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The commission shall determine the salary of each member of the township board, which shall be effective at the beginning of the next fiscal year. The determination of the commission shall be the salary unless the township board by resolution adopted by 2/3 of the members elected to and serving on the board rejects the determination. The determination of the commission shall be effective 30 days following filing of the determination with the township clerk unless rejected by the township board. If the determination is rejected, the existing salary shall prevail. An expense allowance or reimbursement paid to elected officials in addition to salary shall be for expenses incurred in the course of township business and accounted for to the township.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The commission shall meet for not more than 15 session days in each odd numbered year and shall make its determination within 45 calendar days of its first meeting. A majority of the members of the commission constitutes a quorum for conducting the business of the commission. The business that the commission may perform shall be conducted at a public meeting of the commission held in compliance with the open meetings act, Act No. 267 of the Public Acts of 1976, being sections 15.261 to 15.275 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. Public notice of the time, date, and place of the meeting shall be given in the manner required by Act No. 267 of the Public Acts of 1976. The commission shall not take action or make a determination without a concurrence of a majority of the members appointed and serving on the commission. The commission shall elect a chairperson from among its members. As used in this section, "session days" means calendar days on which the commission meets and a quorum is present. The members of the commission shall not receive compensation, but shall be entitled to actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of official duties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The township board may implement the ordinance by resolution including the date for convening the commission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Not more than 60 days after the effective date of the ordinance, a petition for a referendum on the ordinance may be filed with the township clerk containing the signatures of not less than 5% of the registered electors of the township on the effective date of the ordinance in which case the election shall be conducted in the same manner as an election on a resolution under subsection (3). If a petition for referendum is filed, a determination of the commission shall not be effective until the ordinance has been approved by the electors.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The salary of an elected township official shall not be decreased during the official's term of office.</DIV>

The township shall enforce the ordinances and may employ and establish a police department with full power to enforce township ordinances and state laws. If state laws are to be enforced, a township shall have a law enforcement unit or may by resolution appropriate funds and call upon the sheriff of the county in which the township is located, the department of state police, or another law enforcement agency to provide special police protection for the township. The sheriff, department of state police, or other local law enforcement agency shall, if called upon, provide special police protection for the township and enforce local township ordinances to the extent that township funds are appropriated for the enforcement. Special township deputies appointed by the sheriff shall be under the jurisdiction of and solely responsible to the sheriff.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Ordinances enacted may apply to streets, roads, highways, or portions of the township determined by the township board or may be limited to specified platted lands within the township, and with respect to these lands are valid and enforceable whether the roads and streets have been dedicated to public use or not. Township boards of townships enacting ordinances under this section may accept contributions from duly constituted representatives of the platted lands benefited by the ordinances to defray administrative and enforcement costs incident to the enactment of ordinances.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A township may adopt a provision of any state statute for which the maximum period of imprisonment is 93 days or the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.1 to 257.923, by reference in an adopting ordinance, which statute must be clearly identified in the adopting ordinance. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a township shall not enforce any provision adopted by reference for which the maximum period of imprisonment is greater than 93 days. A township may adopt section 625(1)(c) of the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.625, by reference in an adopting ordinance and shall provide that a violation of that ordinance is a misdemeanor punishable by 1 or more of the following:</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whenever the owners of more than 51% of the lineal frontage of lands outside of the corporate limits of any city or village fronting or touching upon any public highway or portion thereof, desire a pavement or sidewalks built thereon, they may file an application for such improvement with the county road commissioners of the county in which such pavement or sidewalk is proposed to be built. No application for the paving of any highway, or portion thereof, shall be considered unless at least 75% of the lands fronting thereon have been subdivided into parcels having a frontage of not more than 300 feet each on such highway or there shall be an average of at least 1 building, including buildings under construction, located along the portion of such highway proposed to be paved for every 300 lineal feet thereof, according to a survey thereof to be made by the commissioners. The eligibility of signers to any application hereby authorized may be determined by their interest of record in the office of the register of deeds or in the probate court of the county in which such lands are situated at the time the petition is presented or by other satisfactory proof of interest presented to the commissioners. Such petition shall be accompanied by a description of the land fronting or touching on the highway owned by each signer and by a certificate of the county treasurer, showing the taxes or special assessments, if any, against such lands which appear delinquent on his books; no name of any signer on the petition shall be considered valid whose land fronting or touching on the highways shows delinquent assessments or taxes on such certificate. Any petition so received by the commissioners or presented to them under the provisions of this act, shall be deemed to confer full authority to cause such work to be done in order that the proper proportion of the expense thereof may be met accordingly. The commissioners shall have all the power of laying out and establishing all such pavements or sidewalks. The words "highway" or "public highway" as used in this act mean any road, street or alley taken over by and under the jurisdiction of the board of county road commissioners.</DIV>

The petition shall not be considered unless it complies with the subdivision and building requirements set forth in section 1 relating to applications by property owners.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A declaration of necessity shall be made by resolution of the board of county road commissioners who shall thereafter hold a public hearing at the township hall upon the declaration of necessity in the same manner as if an application had been filed by property owners as set forth in section 1. After the date of the public hearing on the declaration of necessity, the property owners of 51% or more of the lineal frontage along the proposed improvement may submit within 45 days a petition to the board of county road commissioners requesting that the project be discontinued. The project shall be discontinued if, upon examination, the owners of 51% or more of the lineal frontage along the improvement have signed the petition. If no petition is filed within 45 days, the project shall proceed in the same manner as if inaugurated by property owners.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Notwithstanding sections 19 through 19d, the board of county road commissioners of a county operating under the county road system may provide for the lighting, by artificial means, of roads, highways, and bridges under its jurisdiction, located outside of the limits of incorporated cities and villages. The township board or boards of a township or townships in which county roads, highways, and bridges are located may also provide for the lighting, by artificial means. Boards of county road commissioners and township boards may also provide for the lighting by joint action, and by dividing the expense of the lighting between the county or counties and the township or townships affected as may be determined by joint meeting of the boards. The board of county road commissioners or township board, acting separately or in conjunction with other boards of county road commissioners or with a township board or township boards, may enter into a contract with a person for a period not exceeding 10 years for the lighting upon terms and conditions as may be agreed upon, and may also contract for the extensions of lines or service to furnish the lighting. The boards of county road commissioners may pay from available highway funds under their control and jurisdiction sums required to provide for the extensions and furnish the lighting. If funds are not available, the board of county road commissioners shall submit to the county board of commissioners a statement and budget designating the roads, highways, and bridges to be lighted, and the estimated cost of the lighting. At the next October session of the county board of commissioners, the board shall pass upon the statement and budget, and, if a majority of the county board of commissioners agree, the sum required shall be apportioned among the several townships and cities of the county according to their equalized valuation. The supervisors or other assessing officers in the townships and cities shall levy and apportion the tax so apportioned as provided in this section, to their respective townships and cities. The tax shall be collected and paid to the county treasurer and disbursed by him or her upon orders of the board of county road commissioners, the orders to be signed by the chairperson and countersigned by the clerk of the board. The county board of commissioners shall raise a sum which, together with the other funds available, is sufficient to provide the lighting for which the facilities have, under an existing contract, been previously installed and operated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   With the approval of the director of the state transportation department, boards of county road commissioners and township boards acting together or separately, may, with respect to state trunk line highways and bridges located in whole or in part within their respective counties and townships, provide for the lighting of these highways and bridges by artificial means and may contract in the same manner as for county roads. In such case, the entire expense shall be borne by the boards of county road commissioners or township boards, or by both.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Not more than 75% of the net cost, exclusive of money, materials, and labor that are supplied by a federal agency, of purchasing and laying the mains and fittings of a water supply system shall be paid out of the contingent fund of the township. On resolving to make and install the improvement, the township board shall determine by resolution the net cost and the share of the net cost not exceeding 75% that the contingent fund of the township shall bear. However, no part of the cost of a water supply system acquired or created under sections 1 to 20a shall be levied or collected as a tax or assessment, whether general or special, upon property located in a village or school district or located in a water supply district in the township, including an area of the township served by a water system owned or operated by a city, if the village, school district, or water supply district has a water supply system that was originally acquired and is operated by or for the village, school district, or water supply district without any expense to the township at large. A water supply system, so separately financed and operated, shall not be taken, as to ownership or control, except by due process of law as provided by the general laws of this state. After determining the amount of money to be appropriated at any time from the township's contingent fund for purposes authorized in this section, the township board may set apart from that amount when appropriated a proportionate part of that amount for the benefit of the separately operated water supply system in the same ratio to the whole amount appropriated as the population of the separate district bears to the total population of the township, as determined by the board. This proportionate part shall be applied for the betterment of the separate water supply system as and when authorized by the board. The township board shall prepare and keep on file a map defining the boundaries of a water supply district served by the separately financed and operated water supply system separate from a township water system.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upon the filing of petitions verified both as to signature and ownership, signed by record owners of land to be made into a special assessment district in which an improvement or service specified in section 1 is desired by the owners of the land, the township board may construct and maintain the improvement or provide the service, determine the cost of the improvement or service, and create, define, and establish a special assessment district within all or within and comprising not less than 80% of the area. The cost of the improvement or service shall be levied upon the district. However, the record owners of not less than 51% of the land actually created into the special assessment district by the township board must have signed the petitions. A district established and assessed may be enlarged through a petition, circulated and signed as required for an original district, but covering only the area to be added to create the enlarged district. Benefits of an improvement or service may be extended to the added part, and the entire enlarged district may be assessed for the improvement or service, as provided for an original district. If a service has been instituted and no assessment bonds for the service are outstanding, the service may be discontinued upon petition by owners of 51% of the lands.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 3.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Before commencing an improvement or service authorized by section 1, the township board shall obtain from competent sources maps, plans, and estimates of the proposed improvement or service, shall determine by resolution the cost of the proposed improvement or service, and shall provide for the making of a special assessment upon each parcel of land in the special assessment district by benefits and for the issuing and sale of special assessment bonds in anticipation of the collection of the special assessment taxes. The special assessment bonds shall not be issued before the final confirmation of the assessment roll by the township board. A proceeding relating to the making, levying, and collection of a special assessment authorized by this section and to issuing bonds in anticipation of the collection of the special assessment shall conform, as near as may be, to a proceeding for levying a special assessment and issuing special assessment bonds by a village for a similar improvement or service, as set forth in Act No. 3 of the Public Acts of 1895, as amended, being sections 61.1 to 74.22 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. If the special assessment fund is insufficient to pay the bonds and interest on the bonds when due and the bonds were issued subsequent to April 21, 1927, the township board may advance the amount necessary to pay the bonds and shall be reimbursed from the assessments when collected or by reassessment of the deficiency if necessary. However, as to bonds issued subsequent to July 1, 1951, the township board may, at the time of issuance, pledge the full faith and credit of the township for the payment of the bonds, and if the special assessment fund is insufficient to pay the bonds and interest on the bonds when due, the township board shall advance the amount necessary to pay the bonds and shall be reimbursed from the assessments when collected or by reassessment of the deficiency against the special assessment district, if necessary.</DIV>

As used in this section, "annual township election" means an election held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November every year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The township clerk shall call a special township election, upon the filing with the clerk of a petition signed by 25 registered electors of the district, for the election of the members of the board of public service commissioners to hold office until the first annual township election. At the first annual township election held under this section, 2 commissioners shall be elected for a term of 3 years, 2 commissioners shall be elected for a term of 2 years, and 1 commissioner shall be elected for a term of 1 year.

The provisions of this section do not apply to a waterworks facility constituting only a part of a general township water system. A petition under this subsection, including the circulation and signing of the petition, is subject to section 488 of the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.488. A person who violates a provision of the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.1 to 168.992, applicable to a petition described in this subsection is subject to the penalties prescribed for that violation in the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.1 to 168.992.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A board of public service commissioners may dissolve itself, alone or together with the district, upon satisfaction of all of the following requirements:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The board of public service commissioners shall prepare a financial report of the assets and liabilities of the district. The financial report shall include a description of obligations of the district, an accounting of money held by the district, an appraisal or inventory of other assets of the district, and a description of any encumbrances on assets of the district. The board of public service commissioners shall file a copy of the financial report with the township clerk of the township where the district is located.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The board of public service commissioners shall hold a public hearing on the issue of the dissolution. In addition to satisfying the requirements of the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275, the board of public service commissioners shall publish notice of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the township where the district is located not less than 10 days before the hearing. The notice shall give the time, date, location, and purpose of the hearing and state that a copy of the financial report is available for public inspection at the office of the township clerk.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   After the hearing, the board of public service commissioners shall prepare a plan for the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the district to the township where the district is located. The plan shall not impair the rights of holders of special assessment bonds issued pursuant to section 3 or the rights of property owners served by the waterworks.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The township board of the township where the district is located shall adopt a resolution agreeing to the dissolution of the board of public service commissioners, alone or together with the district, in accordance with the plan under subdivision (c).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   After the township board adopts a resolution under subdivision (d), the board of public service commissioners shall adopt a consistent resolution to dissolve itself, alone or together with the district, in accordance with the plan under subdivision (c).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   As its last act before the effective date of dissolution, a board of public service commissioners shall file its records with the clerk of the township where the district is located, for safekeeping and reference.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An appeal may be taken from the assessment of the supervisor to the board of public service commissioners, which shall act as a board of review and have the same powers and duties and be governed by the same procedures and the same legal consequences as the board of review provided for in the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a village or district is served by a waterworks, water reservoir, or aqueduct to a source of water supply established without expense to the township at large, the works shall not be tapped for the purpose of supplying water outside of the village or district if the tapping would seriously deplete or imperil the water supply or pressure of the village or district. The works shall not be tapped in any case without the consent of the board of public service commissioners. If a village or district is served by a public improvement or service described in section 1 that has been established and is being operated without expense to the township, no part of a tax or assessment shall be levied by the township upon the village or district for the purpose of establishing or operating a similar improvement or facility for other parts of the township.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 4.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Upon receipt of a petition or upon determination of the township board if a petition is not required under section 3, the township board, if it desires to proceed on the improvement, shall cause to be prepared plans describing the improvement and the location of the improvement with an estimate of the cost of the improvement on a fixed or periodic basis, as appropriate. Upon receipt of the plans and estimate, the township board shall order the same to be filed with the township clerk. If the township board desires to proceed with the improvement, the township board shall tentatively declare by resolution its intention to make the improvement and tentatively designate the special assessment district against which the cost of the improvement or a designated part of the improvement is to be assessed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The township board shall fix a time and place to meet and hear any objections to the petition, if a petition is required, to the improvement, and to the special assessment district, and shall cause notice of the hearing to be given as provided in section 4a. The notice shall state that the plans and estimates are on file with the township clerk for public examination and shall contain a description of the proposed special assessment district. If periodic redeterminations of cost will be necessary without a change in the special assessment district, the notice shall state that such redeterminations may be made without further notice to record owners or parties in interest in the property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   At the hearing, or any adjournment of the hearing which may be without further notice, the township board shall hear any objections to the petition, if a petition is required, to the improvement, and to the special assessment district. The township board may revise, correct, amend, or change the plans, estimate of cost, or special assessment district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Property shall not be added to the district unless notice is given as provided in section 4a, or by personal service upon the record owners of the property in the entire proposed special assessment district, and a hearing afforded to the record owners. If a petition is required because property is added to the special assessment district which makes the original petition insufficient, then a supplemental petition shall be filed containing sufficient additional signatures of record owners. If the nature of the improvement to be made is such that a periodic redetermination of costs will be necessary without a change in the special assessment district boundaries, the township board shall include in its estimate of costs any projected incremental increases. If at any time during the term of the special assessment district an actual incremental cost increase exceeds the estimate therefor by 10% or more, notice shall be given as provided in section 4a and a hearing afforded to the record owners of property to be assessed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Railroad companies shall file in writing with the secretary of state the name and post office address of the person upon whom may be served notice of any proceedings under this act. After the name and address has been filed, notice in addition to the notice by publication shall be given to the person by registered mail, or personally, within 5 days after the first publication of the notice. An affidavit of the service shall be filed by the township board with the proof of publication of the notice.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 4a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If special assessments are made against property, notice of hearings in the special assessment proceedings shall be given as provided in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Notice of hearings in special assessment proceedings shall be given to each record owner of, or party in interest in, property to be assessed whose name appears upon the last township tax assessment records by first-class mail addressed to the record owner or party in interest at the address shown on the tax records, at least 10 days before the date of the hearing. The last township tax assessment records means the last assessment roll for ad valorem tax purposes that was reviewed by the township board of review, as supplemented by any subsequent changes in the names or the addresses of the owners or parties listed on that roll. If a record owner's name does not appear on the township tax assessment records, then notice shall be given by first-class mail addressed to the record owner at the address shown by the records of the county register of deeds at least 10 days before the date of the hearing. Notice shall also be published twice before the hearing in a newspaper circulating in the township. The first publication shall be at least 10 days before the date of the hearing. If a published notice includes a list of the property identification numbers of the property to be assessed, that list may provide either the individual property identification number for each parcel of property to be assessed or 1 or more sequential sets of property identification numbers, which include each parcel of property to be assessed. If a published notice includes a list of the property identification numbers of the property to be assessed, that published notice shall also include either a map depicting the area of the proposed special assessment district or a written description of the proposed special assessment district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a person whose name and correct address do not appear upon the last township tax assessment records claims an interest in real property, that person shall immediately file his or her name and address with the township supervisor. This filing is effective only for the purpose of establishing a record of the names and addresses of those persons entitled to notice of hearings in special assessment proceedings. The supervisor shall immediately enter on the tax assessment records any changes in the names and addresses of record owners or parties in interest filed with the supervisor and at all times shall keep the tax assessment records current, complete, and available for public inspection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A township officer required to give notice of a hearing in special assessment proceedings may rely upon the last township tax assessment records in giving notice of the hearing by mail. The method of giving notice by mail as provided in this section is declared to be the method that is reasonably certain to inform those to be assessed of the special assessment proceedings.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Failure to give notice as required in this section shall not invalidate an entire assessment roll, but only the assessment on property affected by the lack of notice. A special assessment shall not be declared invalid as to any property if the owner or the party in interest of that property actually received notice, waived notice, or paid any part of the assessment. If an assessment is declared void by court decree or judgment, a reassessment against the property may be made.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A special assessment hearing held before June 5, 1974 is validated, insofar as any notice of hearing is concerned, if notice was given by mail to the owners or parties in interest whose names appeared at the time of mailing on the last township tax assessment records. Any such special assessment hearing is validated as to any owner or party in interest who actually received notice of hearing, waived the notice, or paid any part of the special assessment.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If, after the hearing provided for in section 4, the township board desires to proceed with the improvement, the township board shall approve or determine by resolution all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The completion of the improvement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The plans and estimate of cost as originally presented or as revised, corrected, amended, or changed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The sufficiency of the petition for the improvement if a petition is required. After this determination, the sufficiency of the petition is not subject to attack except in an action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days after the adoption of the resolution determining the sufficiency of the petition. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The special assessment district including the term of the special assessment district's existence. If the nature of the improvement to be made is such that a periodic redetermination of cost will be necessary without a change in the special assessment district boundaries, the township board shall state that in the resolution and shall set the dates when the redeterminations shall be made. After finally determining the special assessment district, the township board shall direct the supervisor to make a special assessment roll in which are entered and described all the parcels of land to be assessed, with the names of the respective record owners of each parcel, if known, and the total amount to be assessed against each parcel of land, which amount shall be the relative portion of the whole sum to be levied against all parcels of land in the special assessment district as the benefit to the parcel of land bears to the total benefit to all parcels of land in the special assessment district. When the supervisor completes the assessment roll, the supervisor shall affix to the roll his or her certificate stating that the roll was made pursuant to a resolution of the township board adopted on a specified date, and that in making the assessment roll the supervisor, according to his or her best judgment, has conformed in all respects to the directions contained in the resolution and the statutes of this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   After December 31, 1998, an ad valorem special assessment levied under this act shall be levied on the taxable value of the property assessed. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the levy of an ad valorem special assessment on the property's taxable value is found to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the levy of the ad valorem special assessment shall be levied on the property's state equalized value.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   As used in this section and section 15b, "taxable value" means that value determined under section 27a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.27a.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The township board of a township, or the township boards of adjoining townships acting jointly, whether or not the townships are located in the same county, may purchase police and fire motor vehicles, apparatus, equipment, and housing and for that purpose may provide by resolution for the appropriation of general or contingent funds. Before January 1, 1999, the appropriation for fire motor vehicles, apparatus, equipment, and housing in a 1-year period must not exceed 10 mills of the assessed valuation of the area in their respective townships for which fire protection is to be furnished. After December 31, 1998, the appropriation for fire motor vehicles, apparatus, equipment, and housing in a 1-year period must not exceed 10 mills of the taxable value of the area in their respective townships for which fire protection is to be furnished. Before January 1, 1999, the appropriation for police motor vehicles, apparatus, equipment, and housing in a 1-year period must not exceed 10 mills of the assessed valuation of the area in their respective townships for which police protection is to be furnished. After December 31, 1998, the appropriation for police motor vehicles, apparatus, equipment, and housing in a 1-year period must not exceed 10 mills of the taxable value of the area in their respective townships for which police protection is to be furnished.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The township board of a township, or the township boards of adjoining townships acting jointly, whether or not the townships are located in the same county, may provide annually by resolution for the appropriation of general or contingent funds for maintenance and operation of police and fire departments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The township board, or the township boards of adjoining townships acting jointly, may provide that the sums prescribed in subsection (2) for purchasing and housing equipment, for the operation of the equipment, or both, may be defrayed by special assessment on the lands and premises in the township or townships to be benefited, except, beginning in 2002, lands and premises exempt from the collection of taxes under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, and may issue bonds in anticipation of the collection of these special assessments. The question of raising money by special assessment may be submitted to the electors of the township or townships by the township board, or township boards acting jointly, at a general election or special election called for that purpose by the township board or township boards. The question of raising money by special assessment must be submitted by the township board, or township boards acting jointly, if in the affected township, or in each of the affected townships, the owners of 10% of the land to be made into a special assessment district petition the township board or boards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a special assessment district is proposed under subsection (3), the township board, or township boards acting jointly, shall estimate the cost and expenses of the police and fire motor vehicles, apparatus, equipment, and housing and police and fire protection, and fix a day for a hearing on the estimate and on the question of creating a special assessment district and defraying the expenses of the special assessment district by special assessment on the property to be especially benefited, except, beginning in 2002, property exempt from the collection of taxes under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155. The hearing must be a public meeting held in compliance with the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275. Public notice of the time, date, and place of the meeting must be given in the manner required by the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275. In addition, the township board, or township boards acting jointly, shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed district a notice stating the time, place, and purpose of the meeting. If there is not a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed district, notices must be posted in not less than 3 of the most public places in the proposed district. This notice shall be published or posted not less than 5 days before the hearing. On the day appointed for the hearing, the township board, or township boards acting jointly, shall be in session to hear objections that may be offered against the estimate and the creation of the special assessment district. Before January 1, 1999, if the township board, or township boards acting jointly, determine to create a special assessment district, they shall determine the boundaries by resolution, determine the amount of the special assessment levy, and direct the supervisor or supervisors to spread the assessment levy on all of the lands and premises in the district that are to be especially benefited by the police and fire protection, according to benefits received, except, beginning in 2002, lands and premises exempt from the collection of taxes under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, to defray the expenses of police and fire protection. After December 31, 1998, if the township board, or township boards acting jointly, determine to create a special assessment district, they shall determine the boundaries by resolution, determine the amount of the special assessment levy, and direct the supervisor or supervisors to spread the assessment levy on the taxable value of all of the lands and premises in the district that are to be especially benefited by the police and fire protection, according to benefits received, except, beginning in 2002, lands and premises exempt from the collection of taxes under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, to defray the expenses of police and fire protection. The township board, or township boards acting jointly, shall hold a hearing on objections to the distribution of the special assessment levy. This hearing must be held in the same manner and with the same notice as provided in this section. The township board, or township boards acting jointly, shall annually determine the amount to be assessed in the district for police and fire protection, shall direct the supervisor or supervisors to distribute the special assessment levy, and shall hold a hearing on the estimated costs and expenses of police and fire protection and on the distribution of the levy. The assessment may be made either in a special assessment roll or in a column provided in the regular tax roll. The assessment must be distributed and must become due and be collected at the same time as other township taxes are assessed, levied, and collected, and must be returned in the same manner for nonpayment. If a township has a July property tax levy, not more than 2 mills of the assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the July levy. If the collections received from the special assessment levied to defray the cost or portion intended to be defrayed for police and fire protection are, at any time, insufficient to meet the obligations or expenses incurred for the maintenance and operation of the police and fire departments, the township board of the township, or township boards acting jointly, may, by resolution, authorize the transfer or loan of sufficient money from the general fund of the township or townships, to the special assessment police and fire department fund. This money must be repaid to the general fund of the township or townships out of special assessment funds when collected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The powers granted by this act with respect to police and fire protection may be exercised with respect to police protection alone, fire protection alone, or police and fire protection in combination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) After December 31, 1998, an ad valorem special assessment levied under this act must be levied on the taxable value of the property assessed. After December 31, 2018, a special assessment levied under this act must be spread on the taxable value of the property assessed based on the special benefit provided to the property assessed and may not be based on police and fire protection provided in a prior year to assessed property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A special assessment imposed under this act must be levied on all properties within the special assessment district established pursuant to this act other than properties exempt from the collection of taxes under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this section, "taxable value" means that value determined under section 27a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.27a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the levy of an ad valorem special assessment on the property's taxable value is found to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the levy of the ad valorem special assessment must be levied on the property's state equalized value.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Bonds issued under this act are subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</div>
