</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>119.4 Permissive charter provisions.</B><P>Sec. 4.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Each district incorporated under the provisions of this act may provide in its charter for 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For annually levying and collecting taxes in a sum not to exceed 1/2 of 1% of the assessed value of all real and personal property in the district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For borrowing money on the credit of the district in a sum not to exceed 2% of the assessed value of all real and personal property in the district for the purpose of acquiring, owning, purchasing, constructing, maintaining, or operating parks or public utilities, for supplying sewage disposal, drainage, water, or transportation, or any combination of these. A district may borrow money and issue bonds for any of the purposes described in this subdivision that will impose no liability upon the district but may be paid and secured only by special assessment levied against each parcel for the particular public improvement and for the payment of the bonds that are issued. A district incorporated under the provisions of this act, may, for the purpose of acquiring, owning, purchasing, constructing, or operating any public utility described in this subdivision, issue mortgage bonds that may be issued beyond the general limit of bonded indebtedness prescribed by this act. A mortgage bond issued beyond the general limits of bonded indebtedness shall not impose any liability upon the district but shall be secured only upon the property and revenues of the public utility, including the franchise, stating the terms upon which, in case of foreclosure, the purchaser may operate the public utility, which franchise shall in no case extend for a longer period than 20 years from the date of the sale of the utility and franchise on foreclosure. A mortgage bond shall be sold for not less than par, bear interest at a rate not in excess of 6%, and the total amount shall not exceed 60% of the original cost of the utility. The charter of any district shall provide for the creation of a sinking fund by setting aside a percentage of the gross or net earnings of the public utility as may be deemed sufficient for the payment of the mortgage bonds at maturity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For a lien on any property and for taxes for the payment of any bonds issued or for the cost and expense of making any improvement described in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) For laying and collecting rents, tolls and excises.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) For a special assessment district to provide for the cost and expense of any park or public utility, or combination of a park and public utility, as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) For the purchase or condemnation of the franchises, if any exist, and of the property used in the operation of companies or individuals engaged in or operating public utilities for supplying sewage disposal, drainage, water, or transportation, or any combination of these. Each district may in its charter provide that it may make a contract upon the terms, including terms of present or deferred payment and upon the conditions and in the manner as the district may consider proper, to purchase, operate, and maintain any existing public utility property for supplying sewage disposal, drainage, water, or transportation, or any combination of these within or without its limits. If without its limits, the purchase must be incidental to the operation and maintenance of the public utility. A contract shall not bind the district unless the proposition on the contract shall receive the affirmative vote of 3/5 of the electors voting on the proposition at a regular or special election. In the event of any such purchase, the charter amendment and the contract to purchase shall provide for the creation of a sinking fund, into which shall be paid from time to time, from the earnings of the utility, sums sufficient to insure the payment of the purchase price and the performance of the obligations of the contract to the end that the entire cost of the public utility shall eventually be paid from its earnings. The powers in this subdivision are in addition to the other powers provided for in this act, and the exercise of these powers shall not impair or affect the right to exercise any other powers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) For the purchase, gift, or condemnation of private property for any public use or purpose provided for and within the scope of its power. If by condemnation, the provisions of 1911 PA 149, MCL 213.21 to 213.25, or other appropriate provisions may be adopted and used for the purpose of instituting and prosecuting condemnation proceedings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) For the initiative and referendum on all matters within the scope of its powers. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) For altering, amending, or repealing any charter affecting the district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) For the enforcement of all local, police, sanitary, and other regulations as are not in conflict with the general laws of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) For a system of civil service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) For the exercise of all district powers in the management and control of district property and in the administration of metropolitan district government, whether the powers are expressly enumerated or not. For any act to advance the interest of the district and the good government and prosperity of the district and to pass all laws and ordinances relating to its concerns subject to the constitution and general laws of this state. The power to acquire a rapid transit system is expressly conferred by this act, which may consist of a tunnel, subway, surface, or elevated system, or any combination of these. A rapid transit system shall be considered to be transportation within the meaning of this act and the provisions relating to other public utilities shall also apply. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) A revenue bond issued under this act is subject to the revenue bond act of 1933, 1933 PA 94, MCL 141.101 to 141.140. All bonds issued under this act, other than revenue bonds, are subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Proceedings for the incorporation of metropolitan districts shall be originated as follows: Any city, village or township may, by a resolution adopted by its legislative body, have prepared a description in general terms of the district proposed to be included in a metropolitan district. Each city, village or township desiring to become a part of said district shall thereupon by appropriate resolution of its legislative body indicate its desire to become a part of same.

In said resolution or any subsequent resolution the legislative body of each city, village or township shall designate a person as its representative on a charter commission: Provided, Any city now or hereafter having a population of 50,000 or more inhabitants as determined by the last federal decennial census or by any federal decennial census hereafter taken shall for the first 200,000 population be entitled to an additional charter commissioner for each additional 50,000 population or major fraction thereof, and for all population above 200,000, an additional commissioner for each additional 100,000 population or major fraction thereof. Said commission shall thereupon meet upon written call of any of its members at a time and place to be designated in said notice and elect a president, a vice-president, a secretary and a treasurer and such other officers as it shall deem necessary. The commission shall thereupon prepare a budget of the expenses to be incurred therewith and shall apportion same to each city, village or township upon the basis that the total assessed valuation each city, village or township bears to the whole assessment of said area. Each city, village or township shall pay its representative or representatives the sum of $5.00 per day for each day of actual attendance at meetings of said commission: Provided, The total sum so paid each commissioner shall not exceed the sum of $500.00.

The verification shall state that the petitions were circulated at the request of and pursuant to the directions of the association, organization, person, or persons desiring the amendment. The verification shall also state that the signatures were obtained by the persons verifying the petition, that the signatures are the signatures of the persons purporting to sign the petition, and that each of them signed in his or her presence and that the person verifying the petition has good reason to believe and does believe that the signers obtained are duly qualified and registered electors of the district and are the identical persons their signatures purport to be. Within 14 days from the date of the receipt of any initiatory petition, the secretary or clerk shall check over the names on the petition with the registration rolls of the territory affected or in some other proper manner determine whether the petitioners are duly qualified and registered voters of the district whose charter is to be affected by the amendment.

If he or she finds that there are less than the required number, he or she shall report that fact to the legislative body of the district and no further action upon the petitions shall be had. If the petition conforms to this act, the legislative body of the metropolitan district shall submit the ballot question to the metropolitan district electors as provided in section 389 of the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.389. Other proposals, whether initiated by petition as provided in this section, or proposed by the legislative body, within the times respectively within this act provided, may be submitted to the metropolitan district electors as provided in section 389 of the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.389.</div>
