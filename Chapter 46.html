</P>
<P>Sec. 3.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A majority of the members of the county board of commissioners of a county constitutes a quorum for the transaction of the ordinary business of the county.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The county board of commissioners of a county shall act by the votes of a majority of the members present. However, the final passage or adoption of a measure or resolution or the allowance of a claim against the county shall be determined by a majority of the members elected and serving. The county board of commissioners may require in its bylaws that the votes of 2/3 of the members present or a majority of the members elected and serving, whichever is greater, are required on final passage or adoption of a nonagenda item. The voting requirements of this subsection do not apply if section 11 or any other provision of law imposes a higher voting requirement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   To take the yeas and nays on a question to be voted upon by the county board of commissioners of a county, an electrical roll call system may be used.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The county board of commissioners of a county shall elect 1 member as chairperson and 1 member as vice-chairperson. The chairperson shall be elected each odd numbered year for a 2-year term, unless the county board of commissioners provides by resolution that the chairperson shall be elected annually for a 1-year term. The vice-chairperson shall be elected annually for a 1-year term. The election of a chairperson or vice-chairperson shall take place at the first meeting of the county board of commissioners in a year in which a chairperson or vice-chairperson, respectively, is to be elected. The term of a chairperson or vice-chairperson shall begin upon his or her election. A resolution providing for a 1-year term for the chairperson does not shorten the term of office of a sitting chairperson elected for a 2-year term.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The chairperson shall preside at a meeting of the board, but if the chairperson is absent from a meeting, the vice-chairperson shall preside. A chairperson may administer an oath to a person concerning a matter submitted to the county board of commissioners or connected with the discharge of its duties, may issue subpoenas for witnesses, and may compel the attendance of a witness in the same manner as a court of law. The county board of commissioners may designate 1 member to affix his or her signature to contracts, bonds, and other documents requiring the signature of the chairperson, if the chairperson is unable to so do because of illness or other exigency which, in the opinion of the board, prevents the chairperson from performing the functions of the office.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A member of the county board of commissioners of a county, while a member of the board, is not eligible for election to any other county office or position, the election of which is within the jurisdiction of the county board of commissioners.</DIV>

The repair of the courthouse, jail, and all other public buildings and public offices of the county is hereby declared to be a current county operating expense for which the foregoing provisions are not to be considered as the exclusive means of financing; the county board of commissioners may authorize the use of any county collections not raised by taxation and under their control for current county operating expenses, for the repair of public buildings owned by the county. The amount of money spent for the repair of county buildings in any 1 fiscal year from funds not raised by taxation and under control of the county board of commissioners for current operating expenses, shall not exceed the total amount of such money collected in that year, except as otherwise provided by law unless submitted to the electors of the county and approved by a majority of those voting thereon.</DIV>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>46.11 Powers of county board of commissioners.</B><P>Sec. 11.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>A county board of commissioners, at a lawfully held meeting, may do 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Purchase or lease for a term not to exceed 20 years, real estate necessary for the site of a courthouse, jail, clerk's office, or other county building in that county.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Determine the site of, remove, or designate a new site for a county building. The exercise of the authority granted by this subdivision is subject to any requirement of law that the building be located at the county seat.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Authorize the sale or lease of real estate belonging to the county, and prescribe the manner in which a conveyance of the real estate is to be executed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Erect the necessary buildings for jails, clerks' offices, and other county buildings, and prescribe the time and manner of erecting them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Borrow or raise by tax upon the county those funds authorized by law. The exercise of the authority granted by this subdivision is subject to any voting requirement provided by the law authorizing the borrowing or tax if different from the voting requirement under section 3.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Provide for the repayment of a loan made by the board, by tax upon the county. The loan must be repaid within 15 years after the date of the loan, except that a loan to erect a county building for a public function must be repaid within 30 years after the date of the loan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Prescribe and fix the salaries and compensation of employees of the county if not fixed by law and, except in a county having a board of county auditors, adjust claims against the county. The sum allowed in the adjustment of a claim is subject to appeal as provided by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Direct and provide for the raising of money necessary to defray the current expenses and charges of the county and the necessary charges incident to or arising from the execution of the board's lawful authority, subject to the limitations prescribed in this act. The county board of commissioners may borrow in a year, in anticipation of the levy or collection of taxes for the year, a sum of money, not exceeding 50% of the tax to be levied or collected for the general fund of the county, necessary to defray current expenses of the county. The money borrowed must be repaid from the tax when levied and collected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Authorize the making of a new tax roll.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) By majority vote of the members of the county board of commissioners elected and serving, pass ordinances that relate to county affairs and do not contravene the general laws of this state or interfere with the local affairs of a township, city, or village within the limits of the county, and pursuant to section 10b provide suitable sanctions for the violation of those ordinances. The board may change the limits of a city, village, or school district within the county as provided by law. If there is not a general law governing the subject, or if a change cannot be made pursuant to a general law, the board may change the limits of the village upon petition of at least 10% of the resident taxpayers. An ordinance or act of incorporation provided in this subdivision takes effect when notice of the adoption is published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. The clerk of the county board of commissioners shall engross each ordinance or act, and it shall be signed by the chairperson of the county board of commissioners and certified by the clerk of the county board of commissioners. If, within 50 days after the county board of commissioners adopts an ordinance or act, a petition signed by not less than 20% of the electors residing in the district to be affected by the ordinance or act is filed with the county clerk asking that the ordinance or act be submitted to electors of the district to be affected by the ordinance or act for approval or rejection, then the ordinance or act does not take effect until it is approved by a majority of the electors of the district affected voting on that issue at a regular or special election called for that purpose. The county board of commissioners shall provide the manner of submitting the ordinance or act to the electors for their approval and of determining the result of the election.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) Require a county officer whose salary or compensation is paid by the county to make a report under oath to the county board of commissioners on any subject connected with the duties of that office and require the officer to give a bond reasonable or necessary for the faithful performance of the duties of the office. An officer who neglects or refuses either to make a report or give a bond within a reasonable time after being required to do so may be removed from office by the board by a vote of 2/3 of the members elected or appointed, and the office declared vacant. The board may fill the vacancy for the unexpired portion of the term for which the officer was elected or appointed. If an election occurs before the expiration of the unexpired term, and if the office is elective, the vacancy must be filled at that election. The board shall give reasonable notice of the election to fill the vacancy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) Represent the county and have the care and management of the property and business of the county if other provisions are not made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) Establish rules and regulations in reference to the management of the interest and business concerns of the county as the board considers necessary and proper in all matters not especially provided for in this act or under the laws of this state. The county board of commissioners shall not audit or allow a claim, including a bill or charge, against the county unless the claim has been filed with the county clerk of the county before the fourth day of a regular meeting of the board, or before the second day of an adjourned or other meeting, the claim is contracted by the board during the session of the board or the claim is for mileage and per diem of the members of the board. The county clerk shall keep a book of all claims in the order in which the claims are presented, giving the name of each claimant and the amount and date of presentation of each claim. The book, after the time prescribed for the presentation of claims, must be delivered to the chairperson for the use of the board. At the October session, the board, by a vote of 2/3 of the members, may receive and allow accounts that have wholly accrued during the session.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) Subject to subdivision (o), remove an officer or agent appointed by the board if, in the board's opinion, the officer or agent is incompetent to execute properly the duties of the office or if, on charges and evidence, the board is satisfied that the officer or agent is guilty of official misconduct, or habitual or willful neglect of duty, and if the misconduct or neglect is a sufficient cause for removal. However, an officer or agent shall not be removed for that misconduct or neglect unless charges of misconduct or neglect are presented to the county board of commissioners or the chairperson of the county board of commissioners, notice of the hearing, with a copy of the charges, is delivered to the officer or agent, and a full opportunity is given the officer or agent to be heard, either in person or by counsel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(o) If the county has an appointed county manager or other appointed chief administrative officer or a county controller, the county board of commissioners may enter into an employment contract with that officer. The term of the employment contract may extend beyond the terms of the members of the county board of commissioners. The term of the employment contract must be 3 years or less, unless the employment contract is entered into on or after August 1 of an even-numbered year, in which case the term of the employment contract must be 1 year or less. However, in a county organized under 1966 PA 293, MCL 45.501 to 45.521, with an appointed chief administrative officer, an employment contract with the appointed chief administrative officer must be for the term provided by section 11a of 1966 PA 293, MCL 45.511a. An employment contract under this subdivision must be in writing and must specify the compensation to be paid to the officer, any procedure for changing the compensation, any fringe benefits, and any other conditions of employment. If the officer serves at the pleasure of the county board of commissioners, the contract must so state and may provide for severance pay or other benefits in the event the employment of the officer is terminated at the pleasure of the county board of commissioners.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(p) Establish rules consistent with the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275, for the manner of proceeding before the board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(q) Acquire by exchange land needed for county purposes, including the purchase of land to be used in exchange for other land of approximate equal value owned by the federal government and needed for county purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(r) Grant or loan money to a nonprofit corporation organized for the purpose of providing loans for private sector economic development initiatives. A grant or loan under this subdivision must not be derived from ad valorem taxes except for ad valorem taxes approved by a vote of the people for economic development. The county shall establish an application process for proposals to receive a grant or loan under this subdivision. The awarding of a grant or loan under this subdivision must be made at a public hearing of the county board of commissioners. The grant or loan contract must require a report to the county board of commissioners regarding the activities of the recipient and the degree to which the recipient has met the stated public purpose of the funding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(s) By majority vote of the members of the county board of commissioners elected and serving in a county with an appointed board of county road commissioners, pass a resolution that transfers the powers, duties, and functions that are otherwise provided by law for the appointed board of county road commissioners of that county to the county board of commissioners. The resolution is subject to the requirement in section 6(9) of chapter IV of 1909 PA 283, MCL 224.6. The appointed board of county road commissioners of that county is dissolved on the date specified in the resolution adopted under this subdivision, and the county board of commissioners is authorized to receive and expend funds as allowed under 1951 PA 51, MCL 247.651 to 247.675. If the powers, duties, and functions of the board of county road commissioners of a county are transferred to the county board of commissioners of that county under this subdivision and the powers and duties of the office of county drain commissioner of that county had previously been transferred to the board of county road commissioners as provided in section 21(3) of the drain code of 1956, 1956 PA 40, MCL 280.21, then the county board of commissioners of that county shall reestablish, by resolution, the office of county drain commissioner as an elected office. The resolution reestablishing the office of county drain commissioner must provide for the appointment of an acting county drain commissioner for that county who shall hold office until the next general election at which a county drain commissioner will be elected as provided in chapter X of the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.191 to 168.211.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(t) By majority vote of the members of the county board of commissioners elected and serving in a county with an elected board of county road commissioners, pass a resolution to submit to the qualified and registered electors of the county at the next regular election to be held in the county the question of transferring the powers, duties, and functions of the elected board of county road commissioners of that county to the county board of commissioners. The resolution is subject to the requirement in section 6(9) of chapter IV of 1909 PA 283, MCL 224.6. If a majority of the qualified and registered electors of the county voting on the question vote in favor of transferring the powers, duties, and functions of the elected board of county road commissioners of that county to the county board of commissioners, the elected board of county road commissioners of that county is dissolved and the county board of commissioners is authorized to receive and expend funds as allowed under 1951 PA 51, MCL 247.651 to 247.675. If the powers, duties, and functions of the board of county road commissioners of a county are transferred to the county board of commissioners of that county under this subdivision and the powers and duties of the office of county drain commissioner of that county had previously been transferred to the board of county road commissioners as provided in section 21(3) of the drain code of 1956, 1956 PA 40, MCL 280.21, then the county board of commissioners of that county shall reestablish, by resolution, the office of county drain commissioner as an elected office. The resolution reestablishing the office of county drain commissioner must provide for the appointment of an acting county drain commissioner for that county who shall hold office until the next general election at which a county drain commissioner will be elected as provided in chapter X of the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.191 to 168.211.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(u) If, after a board of county road commissioners is dissolved as provided in subdivision (s) or (t), the county board of commissioners for a county determines that a board of county road commissioners would provide a cost savings to the county residents and would better meet the needs of the county residents, the county board of commissioners for that county may do either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) By majority vote of the members of the county board of commissioners, adopt a county road system with a board of county road commissioners as provided in chapter IV of 1909 PA 283, MCL 224.1 to 224.32.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) By majority vote of the members of the county board of commissioners, submit the question of adopting a county road system with a board of county road commissioners to a vote of the electors of the county as provided in chapter IV of 1909 PA 283, MCL 224.1 to 224.32.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Loan money to a township within the county for the purpose of funding a road construction project or providing matching funds for a joint project between the county and the township. A loan granted under this subdivision must not exceed a term of 10 years.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A county board of commissioners may provide by resolution for the acquisition or financing of energy conservation improvements to be made to county facilities or infrastructure and may pay for the improvements or the financing or refunding of the improvements from the general fund of the county or from the savings that result from the energy conservation improvements. Energy conservation improvements may include, but are not limited to, heating, ventilating, or air-conditioning system improvements, fenestration improvements, roof improvements, the installation of any insulation, the installation or repair of heating, ventilating, or air-conditioning controls, entrance or exit way closures, information technology improvements associated with an energy conservation improvement, and municipal utility improvements associated with an energy conservation improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The county board of commissioners of a county may acquire, finance, or refund 1 or more of the energy conservation improvements described in subsection (1) by installment contract, which may include a lease-purchase agreement described in subsection (5), or may borrow money and issue notes for the purpose of securing funds for the improvements or may enter into contracts in which the cost of the energy conservation improvements is paid from a portion of the savings that result from the energy conservation improvements. These contractual agreements may provide that the cost of the energy conservation improvements are paid only if the energy savings are sufficient to cover their cost. An installment contract, a lease-purchase agreement described in subsection (5), or notes issued pursuant to this subsection shall extend for a period of time not to exceed 20 years from the date of the final completion of the energy conservation improvements or the useful life of the aggregate energy conservation improvements, whichever is less. Notes issued pursuant to this subsection shall be full faith and credit, tax limited obligations of the county, payable from tax levies and the general fund as pledged by the county board of commissioners of the county. The notes are subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821. A lease-purchase agreement issued pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821, and shall not be a municipal security or a debt as those terms are defined in that act. This subsection does not limit in any manner the borrowing or bonding authority of a county as provided by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Prior to entering into a contract for energy conservation improvements under this section, the county board of commissioners shall determine the following information and, within 60 days of the completion of the improvements, shall report the following information to the department of treasury: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Name of each facility to which an improvement is made and a description of the energy conservation improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Actual energy consumption during the 12-month period before commencement of the improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Project costs and expenditures, including the total of all lease payments over the duration of the lease-purchase agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Estimated annual energy savings, including projected savings over the duration of the installment contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If energy conservation improvements are made as provided in this section, the county board of commissioners shall report to the department of treasury, by July 1 of each of the 5 years after the improvements are completed, only the actual annual energy consumption of each facility to which improvements are made. The forms for the reports required by this section shall be furnished by the department of treasury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An installment contract described in this section may include a lease-purchase agreement, which may be a multiyear contractual obligation that provides for automatic renewal unless positive action is taken by the legislative body to terminate that contract. Payments under a lease-purchase agreement shall be a current operating expense subject to annual appropriations of funds by the legislative body and shall obligate the legislative body only for those sums payable during the fiscal year of contract execution or any renewal year thereafter. The legislative body may make payments under a lease-purchase agreement from any legally available funds or from a combination of energy or operational savings, capital contributions, future replacement costs avoided, or billable revenue enhancements that result from energy conservation improvements, provided that the legislative body has determined that those funds are sufficient to cover, in aggregate over the full term of the contractual agreement, the cost of the energy conservation improvements. The lease-purchase agreement will terminate immediately and absolutely and without further obligation on the part of the legislative body at the close of the fiscal year in which it was executed or renewed or at such time as appropriated and otherwise unobligated funds are no longer available to satisfy the obligations of the legislative body under the lease-purchase agreement. During the term of the lease-purchase agreement, the legislative body shall be the vested owner of the energy conservation improvements and may grant a security interest in the energy conservation improvements to the provider of the lease-purchase agreement. Upon the termination of the lease-purchase agreement and the satisfaction of the obligations of the legislative body, the provider of the lease-purchase agreement shall release its security interest in the energy conservation improvements.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to subsection (34), a county board of commissioners at a lawfully held meeting may do 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Provide group life, health, accident and hospitalization, and disability coverage for a county employee, a retired employee, or an employee of an office, board, or department of the county, including the board of county road commissioners, and a dependent of an employee, either with or without cost participation by the employee, and appropriate the necessary money for the insurance. For a county with 100 employees or more, the county may under this subsection self-insure for health, accident and hospitalization, and group disability coverage for a county employee, a retired employee, or an employee of an office, board, or department of the county, including the board of county road commissioners, and a dependent of an employee, either with or without cost participation by the employee, and appropriate the necessary funds.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Adopt and establish a plan by which the county purchases or participates in the cost of an endowment policy or retirement annuity for a county employee or an employee of an office, board, or department of the county, including the board of county road commissioners, to provide monthly pension or retirement benefits for each employee 60 years of age or older in an amount not to exceed $150.00 per month or 2% of the average monthly earnings of the employee for 5 years immediately before retirement times the years of service of the employee, whichever is the lesser amount. As an option, a county board of commissioners may adopt and establish a plan by which the county pays pension or retirement benefits to a county employee or an employee of an office, board, or department of the county, including the board of county road commissioners, who has been employed for not less than 25 years, or who is 60 years of age or older and has been employed for not less than 5 years, in monthly payments not to exceed 2.5% of the employee's highest average monthly compensation or earnings received from the county or county road fund for 5 years of service times the total number of years of service of the employee, including a fraction of a year, not to exceed 3/4 of the average final compensation of the employee. A plan may also pay early retirement benefits at 55 years of age or older to the extent of actuarially equivalent benefits not increasing the costs of the plan. Except as provided in subsection (27), endowment policies, retirement benefits, pensions, or annuity retirement benefits in excess of the amounts provided in this subdivision may be provided for by a plan of employee participation to cover the cost of the excess. If the employment or the pension or retirement benefits of an employee who participated in the cost of pension or retirement benefits are terminated before the employee receives pension or retirement benefits equal to the total amount of the employee's participation, the balance of the total participation must be refunded to the employee at the time of termination, if living, or if deceased, to the employee's heir, estate, legal representative, or designated beneficiary as provided in the plan adopted and established by the county board of commissioners. If a terminated employee is rehired by the county, the employee may repay the amount of participation refunded to the employee on the employee's termination, plus compound interest from the date of refund to the dates of repayment at the rates provided in the plan. As conditions for repayment, the plan may require return to employment for a period not to exceed 3 years and may require that repayment be completed within a period of not less than 1 year following return to employment. A plan adopted for the payment of retirement benefits or a pension must grant benefits to an employee eligible for pension or retirement benefits according to a uniform scale for all persons in the same general class or classification. An employee must not be denied benefits by termination of his or her employment after the employee becomes eligible for benefits under the plan and this section. An endowment policy or annuity purchased under this section must be purchased from an insurer authorized to write endowment policies or annuities in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In a plan adopted under this section, at least 60% of the total pension or retirement benefit granted to an employee from county funds must consist of a percentage not to exceed 2.5% of the employee's average final compensation times the employee's years of service and must be granted to each employee eligible for retirement under the plan uniformly and without restriction or limitation other than those prescribed in this section. As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Average final compensation" means the annual average of the highest actual compensation received by a county employee, other than a county employee who is a judge of a municipal court of record subject to subsection (20) or a judge subject to subsection (23), during a period of 5 consecutive years of service contained within the employee's 10 years of service immediately before the employee's retirement or a period of 5 years of service as specified in the plan. In a county that adopts a plan for granting longevity pay, the county board of commissioners may exclude this longevity pay from average final compensation for the purpose of computing the rate of employee contribution and the amount of benefits payable to an employee on retirement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Longevity pay" means increments of compensation payable at annual or semiannual intervals and based on years of service to the county, exclusive of compensation provided for a given class of positions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A circuit court stenographer is eligible for membership in, and the benefits of, a pension or retirement benefit under a plan established under this section, or a social security plan established by the county or 1 of the counties that pays a portion of the compensation of a circuit court stenographer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the employment of a county employee eligible to receive a pension or retirement benefit under a plan established under this section is terminated after the employee has completed 8 or more years of service in county employment, the employee must receive the amount of pension or retirement benefit to which the employee's service would have entitled the employee under the plan established, if the employee waives the employee's right to a refund of the employee's total participation on the termination of employment. The payment of pension or retirement benefits must begin, as provided in the plan, after the employee would have become eligible for retirement under the plan had the employee's employment not been terminated, but not later than 90 days after the employee becomes 65 years of age. The payment of pension or retirement benefits must not begin until the employee has applied for pension or retirement benefits in the manner prescribed in the plan established.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A plan established under this section may provide for pension or retirement benefits for a county employee who becomes totally disabled for work in the county service from any cause, after not less than 10 years of county employment, to the extent of the limitations provided in this section. A plan may also provide for pension or retirement benefits to the extent of the limitations provided in this section or $400.00 per month, whichever is the greater amount, for an employee who becomes totally disabled for work in the county service from causes that are the direct and proximate result of county employment, to continue for the duration of the disability or until the employee becomes eligible for retirement under other provisions of the plan authorized by this section. A plan may also provide for pension or retirement benefits, to the extent of the limitations provided in this section, for the actual dependents of a county employee who dies while still employed by the county after not less than 10 years of county employment, or who dies after leaving county employment with not less than the number of years of service required to vest in the plan but before becoming eligible to receive a pension or retirement benefit. A plan may also provide for pension or retirement benefits to the extent of the limitations provided in this section or $400.00 per month, whichever is greater, for the actual dependents of a deceased county employee whose death is the direct and proximate result of county employment. The plan may provide that the period from the end of the deceased or disabled employee's period of service to the date that employee would have become eligible for retirement is used as service for the sole purpose of computing the amount of disability or death pension.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) As used in this section, "county employee" includes a bailiff of the district court in the thirty-sixth district who serves under section 8322 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.8322, and a person who receives more than 50% of all compensation for personal services, rendered to governmental units, from a county fund or county road fund, except a person, other than a bailiff of the district court in the thirty-sixth district, engaged for special services on a contract or fee basis. Until December 31, 1979, a plan adopted under this section may include as a county employee a person on leave of absence from county employment who is not a member of another retirement system except as a retirant and who pays or arranges payment of contributions equal to the contributions that would have been required to be paid under the plan by both the county and the employee, based on the compensation the employee would have received from the county, if the employee had not taken a leave of absence or a person who complies with the requirements of such a provision approved for inclusion in a plan by the county board of commissioners before January 1, 1976, who is considered a county employee during the period of compliance. A plan adopted under this section may exclude a person who is employed on a temporary basis and a person employed in a position normally requiring less than 1,000 hours, or some lesser specified number of hours, work per year. A bailiff serving in the district court in the thirty-sixth district is eligible to receive benefits under this section if a plan has been established by law by which the cost of benefits is payable from sources including charges on all legal instruments in which the service of process by a bailiff is required and earmarked by law for benefits, and contributions made by the city of Detroit and each bailiff under section 8322(6) of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.8322. The plan must provide that a bailiff or former bailiff who served as bailiff as of January 1, 1967, may retire after 25 years of service regardless of age, with maximum benefits to be computed as follows: starting as of January 1, 1969, the average of any 5 years of earnings of the previous 10 years served in succession before retirement multiplied by 1.9% times the years of service; starting as of June 1, 1975, the average of any 5 years of earnings multiplied by 2% times the years of service. As used in this subsection, "earnings" means the salary and fees, other than mileage, received by a bailiff under section 8322(5) of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.8322. The plan must provide that health, accident, and hospitalization insurance premiums may be paid out of the earnings of this fund. These payments must be made at the discretion of the pension board of trustees. A county that has a retirement fund for bailiffs under this section shall annually review the retirement fund and shall ensure that the fund is maintained in an actuarially sound condition. Copies of the actuarial reports must be provided to the employer designated under section 8274(2) or (3) of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.8274, and to the state court administrator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An employee while receiving a pension or retirement benefit because of disability, under this section, may be considered as employed in the county service for the purpose of retirement under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A county employee who is included by law in another pension or retirement system by reason of the compensation the employee receives from the county may be excluded from a plan established under this section or included only to the extent of the difference between benefits granted under this section and the other pension or retirement system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The county board of commissioners, on the request of a county employee, by not less than a 3/5 vote may credit the county employee with the amount of government service resulting from employment with the United States government, except military service, employment with a state, or employment with any of their political subdivisions under the following conditions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Employment by the county occurred within 15 years following the county employee's separation from service of the last unit of government by which the county employee was employed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Service rendered before the last break in service of more than 15 years is not credited.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Service that is recognized for the purpose of a deferred retirement allowance under a retirement system or other employer-funded retirement benefit plan, except for a retirement benefit plan under the social security act, chapter 531, 49 Stat. 620, of the United States government, a state, or a political subdivision of a state is not credited if the county employee retired under a retirement system of the United States government, a state, or any of their political subdivisions or until the county employee irrevocably forfeits the right to the deferred retirement allowance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The county employee deposits in the plan established under this section an amount equal to the aggregate amount of contributions the county employee would have made had the service been acquired while employed by the county, plus interest from the dates the contributions would have been made to the date of deposit, at rates determined by the county board of commissioners. If records are insufficient or unavailable to compute the exact amount of required deposit, the county board of commissioners may estimate the amount.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The county employee has 8 or more years of credited service in county employment, is vested in the county plan, and deposits in the county employees' retirement system an amount equal to the aggregate amount of contributions the employer would have made had the government service being credited under this section been acquired while employed by the county.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A plan adopted under this section may provide for annual or less frequent postretirement redetermination of a pension. The redetermined amount of pension must be not greater than the amount of pension otherwise payable multiplied by the sum of 100% and the percentage the county board of commissioners determines appropriate for each full year, excluding a fraction of a year, in the period from the effective date of payments of the pension and the date that the redetermination is being made. The redetermined amount must not be less than the amount of pension otherwise payable. A provision of this section that limits the amount of a pension does not apply to the operation of this subsection redetermining the amount of a pension. As used in this subsection, "the amount of pension otherwise payable" means the amount of pension that would be payable without regard to this subsection. The application of a provision redetermining pension amounts may be restricted to pensions that have an effective date of payment either before or after a specified date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The cost of pension or retirement benefits for a county employee under this section may be paid from the same fund from which the employee receives compensation, and the county board of commissioners may appropriate the necessary funds to carry out the purposes of this section. If a county establishes a plan by which the county pays pension or retirement benefits to an employee under this section, the county, under provisions for pension or retirement benefits that are incorporated in the plan, shall establish and maintain reserves on an actuarial basis in the manner provided in this subsection sufficient to finance the pension and retirement and death benefit liabilities under the plan and sufficient to pay the pension and retirement and death benefits as they become due. A county that adopts a retirement plan under this section and establishes reserves on an actuarial basis shall maintain the reserves as provided in this subsection. The reserves must be determined by an actuarial valuation and established and maintained by yearly appropriations by the county and contributions by employees. The reserves must be established, maintained, and funded to cover the pension and other benefits provided for in the plan in the same manner and within the same limits as to time as is provided for Benefit Program B in the municipal employees retirement system described in former section 14 of the municipal employees retirement act of 1984, 1984 PA 427. These reserves are trust funds and must not be used for any other purpose than the payment of pension, retirement, and other benefits and refunds of employee contributions pursuant to the plan established in a county. An employee's contributions must be kept and accumulated in a separate fund and used only for the payment of annuities and refunds to employees. This subsection does not apply to a county that adopted a retirement plan under this section and did not establish reserves on an actuarial basis before October 11, 1947.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If a county establishes a plan for the payment of pension and retirement benefits to its employees under this section, the county board of commissioners may provide for a board of trustees to administer the plan and for the manner of election or appointment of the members of the board of trustees. The county board of commissioners may grant authority to the board of trustees to fully administer and operate the plan and to deposit, invest, and reinvest the funds and reserves of the plan within the limitations prescribed by the county board of commissioners in the plan. The county board of commissioners may authorize the investment of funds of a county retirement plan established under this section in anything in which the funds of the state employees' retirement system or the funds of the municipal employees retirement system may be invested, under the state employees' retirement act, 1943 PA 240, MCL 38.1 to 38.69, and the municipal employees retirement act of 1984, 1984 PA 427, MCL 38.1501 to 38.1555. A county retirement plan established under this section may provide for financing, funding, and the payment of benefits in the same manner and to the same extent as is provided for in the state employees' retirement act, 1943 PA 240, MCL 38.1 to 38.69, and the municipal employees retirement act of 1984, 1984 PA 427, MCL 38.1501 to 38.1555, may provide for and require contributions by county employees, and may permit additional employee contributions on a voluntary basis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) On the approval of the county board of commissioners, a member who entered the Armed Service of the United States before June 1, 1980 or who entered the Armed Service of the United States after May 31, 1980 during a time of war or emergency condition as described in section 1 of 1965 PA 190, MCL 35.61, as that section read on September 19, 2016, may elect to receive credited service for not more than 5 years of active military service.

Service must not be credited if the service is or would be credited under any other federal, state, or local publicly supported retirement system, except for service that is or would be credited under the federal government for services in the reserve. Service must not be credited under this subsection until the member has the number of years of credited service needed to vest under the plan. Only completed years and months of armed service may be credited under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) A member who enters or entered any Armed Service of the United States may purchase credited service for periods of continuous active duty lasting 30 days or more, subject to the following conditions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The county board of commissioners authorizes the purchase of credited service under this subsection by an affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the county board of commissioners.

A person participating in a transitional public employment program is not eligible for membership in a retirement system or pension plan established under this section. If the person later becomes a member of a retirement system or pension plan established under this section within 12 months after the date of termination as a participant in a transitional public employment program, service credit must be given for employment in the transitional public employment program for purposes of determining a retirement allowance on the payment by the person and the person's employer under the transitional public employment program from money provided under the former comprehensive employment and training act of 1973, Public Law 93-203, as money permits, to the retirement system of the contributions, plus regular interest, the person and the employer would have paid had the employment been rendered in a position covered by this section. During the person's employment in the transitional public employment program, the person's employer shall provide an opportunity by payroll deduction for the person to make his or her employee contribution to the applicable pension system. To provide for the eventual payment of the employer's contribution, the person's employer shall during this same period place in reserve a reasonable but not necessarily an actuarially determined amount equal to the contributions that the employer would have paid to the retirement system for those employees in the transitional public employment program as if they were members under this section, but only for the number of employees that the employer determined would transfer from the transitional public employment program into positions covered by this section. If the money provided under the former comprehensive employment and training act of 1973, Public Law 93-203, is insufficient, the person's current employer shall pay the remainder of the employer contributions. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) Subsection (15) does not exclude the participant in a transitional public employment program from the accident, disability, or other benefits available to members of a retirement system covered by this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) A plan adopted under this section may provide that an employee of the circuit court in the third judicial circuit, the common pleas court of the city of Detroit, or the recorder's court of the city of Detroit who is a member of the Wayne County employees' retirement system on August 31, 1981, who becomes an employee of the state judicial council and a member of the state employees' retirement system on September 1, 1981, receive a benefit based on the annual average of the highest actual compensation received by the employee during a period of 5 years of county or state service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) Beginning September 1, 1981, for determining the retirement benefit for a county employee who is a judge of a municipal court of record under subsection (2), "average final compensation" means the annual average of the highest actual compensation received by the judge as additional salary under section 13(2) of former 1919 PA 369, or section 9932(3) of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.9932, during a period of 5 years of service as specified in the plan.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The county employee deposits in the plan established under this section an amount equal to the aggregate amount of contributions the county employee made at the time of the previous membership service plus interest from the date of withdrawal of the accumulated contributions to the date of deposit, at rates determined by the county board of commissioners.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Any person feeling himself aggrieved by the action of the board of supervisors by the laying out, altering or discontinuing any road designated by this act, may have his damage assessed by a jury composed of 12 freeholders residing in the township where the land through which said road has been laid out, altered or discontinued is situated. Such person so complaining as against the action of such board, may, within 30 days after receiving notice in writing from the clerk of such board of supervisors of any county that any road has been laid out, altered or discontinued across lands owned by him, go before any justice of the peace in said township where such land is located and file with such justice a petition setting forth the fact of the laying out, altering or discontinuing of such road running through lands owned by him, whereby he has been, or is likely to be damaged, and further praying the court that a venire be issued summoning a jury of 12 freeholders of said township to determine the necessity of laying out, altering or discontinuing said highway, and the taking of private property therefor, and the amount of such damage he has sustained, or is likely to sustain from the action of such board as aforesaid. On the receipt of such petition the said justice shall at once give notice to the petitioner in writing of the date when said petition will be heard before him, and shall also notify in writing the supervisor of said township of the time and place when the same will be heard, which shall not be less than 6 days from the date of the petition, nor more than 12. And on the date and at the hour mentioned in said notice the justice shall direct any constable of said township then present to write the names of 24 freeholders from which to select a jury of 12 persons. On the compliance with such order by the constable, the supervisor, if he be present, and if not present, then the justice aforesaid, together with the person filing such petition, shall proceed to strike each alternately from such list, the names of 6 persons, and the remaining 12 names on said list shall constitute a jury for the purposes aforesaid. But in case any of such jurors on the original list shall be unable to sit, then the court shall direct the officer present to summon talesmen to take their places until such panel is full. When such panel is completed, the justice shall swear said jurors to well and truly determine as to the matters set forth in the petition of the person making the same. Said justice shall have full power to issue subpoenas and to compel the attendance of witnesses, the same as he would have in matters triable before him; and all proceedings on the hearing of said petition shall be conducted as nearly as may be as are trials before justices of the peace. If the jury, on hearing all of the evidence both for and against the allowance of damages, and the necessity for the taking of said lands for private purposes, shall determine that the person claiming to be grieved is entitled to damages, then they shall determine as to the amount, and the necessity for the taking of said lands, and under their hands certify to the justice such sum, and the necessity aforesaid, and, in case they determine that such person is not so entitled, they shall certify this fact to said justice, who shall, upon the rendition of such verdict, file the same, and within 10 days from the date of its rendition, transmit the same to the clerk of said county, and shall also serve a copy of the verdict and notice of all proceedings, in relation to said application upon all persons whose lands are affected by said application, which notice shall be full and explicit as to any and all proceedings had therein, and shall at the next regular meeting of the board of supervisors of his county, present the same to such board and cause it to be entered upon the minutes of such board. In case damages have been awarded, as aforesaid, then such board of supervisors shall apportion the amount to the several townships in said county, and the same when so raised shall go into and become a part of the general fund of such county, and they shall at the same time issue an order to the person or his representatives or assigns, as the case may be, for such sum on the county treasurer, and payable out of any fund in the county treasury not otherwise appropriated: Provided, That the person thus claiming damage shall file with such justice at the time he files his petition a bond in the penal sum of 50 dollars conditioned to pay all costs of such justice, officer and jury; but in case damages are awarded, then the costs of such proceedings shall be certified by said justice along with the award and become a part and parcel thereof, and payable to said petitioner in addition to the award of the jury: And provided further, That in case the jury first summoned shall not agree, then the said cause or hearing shall stand adjourned to some day fixed by said justice, but not for a longer period than 10 days; and on the day to which the same shall be continued a jury shall be empaneled and the matter submitted as hereinbefore directed.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 5.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The county agency and a unit of government may enter into agreements for a term up to but not exceeding 40 years whereby the unit of government shall pay the county for the services provided by any improvements and facilities authorized by this act, including the cost of construction and maintenance of the same, from funds collected as rates, charges, or assessments from the users and beneficiaries of the improvements, facilities, and services, or from any other fund available which may be validly used for such purposes. Any contracting unit of government may raise the amounts required to be paid under such agreements by collecting connection charges, and rates, charges, or assessments from the users and beneficiaries of the improvements, facilities, and services within that unit of government, or by levy upon the taxable property of any contracting unit of government having the power to tax in accordance with the same procedure as provided under the general tax laws of the state. The county agency may also enter into agreements with units of government providing that the county agency shall collect the connection charges, and rates, charges, or assessments for the services furnished, directly from the users and beneficiaries thereof. The county agency may enter into similar agreements with the county drain commissioner on behalf of any drain district, or with the drainage board on behalf of any inter-county drainage district, for the connection of any drain with any county sewer or sewage disposal system and for the collection by the county of connection charges, rates, and charges for the services of such county system from the users or beneficiaries thereof through connection with such drain. The county agency or such units of government in accordance with the agreements shall have the right to shut off the services and deny the use of the improvements or facilities to any user or beneficiary thereof failing to pay any of the rates, charges, or assessments as fixed. The rates, charges, or assessments for water, sewage, and sewage disposal services may be fixed in accordance with the amount of water used as measured by water meter readings or by such other methods as may be deemed equitable. Any rates, charges, or assessments shall constitute a lien on the premises served, effective immediately upon the rendering of services thereto and the official records of the agency charged with the collection thereof constitute notice of the pendency of the lien. Any rates, charges, or assessments remaining unpaid and delinquent for a period of 6 months or more may be certified by the agency charged with the collection thereof to the tax assessing officer or agency of the taxing district wherein the lands served are located and shall then be entered upon the county tax rolls against the premises to which such services shall have been rendered. The same shall be collected and the lien shall be enforced in accordance with the provisions of the general tax laws of the state.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   As an additional or alternative method of acquiring and constructing any of the improvements or facilities authorized by this act, the county, acting through its county agency, and any unit of government may enter into contracts providing for the acquisition, construction, and financing of improvements or facilities in the manner authorized in this act. The contracts shall provide for the allocation and payment of the share of the total cost to be borne by each unit of government in annual installments for a period of not exceeding 40 years, and each contracting unit of government is authorized to pledge its full faith and credit for the payment of the obligation in the manner and times specified in the contracts. A contract described in this section is not subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821. For the purpose of making payment of its pledged share of the cost of the improvements or facilities, any contracting unit of government may use any, or all, or any combination of the following methods of raising funds: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The levy of a tax on taxable property by a unit of government having the power to tax, which tax may be imposed without limitation as to rate or amount and in addition to any taxes that the unit of government may be authorized to levy but not more than the rate or amount sufficient for those purposes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The levy of special assessments on property benefited by the improvements, the procedures relative to the making and collection of the special assessments to conform as near as may be to applicable charter or statutory provisions. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The levy and collection of rates or charges to users and beneficiaries of the service furnished by the improvement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   From money received or to be received derived from the imposition of taxes by this state, except as the use of the money for that purpose is expressly prohibited by the state constitution of 1963.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   From any other funds that may be validly used for that purpose. The contracts may provide for any and all matters relating to the acquisition, construction, and financing of the improvements or facilities as are considered necessary, including the authority to the county agency to issue bonds secured by the full faith and credit contractual pledges of the contracting unit of government, as authorized by section 5c. The contracts may provide for appropriate remedies in case of default, including, but not limited to, the right of the contracting unit of government to authorize the state treasurer or other official charged with the disbursement of unrestricted state funds returnable to the governmental units under the state constitution of 1963, to withhold sufficient funds to make up any default or deficiency in funds.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 5b.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A unit of government desiring to enter into a contract under the provisions of section 5a shall authorize, by resolution of its governing body, the execution of the contract. Subsequent to the adoption of the resolution a notice thereof shall be published in a newspaper of general publication in the unit of government which notice shall state:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That the governing body has adopted a resolution authorizing execution of the contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The purpose thereof.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The source of payment of unit of government is contractual obligation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The right of referendum thereon.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Such other information as the governing body shall determine to be necessary to adequately inform all interested persons of the nature of the obligation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The contract may be executed and delivered by the unit of government upon approval by its governing body without a vote of the electors thereon, but the contract shall not become effective until the expiration of 45 days after the date of publication of such notice. If within the 45-day period a petition signed by at least 10% or 15,000, whichever is the lesser, of the registered electors residing within the limits of the unit of government is filed with the clerk thereof requesting a referendum upon the contract, the same shall not become effective until approved by the vote of a majority of the electors of the unit of government qualified to vote and voting thereon at a general or special election. Where a unit of government has, prior to the effective date of this 1974 amendment, published a resolution authorizing the execution of a contract hereunder in substantial compliance with this section, as amended, and the referendum period formerly provided by this section has expired, but the bonds have not been issued, the resolution and the publication thereof are hereby validated and, if no petition for a referendum on execution of the contract has been or is signed and filed within the time period formerly provided by this section, the contract may be executed and shall thereupon become effective without submitting the proposition for approval thereof to the electors, or if a petition has been or is so signed and filed, the contract may be executed and thereupon become effective if approved at an election as above provided. When any such contract is to be entered into by any township only on behalf of the unincorporated area of the township, only the registered electors residing within the unincorporated area of the township shall be qualified to sign the petition and vote at the election.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Any special election called for such purpose shall not be included in any statutory or charter limitation as to the number of special elections to be called within any period of time. Signatures on any such petition shall be verified by some person under oath, as the actual signatures of the persons whose names are signed thereto, and the clerk of the unit of government shall have the same power to reject signatures as city clerks under the provisions of section 25 of Act No. 279 of the Public Acts of 1909, as amended, being section 117.25 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. The number of registered electors in any unit of government shall be determined by the unit of government registration books.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Where a contracting unit of government has outstanding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of Act. No. 94 of the Public Acts of 1933, as amended, being sections 141.101 to 141.139 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, for the type of improvements or facilities to be constructed pursuant to this act and the contract, such contract may provide for the refunding of the outstanding bonds and the inclusion, in the total financing required for the construction of the improvements or facilities contemplated by this act of an amount sufficient to provide for the refunding, including such call premiums as may be required in the ordinance authorizing their issuance. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as authorizing the refunding of noncallable unmatured bonds without the consent of the holder or holders thereof. Where the refunding is provided for by the contract, any bonds issued pursuant to section 5c may be issued and sold in a sufficient amount to provide additional funds over and above acquisition and construction costs of the new improvements or facilities to enable the contracting unit of government to retire the outstanding revenue bonds.</DIV>

The bonds shall not be delivered until the contract or contracts become effective as provided in section 5b. The bonds shall be issued in the name of the county and shall be executed in such manner as provided in the resolution authorizing the bonds. Bonds issued under this act shall mature in a period not to exceed 40 years. The bonds and coupons shall taxation by be exempt from all this state or by any taxing authority within this state. The bonds shall not pledge the full faith and credit of the issuing county except as otherwise provided in this section. As additional security for the payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds issued under this section, any issuing county may, upon proper resolution adopted by a majority vote of the members-elect of its county board of commissioners, pledge the full faith and credit of the county for the prompt payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds. In the event the county is required to advance any money by reason of a pledge on account of the delinquency of any contracting unit of government and if provided in the contract, the county treasurer shall notify the state treasurer to deduct the amount of money advanced by the county from any unrestricted money in the state treasurer's possession belonging to the unit of government and to pay the amount to the county. The money shall be paid into the general fund of the county. The right of deduction to receive payment from the state treasurer given to the county by this statute shall not operate to limit the county's right to pursue any other legal remedies for the reimbursement of money advanced under this section. The board of commissioners of any county that has advanced any money and that has not been reimbursed may order a unit of government having taxing power and its officers to levy upon its next tax roll an amount sufficient to make the reimbursement on or before the date when its taxes become delinquent and the unit of government and its tax levying and collecting officials shall levy and collect the taxes and reimburse the county. The resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds shall contain the terms of the contract or contracts authorized by sections 5a and 5b. Sections 5a, 5b, and 5c shall be construed as an additional and alternative method for the acquisition, construction, and financing of the improvements or facilities contemplated by this act, and shall not affect the other provisions of this act relating to the acquisition, construction, or financing of improvements or facilities. Any improvements and facilities contemplated by this act may be acquired, constructed, and financed in part under the provisions of sections 5a, 5b, and 5c and in part under other sections of this act. This act shall not validate any drain orders or bonds issued prior to April 30, 1954.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)    Bonds issued under this act are subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</DIV>

The latest official published figures of the United States official census shall be used in this determination, except that in cases requiring division of official census units to meet the population standard, an actual population count may be used to make such division. Other governmental census figures of total population may be used if taken subsequent to the last decennial United States census and the United States census figures are not adequate for the purposes of this act. The secretary of state shall furnish the latest official published figures to the county apportionment commissions forthwith upon this act taking effect, and within 15 days after publication of subsequent United States official census figures.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A contract may be entered into with the United States census bureau to make any special census if the latest United States decennial census figures are not adequate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   All districts shall be contiguous.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   All districts shall be as compact and of as nearly square shape as is practicable, depending on the geography of the county area involved.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   No township or part thereof shall be combined with any city or part thereof for a single district, unless such combination is needed to meet the population standard.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Townships, villages and cities shall be divided only if necessary to meet the population standard.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Precincts shall be divided only if necessary to meet the population standard.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Residents of state institutions who cannot by law register in the county as electors shall be excluded from any consideration of representation.</DIV>
