</P>
<P>Sec. 11.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   There is created the employees' savings fund, employer's accumulation fund, annuity reserve fund, pension reserve fund, income fund, expense fund, and health insurance reserve fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The employees' savings fund is the fund in which shall be accumulated at regular interest the contributions to the retirement system deducted from the compensation of members. The retirement board shall provide for the maintenance of an individual account for each member that shows the amount of the member's contributions together with interest on those contributions. The accumulated contributions of a member returned to the member upon his or her withdrawal from service, or paid to the member's estate or designated beneficiary in the event of the member's death, as provided in this act, shall be paid from the employees' savings fund. Any accumulated contributions not claimed by a member or the member's legal representative as provided in this act within 5 years after the member's separation from state service shall be transferred from the employees' savings fund to the income fund. The accumulated contributions of a member, upon the member's retirement, shall be transferred from the employees' savings fund to the pension reserve fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The employer's accumulation fund is the fund in which shall be accumulated the reserves derived from money provided by this state for the payment of all retirement allowances to be payable to retirants and beneficiaries as provided in this act. The amounts paid by this state shall be credited to the employer's accumulation fund. Upon the retirement of a member, or upon the member's death, if a beneficiary is entitled to a retirement allowance payable from funds of the retirement system, the difference between the reserve for the retirement allowance to be paid on account of the member's retirement or death and the member's accumulated contributions standing to his or her credit in the employees' savings fund at the time of his or her retirement or death shall be transferred from the employer's accumulation fund to the pension reserve fund. If, in any year, the pension reserve fund is insufficient to cover the reserves for retirement allowances and other benefits being paid from the fund, the amount or amounts of the insufficiency or insufficiencies shall be transferred from the employer's accumulation fund to the pension reserve fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The annuity reserve fund is the fund from which shall be paid all annuities, or benefits in lieu of annuities, because of which reserves have been transferred from the employees' savings fund to the annuity reserve fund. Upon the adoption of this act, the balance in the annuity reserve fund shall be transferred to the pension reserve fund, and the annuities heretofore payable from the annuity reserve fund shall thereafter become payable from the pension reserve fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The pension reserve fund is the fund from which shall be paid all retirement allowances and benefits in lieu of pensions, as provided in this act. For a disability retirant returned to active service with this state, his or her pension reserve, computed as of the date of return, shall be transferred from the pension reserve fund to the employees' savings fund and the employer's accumulation fund in the proportion that this reserve, as of the date of his or her retirement, was transferred to the pension reserve fund from the employees' savings fund and from the employer's accumulation fund. The amounts transferred to the employees' savings fund under this section shall be credited to the member's individual account in the fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   An income fund is created for the purpose of crediting regular interest on the amounts in the various other funds of the retirement system with the exception of the expense fund, and to provide a contingent fund out of which special requirements of any of the other funds may be covered. Transfers for special requirements shall be made only when the amount in the income fund exceeds the ordinary requirements of the fund as evidenced by a resolution of the retirement board recorded in its minutes. The retirement board shall annually allow regular interest for the preceding year to each of the funds enumerated in subsections (2), (3), (4), (5), and (8), and the amount allowed under this subsection shall be due and payable to each of these funds and shall be annually credited to the funds by the retirement board and paid from the income fund. However, interest on contributions from members within a calendar year shall begin on the first day of the next calendar year, and shall be credited at the end of the calendar year. Except as provided in this subsection, income, interest, and dividends derived from the deposits and investments authorized by this act shall be paid into the income fund. The retirement system shall determine the share of income, interest, and dividends attributable to the balance in the health advance funding subaccount created under subsection (9) and the share of income, interest, and dividends attributable to the health advance funding subaccount balance shall be paid into the health advance funding subaccount. The retirement board is authorized to accept gifts and bequests. Any funds that come into the possession of the retirement system as a gift or bequest, or any funds that may be transferred from the employees' savings fund by reason of lack of claimant, or because of a surplus in any fund created by this act, or any other money the disposition of which is not otherwise provided for in this act shall be credited to the income fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The expense fund is the fund from which shall be paid the expenses of the administration of this act, exclusive of amounts payable as retirement allowances and other benefits provided for in this act. The legislature shall appropriate the funds necessary to defray and cover the expenses of administering this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The health insurance reserve fund is the fund into which appropriations made by the legislature, subscriber co-payments, and payments by the retirement system under section 68 for health, dental, and vision insurance premiums are paid. Health, dental, and vision insurance premiums payable pursuant to sections 20d and 68 shall be paid from the health insurance reserve fund. The assets and any earnings on the assets contained in the health insurance reserve fund and the health advance funding subaccount described in subsection (9) are not to be treated as pension assets for any purpose.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   The health advance funding subaccount is the account to which amounts transferred pursuant to sections 20d, 38(6), and 52 are credited. Any amounts received in the health advance funding subaccount and accumulated earnings on those amounts shall not be expended until the actuarial accrued liability for health benefits under section 20d is at least 100% funded. The department may expend funds or transfer funds to another account to expend for health benefits under section 20d if the actuarial accrued liability for health benefits under section 20d is at least 100% funded. For each fiscal year after the fiscal year in which the actuarial accrued liability for health benefits under section 20d is at least 100% funded by the health advance funding subaccount, amounts received in the health advance funding subaccount and accumulated earnings on those amounts may be expended or credited to fund health benefits under section 20d as provided in section 38(3). For the fiscal year ending on September 30, 2003 only, the general fund portion of all amounts received in the health advance funding subaccount as of October 1, 2002 and accumulated earnings on those amounts shall be transferred to the general fund. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the department may transfer amounts from the health advance funding subaccount to the employer's accumulation fund created under this section if the department does both of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   At least 45 days before the intended transfer, submits a request to the chairs of the senate and house appropriations committees and, at least 15 days before the intended transfer, obtains the approval of both the senate and house appropriations committees.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Ensures that the request submitted to the senate and house appropriations committees contains an actuarial valuation prepared pursuant to section 38 that demonstrates that as of the beginning of a fiscal year, and after all credits and transfers required by this act for the previous fiscal year have been made, the sum of the actuarial value of assets and the actuarial present value of future normal cost contributions does not exceed the actuarial present value of benefits.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   The description of the various funds in this section shall be interpreted to refer to the accounting records of the retirement system and not to the segregation of assets credited to the various funds of the retirement system.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this act, membership in the retirement system consists of state employees occupying permanent positions in the state civil service. All state employees except those specifically excluded by law and those who are members or eligible to be members of other statutory retirement systems in this state, must become members of the retirement system. The employees may use service previously performed as an employee of this state in meeting the service requirements for the retirement allowances and death benefits provided by the retirement system. However, the prior service must not be used in computing the amount of a retirement allowance to be paid by the retirement system unless the employee pays to the retirement system the amount the employee's contributions would have been had the employee become a member immediately on employment by the state with interest compounded annually at the regular rate from a date 1 year after the date of employment by this state to the date of payment. An individual who draws compensation as a state employee of a political subdivision of this state is eligible for the benefits provided by this act to the extent of the individual's compensation paid by this state.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A member who is 55 years of age or older, but less than 60 years of age, and has 15 or more years of credited service, may retire upon written application to the retirement board stating a date on which he or she desires to retire. Upon retirement he or she shall receive a retirement allowance computed according to section 20(1). Except as otherwise provided in this act, the retirement allowance of a member who has less than 30 years of credited service shall be reduced by an amount that is 0.5% of the retirement allowance multiplied by the number of months the person's age at retirement is under 60 years. The reduction of 1/2 of 1% for each month and fraction of a month from the member's retirement allowance effective date to the date of the member's sixtieth birthday provided for in this subsection does not apply to a member who retired before July 1, 1974 and before attainment of age 60, with 30 or more years of credited service. The retirement allowance of a retirant or beneficiary of a retirant who retired before that date shall be recalculated disregarding the reduction, and the person receiving the retirement allowance is eligible to receive an adjusted retirement allowance based on the recalculation beginning October 1, 1987, but is not eligible to receive the adjusted amount attributable to any month beginning before October 1, 1987. The recalculated retirement allowance provided by this subsection shall be paid by January 1, 1988. The retirement allowance of a retirant who dies before January 1, 1988, and who has not nominated a retirement allowance beneficiary pursuant to section 31, shall not be recalculated pursuant to this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, effective April 1, 1988, a member may retire with a retirement allowance computed according to section 20(1), without regard to the reduction in subsection (2), if all of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The member files a written application with the retirement board stating a date, not less than 30 or more than 90 days after the execution and filing of the application, on which the member desires to retire, and which is within the early retirement effective period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The member was employed by the state for the 6-month period immediately preceding the member's retirement allowance effective date. This subdivision does not apply to a member who had been restored to active service during that 6-month period pursuant to section 33.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   On the last day of the month immediately preceding the retirement allowance effective date stated in the application, the member's combined age and length of credited service is equal to or greater than 80 years and the member is 50 years of age or older.</DIV>

As used in this subsection, "deinstitutionalization" means planned reduction of state center or hospital beds through placement of individuals from the hospital or facility, or through limiting admissions to centers and hospitals, or both. If a member withdraws all or part of the member's accumulated contributions, the member ceases to be a member. Upon becoming 60 years of age or older, the member may retire upon written application to the retirement board. The application shall specify a date on which the member desires to retire. Upon retirement, the member shall receive a retirement allowance equal to the number of years and fraction of a year of credited state service multiplied by 1-1/2% of the member's final average compensation.

</P>
<P>Sec. 20g.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    After the end of each state fiscal year, the department of management and budget shall determine the rate of investment return earned on retirement system assets during the fiscal year, based upon methods established by the retirement board.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   At the end of each state fiscal year, the retirement system's actuary shall determine the present value of retirement allowances to be paid after the end of the fiscal year to retirants and retirement allowance beneficiaries in receipt of retirement allowances at the end of the fiscal period. The assumed interest rate used in the determination shall be 8% per year, compounded annually. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The distribution income at the end of each state fiscal year shall be equal to the product of the present value of retirement allowances determined in subsection (2) at the end of the previous fiscal year times the positive excess, if any, of the rate of investment return determined in subsection (1) exceeding 8%. The distribution income calculated pursuant to this subsection at the end of the fiscal years 1984-85 and 1985-86 shall be reduced by the costs of postretirement adjustments paid during the fiscal year pursuant to sections 20b, 20c, 20e, and 20f.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   After the end of each state fiscal year, each retirant and retirement allowance beneficiary in receipt of a retirement allowance at the end of the fiscal year, and whose effective date of retirement allowance preceded the beginning of that fiscal year, shall be credited with 1 distribution unit for each full year between the effective date of retirement and the end of the fiscal year and 1 distribution unit for each full year of service credit in force on the effective date of retirement. Distribution units shall not accumulate from 1 year to the next year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The distribution amount for an individual retirant or retirement allowance beneficiary shall be equal to the product of the distribution income determined in subsection (3) times the individual's number of distribution units determined in subsection (4) divided by the total number of distribution units for all eligible retirants and retirement allowance beneficiaries in receipt of retirement allowances at the end of the fiscal year. The distribution amount for an individual retirant or retirement allowance beneficiary of a retirant whose retirement allowance effective date is on or after October 1, 1987 is zero.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The distribution amount for each retirant or retirement allowance beneficiary shall be payable in the form of a supplemental payment prior to the seventh month after the end of the state fiscal year. Except as provided in subsection (9), a distribution amount shall not be payable after March 31, 1988. If a retirant dies before receipt of the distribution amount, the payment shall be made to the retirant's retirement allowance beneficiary, if any. If both the retirant and the retirement allowance beneficiary die before receipt of the distribution amount, no payment shall be made.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Each retirement allowance shall be increased each October 1 beginning with the later of October 1, 1988 or the first October 1 which is at least 12 months after the retirement allowance effective date. The amount of the annual increase shall be equal to 3% of the retirement allowance that would be payable as of the date of the increase without application of this subsection, except that if the member made the election permitted under section 20(2), the increase shall be based on the amount of retirement allowance that would have been paid without application of section 20(2). The annual increase shall not exceed $300.00.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   After the end of each state fiscal year, the cumulative increase amount shall be computed for each retirant or retirement allowance beneficiary. The cumulative increase amount shall be equal to the difference between the total retirement allowance paid during the state fiscal year and the retirement allowance that would have been payable without application of subsection (7) and section 20h. The cumulative increase amount for any retirant or retirement allowance beneficiary whose retirement allowance effective date is on or after October 1, 1987 is zero.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   In March of each year, beginning in March, 1989, each retirant or retirement allowance beneficiary shall be paid, in a single supplemental payment, the excess, if any, of the distribution amount over the cumulative increase amount for the previous state fiscal year. If a retirant dies before receipt of a supplemental payment, the supplemental payment shall be made to the retirant's retirement allowance beneficiary, if any. If both the retirant and the retirement allowance beneficiary die before receipt of a supplemental payment, no payment shall be made.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 23.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Upon retirement for disability as provided in section 21, a member who is less than 60 years old shall receive a disability retirement allowance calculated under section 20(1). A disability retirement allowance payable under this subsection is payable beginning on the first day of the month following the date the member becomes totally incapacitated for state employment. A disability retirement allowance payable under this subsection shall not be paid before the first day of the month after the later of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Twelve months before the date the application for a disability retirement allowance was filed with the retirement system under section 21.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)    The date the disability retirant's name last appeared on the state payroll with pay.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Upon attaining age 60 years, a disability retirant under subsection (1) shall receive a retirement allowance calculated under section 20. For the purpose of calculating that retirant's retirement allowance, the retirant shall be given membership service credit for the period during which the retirant was receiving the disability retirement allowance provided for in subsection (1). If the computation results in a retirement allowance less than the disability retirement allowance provided in subsection (1), the retirant shall receive a retirement allowance equal to the disability retirement allowance provided in subsection (1). Upon attaining age 60, the retirant may elect an option provided for in section 31(1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   During the period a disability retirant is receiving a disability retirement allowance under subsection (1), the retirant's contributions to the employees' savings fund shall be suspended and the balance in the fund, that is credited to the retirant as of the date the disability retirement allowance begins, shall remain in the savings fund and shall be accumulated at regular interest. Upon attaining age 60 years, the disability retirant's accumulated contributions shall be transferred from the employees' savings fund to the pension reserve fund. If the disability retirant should die before attaining age 60 years, the accumulated contributions standing to the disability retirant's credit in the employees' savings fund shall be paid to the person or persons the disability retirant nominated by written designation executed and filed with the retirement system, or if there is not a designated person or persons surviving, then to the disability retirant's legal representative or estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The disability retirement allowance payable to a disability retirant under this section shall not be less than $6,000.00 per year. A disability retirement allowance first payable to a disability retirant under this section shall not be more than an amount that when added to the worker's compensation benefits payable to the disability retirant exceeds the disability retirant's final compensation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the disability retirant who retired under section 21 dies before reaching age 60, the retirement allowance payable to the beneficiary designated by the disability retirant shall be calculated as provided in section 20(1). For the purpose of calculating the retirement allowance payable to the beneficiary designated by the disability retirant, the deceased retirant shall be given membership service credit for the period during which the retirant was receiving the disability retirement allowance provided for in subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The receipt of a disability retirement allowance under this section is subject to sections 33 and 34.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in subsections (3), (4), and (5), if a member dies as a result of a personal injury or disease arising out of and in the course of his or her employment with the state and the personal injury or disease resulting in death is found by the retirement board to have been the sole and exclusive result of employment with the state, the surviving spouse shall receive a retirement allowance calculated as if the deceased member had retired effective the day before the date of death, elected option A under section 31(1), and nominated his or her spouse as retirement allowance beneficiary. The retirement allowance shall be calculated under section 20(1) based upon the amount of the deceased member's credited service. If the deceased member does not have the minimum number of years of credited service needed to vest in the retirement system, the amount of service necessary to reach that amount of credited service shall be granted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The retirement allowance payable to a surviving spouse under this section shall not be less than $6,000.00 per year. The retirement allowance first payable to a surviving spouse under subsection (1) shall not be more than an amount that, when added to the statutory worker's disability compensation benefits payable to the surviving spouse of the deceased member, equals the deceased member's final compensation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the requirements of subsection (1) are met but the deceased member is survived by a spouse and a child or children under 21 years of age, then the retirement allowance calculated under subsections (1) and (2) shall be payable as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) One-half to the surviving spouse.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) One-half to the surviving child or children under 21 years of age, in equal shares. The retirement allowance payable to a surviving child under this subsection shall terminate upon that child's marriage, death, or becoming 21 years of age, whichever occurs first. That child's share of the terminated retirement allowance shall be redistributed among the remaining children under 21 years of age, if any. When there are no surviving children entitled to a share of the retirement allowance under this subsection, the children's share shall revert to the surviving spouse.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the requirements of subsection (1) are met and the deceased member is not survived by a spouse but is survived by a child or children under 21 years of age, then the retirement allowance calculated under subsections (1) and (2) shall be paid to the surviving child or children in equal shares. The retirement allowance payable to a surviving child under this subsection shall terminate upon that child's marriage, death, or becoming 21 years of age, whichever occurs first. That child's share of the terminated retirement allowance shall be redistributed among the remaining children under 21 years of age, if any.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the other requirements of subsection (1) are met and neither a surviving spouse nor an eligible child surviving the deceased member or duty disability retirant exists, a monthly allowance shall be paid to 1 surviving dependent parent whom the retirement board finds to be totally and permanently disabled and to have been dependent upon the deceased member or retirant for at least 50% of the parent's financial support. Subject to section 20j, the allowance shall be computed in the same manner as if the deceased member or retirant had retired for reasons of age and service effective the day preceding the member's or retirant's death, elected the option provided in section 31(1)(a), and nominated the surviving parent as retirement allowance beneficiary. The surviving parent's beneficiary retirement allowance shall terminate upon marriage or death.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 31.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as provided in subsection (6), before the effective date of retirement, but not after the effective date of retirement, a member or deferred member who is eligible for retirement, as provided in this act, shall elect to receive his or her benefit in a retirement allowance payable throughout life, which shall be called a regular retirement allowance, or to receive the actuarial equivalent at that time of his or her regular retirement allowance in a reduced retirement allowance payable throughout the lives of the retirant and a retirement allowance beneficiary, pursuant to 1 of the following payment options:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Option A. Upon the retirant's death, his or her reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to the retirement allowance beneficiary whom the member nominated by written designation executed and filed with the retirement board before the effective date of his or her retirement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Option B. Upon the retirant's death, 1/2 of his or her reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to the retirement allowance beneficiary whom the member nominated by written designation executed and filed with the retirement board before the effective date of his or her retirement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Option C. On and after January 1, 2000, upon the retirant's death, 3/4 of his or her reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to the retirement allowance beneficiary whom the member nominated by written designation executed and filed with the retirement board before the effective date of his or her retirement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as provided in subsections (3) and (8), the election of a payment option under subsection (1) shall not be changed on or after the effective date of the retirement allowance. A retirement allowance beneficiary designated under this section shall not be changed on or after the effective date of the retirement allowance, and shall be either a spouse, brother, sister, parent, child, including an adopted child, or grandchild of the person making the designation. Payment to a retirement allowance beneficiary shall begin on the first day of the month following the death of the retirant or member.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the retirement allowance beneficiary named under a payment option under subsection (1) predeceases the retirant, the retirant's benefit shall revert to the regular retirement allowance, effective with the first day of the month following the retirement allowance beneficiary's death. For a retirant whose effective date of retirement was on or before June 28, 1976, this subsection shall apply, but the regular retirement allowance is not payable for any month beginning before the later of the retirement allowance beneficiary's death or January 1, 1986. A retirant who on January 1, 1986 is receiving a reduced retirement allowance because the retirant designated a retirement allowance beneficiary and the retirement allowance beneficiary predeceased the retirant is eligible to receive the regular retirement allowance beginning January 1, 1986, but the regular retirement allowance is not payable for any month beginning before January 1, 1986.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A member who continues in the employ of this state on and after the date he or she acquires 10 years of service credit or becomes eligible for deferred retirement as provided by section 20(4) or (5), whichever occurs first, may by written declaration executed and filed with the retirement board elect option A, provided for in subsection (1)(a), and nominate a retirement allowance beneficiary in the same manner as if the member were then retiring from service, notwithstanding that the member may not have attained 60 years of age. If the beneficiary's death or divorce from the member occurs before the effective date of the member's retirement, the member's election of option A and nomination of retirement allowance beneficiary shall be automatically revoked and the member may again elect option A and nominate a retirement allowance beneficiary at any time before the effective date of retirement. If a member who has made an election and nominated a retirement allowance beneficiary as provided in this subsection dies before the effective date of his or her retirement, then the retirement allowance beneficiary shall immediately receive the retirement allowance that he or she would have been entitled to receive under option A if the member had been regularly retired on the date of the member's death. Except as otherwise provided by subsection (5), if a member who has made an election under this subsection subsequently retires under this act, his or her election of option A shall take effect at the time of retirement. Subject to the requirements of subsection (5), the member, before the effective date of retirement, but not after the effective date of retirement, may revoke his or her previous election of option A and elect to receive his or her retirement allowance as a regular retirement allowance or under option B or C as provided for in subsection (1). A retirement allowance shall not be paid under this subsection on account of the death of a member if any benefits are paid under section 27 on account of his or her death. If a deferred member who has an option A election in effect dies before the effective date of his or her retirement, the retirement allowance payable under option A shall be paid to the retirement allowance beneficiary at the time the deceased deferred member otherwise would have been eligible to begin receiving benefits.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a member, deferred member, retiring member, or retiring deferred member is married at the effective date of the retirement allowance, an election under this section, other than an election of a payment option under subsection (1) naming the spouse as retirement allowance beneficiary, shall not be effective unless the election is signed by the spouse. However, this requirement may be waived by the retirement board if the signature of a spouse cannot be obtained because of extenuating circumstances. As used in this subsection, "spouse" means the person to whom the member, deferred member, retiring member, or retiring deferred member is married at the effective date of the retirement allowance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Until July 1, 1991, upon request in a form as determined by the retirement board, a nonduty disability retirant who retired under section 24 may change his or her election to receive a disability retirement allowance computed as a regular retirement allowance and elect to receive the actuarial equivalent at the time of the election pursuant to this subsection of his or her disability retirement allowance in a reduced retirement allowance payable to the retirant and the retirant's spouse pursuant to the provisions of a payment option as provided in subsection (1), if the disability retirement allowance effective date was before November 12, 1985 and the retirant had 25 or more years of credited service on the disability retirement allowance effective date. The nonduty disability retirant shall begin to receive the reduced retirement allowance under this subsection effective the first day of the month following the month in which the retirant makes the election pursuant to this subsection. As used in this subsection, "spouse" means the person to whom the nonduty disability retirant was married on the effective date of his or her disability retirement allowance and on the date the retirant makes the election pursuant to this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If a member who continues in the employ of this state on and after the date he or she acquires 10 years of service credit, or on and after the date he or she becomes eligible for deferred retirement as provided by section 20(4) or (5), whichever occurs first, and who does not have an election of option A in force as provided in subsection (4), dies before the effective date of retirement and leaves a surviving spouse, the spouse shall receive a retirement allowance computed in the same manner as if the member had retired effective the day before the date of his or her death, elected option A, and nominated the spouse as retirement allowance beneficiary. When the retirement allowance beneficiary dies, his or her retirement allowance shall terminate. If the aggregate amount of retirement allowance payments received by the beneficiary is less than the accumulated contributions credited to the member's account in the employees' savings fund at the time of the member's death, the difference between the accumulated contributions and the aggregate amount of retirement allowance payments received by the beneficiary shall be transferred from the employer's accumulation fund or pension reserve fund to the employees' savings fund and paid pursuant to section 29. A retirement allowance shall not be paid under this subsection on account of the death of a member if benefits are paid under section 27 on account of his or her death. If the other requirements of this subsection are met but a surviving spouse does not exist, each of the deceased member's surviving children less than 18 years of age shall receive an allowance of an equal share of the retirement allowance that would have been paid to the spouse if living at the time of the deceased member's death. Payments under this subsection shall cease upon the surviving child's marriage, adoption, or becoming 18 years of age, which occurs first.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If a retirant receiving a reduced retirement allowance under a payment option under subsection (1) is divorced from the spouse who had been designated as the retirant's retirement allowance beneficiary under the option, the election of the payment option shall be considered void by the retirement system if the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, or an amended judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, described in the public employee retirement benefit protection act and dated after June 27, 1991 provides that the election of the payment option under subsection (1) is to be considered void by the retirement system and the retirant provides a certified copy of the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, or an amended judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, to the retirement system. If the election of a payment option under subsection (1) is considered void by the retirement system under this subsection, the retirant's retirement allowance shall revert to a regular retirement allowance, including postretirement adjustments, if any, subject to an award or order of the court as described in the public employee retirement benefit protection act. The retirement allowance shall revert to a regular retirement allowance under this subsection effective the first of the month after the date the retirement system receives a certified copy of the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court. This subsection does not supersede a judgment of divorce or award or order of the court in effect on June 27, 1991. This subsection does not require the retirement system to distribute or pay retirement assets on behalf of a retirant in an amount that exceeds the actuarially determined amount that would otherwise become payable if a judgment of divorce had not been rendered.</DIV>

Should the earnings of the person retired under section 21, 24, or 67a be later changed, the amount of his or her retirement allowance shall be further modified in like manner.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The annual level percent of payroll contribution rate to finance the benefits provided under this act shall be determined by actuarial valuation pursuant to subsections (2) and (3), upon the basis of the risk assumptions adopted by the retirement board with approval of the department of technology, management, and budget, and in consultation with the investment counsel and the actuary. An annual actuarial valuation shall be made of the retirement system in order to determine the actuarial condition of the retirement system and the required contribution to the retirement system. The actuary shall report to the legislature by April 15 of each year on the actuarial condition of the retirement system as of the end of the previous fiscal year and on the projections of state contributions for the next fiscal year. The actuary shall certify in the report that the techniques and methodologies used are generally accepted within the actuarial profession and that the assumptions and cost estimates used fall within the range of reasonable and prudent assumptions and cost estimates. An annual actuarial gain-loss experience study of the retirement system shall be made in order to determine the financial effect of variations of actual retirement system experience from projected experience.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The contribution rate for monthly benefits payable in the event of the death of a member before retirement or the disability of a member shall be computed using an individual projected benefit entry age normal cost method of valuation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the contribution rate for benefits shall be computed using an individual projected benefit entry age normal cost method of valuation. For the 1995-96 state fiscal year and for each subsequent fiscal year in which the actuarial accrued liability for health benefits is less than 100% funded, the contribution rate for benefits provided under section 20d shall be computed using a cash disbursement method with the payment schedule for the employer being based upon and applied to the combined payrolls of the employees who are members and qualified participants. Beginning in the fiscal year after the fiscal year in which the actuarial accrued liability for health benefits under section 20d is at least 100% funded by the health advance funding subaccount created under section 11(9), and continuing for each subsequent fiscal year, the contribution rate for health benefits provided under section 20d shall be computed using an individual projected benefit entry age normal cost method of valuation. The contribution rate for service that may be rendered in the current year, the normal cost contribution rate, shall be equal to the aggregate amount of individual entry age normal costs divided by 1% of the aggregate amount of active members' valuation compensation. The unfunded actuarial accrued liability shall be equal to the actuarial present value of benefits reduced by the actuarial present value of future normal cost contributions and the actuarial value of assets on the valuation date. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the unfunded actuarial accrued liability shall be amortized in accordance with generally accepted governmental accounting standards over a period equal to or less than 40 years, with the payment schedule for the employer being based upon and applied to the combined payrolls of the employees who are members and qualified participants. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The legislature annually shall appropriate to the retirement system the amount determined pursuant to subsections (2) and (3). The state treasurer shall transfer monthly to the retirement system an amount equal to the product of the contribution rates determined in subsections (2) and (3) times the aggregate amount of active member or qualified participant compensation, as appropriate, paid during that month. Not later than 60 days after the termination of each state fiscal year, the executive secretary of the retirement board shall certify to the director of the department of technology, management, and budget the actual aggregate compensations paid to active members and qualified participants during the preceding state fiscal year. Upon receipt of that certification, the director of the department of technology, management, and budget shall compute the difference, if any, between actual state contributions received during the preceding state fiscal year and the product of the contribution rates determined in subsections (2) and (3) times the aggregate compensations paid to active members or qualified participants, as appropriate, during the preceding state fiscal year. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5), the difference, if any, shall be submitted in the executive budget to the legislature for appropriation in the next succeeding state fiscal year. This subsection does not apply for those fiscal years in which a deposit occurs pursuant to subsection (6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) For differences occurring in fiscal years beginning on or after October 1, 1991, a minimum of 20% of the difference between the estimated and the actual aggregate compensation and the estimated and the actual contribution rate described in subsection (4), if any, may be submitted in the executive budget to the legislature for appropriation in the next succeeding state fiscal year and a minimum of 25% of the remaining difference shall be submitted in the executive budget to the legislature for appropriation in each of the following 4 state fiscal years, or until 100% of the remaining difference is submitted, whichever first occurs. In addition, interest shall be included for each year that a portion of the remaining difference is carried forward. The interest rate shall equal the actuarially assumed rate of investment return for the state fiscal year in which payment is made. This subsection does not apply for those fiscal years in which a deposit occurs pursuant to subsection (6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For each fiscal year that begins on or after October 1, 2001, if the actuarial valuation prepared pursuant to this section for each fiscal year demonstrates that as of the beginning of a fiscal year, and after all credits and transfers required by this act for the previous fiscal year have been made, the sum of the actuarial value of assets and the actuarial present value of future normal cost contributions exceeds the actuarial present value of benefits, the annual level percent of payroll contribution rate as determined pursuant to subsections (1), (2), and (3) may be deposited into the health advance funding subaccount created under section 11(9).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, if the retirement board establishes an arrangement and fund as described in section 6 of the public employee retirement benefit protection act, 2002 PA 100, MCL 38.1686, the benefits that are required to be paid from that fund shall be paid from a portion of the employer contributions described in this section or other eligible funds. The retirement board shall determine the amount of the employer contributions or other eligible funds that shall be allocated to that fund and deposit that amount in that fund before it deposits any remaining employer contributions or other eligible funds in the pension fund.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) This section is enacted under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, which imposes certain administrative requirements and benefit limitations for qualified governmental plans. This state intends that the retirement system be a qualified pension plan created in trust under section 401 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, and that the trust be an organization exempt from taxation under section 501 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 501. The department shall administer the retirement system to fulfill this intent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The retirement system shall be administered in compliance with section 415 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, and regulations under that section that are applicable to governmental plans and, beginning January 1, 2010, applicable provisions of the final regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service on April 5, 2007. Employer-financed benefits provided by the retirement system under this act must not exceed the applicable limitations set forth in section 415 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, as adjusted by the commissioner of internal revenue under section 415(d) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, to reflect cost-of-living increases, and the retirement system shall adjust the benefits, including benefits payable to retirants and retirement allowance beneficiaries, subject to the limitation each calendar year to conform with the adjusted limitation. For purposes of section 415(b) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, the applicable limitation applies to aggregated benefits received from all qualified pension plans for which the office of retirement services coordinates administration of that limitation. If there is a conflict between this section and another section of this act, this section prevails. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The assets of the retirement system must be held in trust and invested for the sole purpose of meeting the legitimate obligations of the retirement system and must not be used for any other purpose. The assets must not be used for or diverted to a purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members, vested former members, retirants, and retirement allowance beneficiaries before satisfaction of all retirement system liabilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The retirement system shall return post-tax member contributions made by a member and received by the retirement system to a member on retirement, under Internal Revenue Service regulations and approved Internal Revenue Service exclusion ratio tables.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The required beginning date for retirement allowances and other distributions must not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee attains age 70-1/2 or April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee retires. The required minimum distribution requirements imposed by section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, apply to this act and must be administered in accordance with a reasonable and good faith interpretation of the required minimum distribution requirements for all years to which the required minimum distribution requirements apply to the retirement system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the retirement system is terminated, the interest of the members, vested former members, retirants, and retirement allowance beneficiaries in the retirement system is nonforfeitable to the extent funded as described in section 411(d)(3) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 411, and related Internal Revenue Service regulations applicable to governmental plans.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act to the contrary that would limit a distributee's election under this act, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the retirement board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. This subsection applies to distributions made after December 31, 1992. Beginning October 1, 2010, a nonspouse beneficiary may elect to have any portion of an amount payable under this act that is an eligible rollover distribution treated as a direct rollover that will be paid in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 408, that is established for the purpose of receiving a distribution on behalf of the beneficiary and that will be treated as an inherited individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity under section 402(c)(11) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 402.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) For purposes of determining actuarial equivalent retirement allowances under sections 31(1) and 20(2), the actuarially assumed interest rate must be determined by the director of the department of technology, management, and budget and the retirement board in consultation with the actuary using the mortality tables adopted by the department of technology, management, and budget and the retirement board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act to the contrary, the compensation of a member of the retirement system must be taken into account for any year under the retirement system only to the extent that it does not exceed the compensation limit established in section 401(a)(17) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, as adjusted by the commissioner of internal revenue. This subsection applies to an individual who first becomes a member of the retirement system after September 30, 1996.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act to the contrary, contributions, benefits, and service credit with respect to qualified military service must be provided under the retirement system in accordance with section 414(u) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 414. This subsection applies to all qualified military service after December 11, 1994. Beginning on January 1, 2007, in accordance with section 401(a)(37) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, if a member dies while performing qualified military service for purposes of determining death benefits payable under this act, the member is treated as having resumed and then terminated employment because of death.</div>

The adjustment under this subsection shall not be less than 0% and shall not be more than 4%.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The administrative law judge may subpoena witnesses and documentary evidence on his or her own motion, and shall do so at the request of the controlling board or the teacher.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Not later than 20 days after service of the preliminary decision and order, a party may file with the tenure commission a statement of exceptions to the preliminary decision and order or to any part of the record or proceedings, including, but not limited to, rulings on motions or objections, along with a written brief in support of the exceptions. The party shall serve a copy of the statement of exceptions and brief upon each of the other parties within the time limit for filing the exceptions and brief. If there are no exceptions timely filed, the preliminary decision and order becomes the tenure commission's final decision and order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) Not later than 10 days after being served with the other party's exceptions and brief, a party may file a statement of cross-exceptions responding to the other party's exceptions or a statement in support of the preliminary decision and order with the tenure commission, along with a written brief in support of the cross-exceptions or of the preliminary decision and order. The party shall serve a copy of the statement of cross-exceptions or of the statement in support of the preliminary decision and order and a copy of the brief on each of the other parties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) A matter that is not included in a statement of exceptions filed under subdivision (j) or in a statement of cross-exceptions filed under subdivision (k) is considered waived and cannot be heard before the tenure commission or on appeal to the court of appeals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) If exceptions are filed, the tenure commission, after review of the record and the exceptions, may adopt, modify, or reverse the preliminary decision and order.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) After giving the party notice and an opportunity to comply, the administrative law judge or the tenure commission may dismiss an appeal or deny a discharge or demotion for a party's lack of progress or for a party's repeated failure to comply with the procedures specified in this section or the tenure commission's rules.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A party aggrieved by a final decision and order of the tenure commission may appeal the decision and order to the court of appeals in accordance with the Michigan court rules within 20 days after the date of the decision and order.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Blank forms for applications shall be furnished by the commission, without charge, to all individuals requesting applications. The commission may require, in connection with an application, certificates of citizens, physicians, or others having knowledge of the applicant as the good of the service requires. The commission may refuse to examine an applicant or, after examination, to certify as eligible, an applicant who falls under any of the following disqualifications:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Lacks any of the established preliminary requirements for the examination or position of employment for which the applicant applied. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Is so disabled as to be rendered unfit for the performance of the duties of the position to which the applicant seeks appointment. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Is a habitual user of intoxicating liquors or an illegal user of 1 or more controlled substances. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Has been found guilty of any felony. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Has been dismissed from the public service for delinquency or misconduct. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Refuses to comply with the rules and regulations of the commission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If an applicant feels aggrieved by the action of the commission in refusing to examine the applicant or, after an examination, to certify the applicant as eligible, the commission, at the request of the applicant, shall appoint a time and a place for a public hearing at which time the applicant may appear, personally or with counsel, and the commission shall then review its refusal of examination or certification, and testimony shall be taken. The commission shall subpoena, at the expense of the applicant, any competent witnesses requested by the applicant. After review, the commission shall file the testimony taken in its records and shall again make a decision, which decision shall be final.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Before appointment, all applicants for a position in the fire or police department shall undergo a physical examination, which may be performed by a licensed physician, a licensed physician's assistant, or a certified nurse practitioner, to determine that an applicant is free from defects, deformity, or diseases that might incapacitate the applicant from the performance of the duties of the position desired. Applications will not be accepted if the person applying has not attained the age of majority under state law. If an applicant has formerly served upon the fire or police department of the city, village, or municipality to which application is made and has resigned from the department at a time when there were no charges of misconduct or other misfeasance pending against the applicant, within a period of 2 years next preceding the date of the application, and is a resident of the city, village, or municipality or the area authorized by city charter, then the applicant shall be eligible for reinstatement at the discretion of a civil service commission. The applicant, providing the former term of service justifies, may be reappointed to the fire or police department without examination other than a physical examination. If an applicant is reinstated to the fire or police department, the applicant shall be the lowest in rank in the department next above the probationers of the department. This subsection does not require new or additional third party reimbursement or worker's compensation benefits for services rendered.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 11.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The civil service commission in each city, village, or municipality shall make rules providing for examinations of applicants for positions in the paid fire or police departments in each city, village, or municipality under this act, for appointments, and for such other matters as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this act. The minimum passing grade for numerically scored entry level examinations shall be at least 70. Seventy shall designate the applicant's demonstration of the minimum acceptable level of performance on the individual or cumulative selection procedures, or both. After initial appointment, the minimum passing grade for any examination shall be at least 70%. Due notice of the contents of the rules and of any modifications to the rules shall be given, by mail, in due season, to appointing officers affected thereby, and the rules and rule modifications shall be printed also for public distribution. All original appointments to any positions in a fire department, within the terms of this act, shall be for a probationary period of 6 months. All original appointments to any positions in a police department, within the terms of this act, shall be for a probationary period of 1 year after the completion of legally required courses of basic training. At any time during the probationary period, an appointee may be dismissed for cause, in the manner provided in this act. If at the close of this probationary term the conduct or capacity of the probationer has not been satisfactory to the appointing officer, the probationer shall be notified within 10 days, in writing, that he or she will not receive permanent appointment, whereupon his or her employment shall cease. Otherwise, his or her retention in the service shall be equivalent to final appointment. The probationer shall be entitled to a hearing before the commission as provided in section 14.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Every entry position, unless filled by reinstatement, shall be filled only in the following manner: The appointing officer shall notify the civil service commission of any vacancy in the service which he or she desires to be filled, and shall request the certification of eligibles. The commission immediately shall certify from the eligible list the names of the persons who received the highest 5 average composite scores on examinations held under the provisions of this act within a period of 2 years next preceding the date of the appointment. The appointing officer, thereupon, with sole reference to the merit and fitness of the candidates, shall make the appointment from the names certified. As each subsequent vacancy occurs, precisely the same procedure shall be followed. When an appointment is made under this section, it shall be in the first instance for the probationary period, as provided in this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   All positions, other than entry, shall be filled only in the following manner: The appointing officer shall notify the civil service commission of any vacancy in the service which he or she desires to be filled and shall request the certification of eligibles. The commission immediately shall certify from the eligible list the name of the person who received the highest average at preceding examinations held under the provisions of this act within a period of 2 years next preceding the date of the appointment. The appointing officer, thereupon, with sole reference to the merit and fitness of the candidates, shall make the appointment certified. As each subsequent vacancy occurs, precisely the same procedure shall be followed. When an appointment is made under this section, it shall be in the first instance for the probationary period, as provided in this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Whenever there are urgent reasons for filling a vacancy in any position in the fire or police department and there is no list of persons eligible for appointment, the appointing officer may nominate a person to the civil service commission for a noncompetitive examination. If the nominee is certified by the commission as qualified, after a noncompetitive examination, he or she may be appointed temporarily to fill the vacancy until a selection and appointment can be made after a competitive examination, and in the manner prescribed in this act. However, the temporary appointment shall not continue for more than 3 months, nor shall successive temporary appointments be made to the same position. In the event of an emergency due to a war in which this country is involved, the civil service commission may make temporary appointments to fill vacancies when appointments cannot be made under the provisions of this act. These appointments shall be temporary, and only during hostilities, and for 6 months thereafter.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   In event any position as an electrician, mechanic, radio engineer, fire inspector, or fire alarm operator is to be filled in a paid fire or police department, then the examination to be given to applicants shall be so drawn as to test only the qualifications of the applicants in regard to their ability as an electrician, mechanic, radio engineer, fire inspector, or fire alarm operator. The examinations shall be special examinations.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   As used in this section, "appointing officer" means the mayor or principal administrative or executive officer in any city, village, or municipality.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 12.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    All examinations for positions shall be practical in their character and shall relate to those matters and shall include those inquiries as will fairly and fully test the comparative merit and fitness of the persons examined to discharge the duties of the employment sought by them. All examinations shall be open to all applicants who have fulfilled the preliminary requirements prescribed by this act. Notice of the time and place for accepting applications shall be given by the commission by publication for 2 weeks in the official paper of the city, village, or municipality, and the notice shall be posted by the commission in a conspicuous place in the office and on the bulletin boards of the city, village, or municipality for 2 weeks. Further notice may be given as the commission shall prescribe. However, a newspaper advertisement shall not be required for an examination for a promotion. The examination process shall begin within 6 months after the closing date for the acceptance of applications. However, the commission may delay or cancel the examination process for good cause. The commission shall post, in a public place at its office, the eligible list containing the names and grades of those who have passed examinations for positions or promotions in fire or police departments under this act, and shall indicate any appointments that will be made from the list. No question in any form of application or in any examination shall be so framed as to elicit information concerning the political or religious opinions or affiliations of any applicant; nor shall inquiries be made concerning those opinions or affiliations; and all disclosures thereof shall be discouraged. Discrimination shall not be exercised, threatened, or promised by any person in the fire or police department against or in favor of an eligible applicant or employee in fire or police departments under this act because of his or her political or religious opinions or affiliations.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Vacancies in positions in the fire and police departments above the rank of fire fighter or police officer shall be competitive and shall be filled by promotions from among persons holding positions in the next lower rank in the departments who have completed 2 years in that rank and who have at least 5 years in the department. If there are more vacancies than there are persons with 5 years in the department, the commission may lower the requirements to 3 years in the department. If no person or persons have completed 2 years in the next lower rank, the commission may hold examinations among persons in such rank as to all intent and purposes as though 2 years of service had been completed by those persons. Promotions shall be based upon merit to be ascertained by tests to be provided by the civil service commission and upon the superior qualifications of the persons promoted as shown by his or her previous service and experience. In the event of only 1 person in the next lower rank, 1 or more persons in the second lower rank who have completed at least 5 years in the department may compete for the vacancy. Whenever a position becomes vacant for which examinations are held, the appointing power shall ask the commission for the name of the person eligible for appointment. The commission shall certify the name of the person highest on the eligible list at preceding examinations held under this act within a period of 2 years next preceding the date of the appointment for the class to which the vacant position has been allocated, who is willing to accept employment. If more than 1 vacancy is to be filled, an additional name shall be certified for each additional vacancy. The appointing power immediately shall appoint the person to the position. To enable the appointing power to exercise a choice in the filling of positions of promotion in the fire or police service, a promotion shall not be considered complete until after the expiration of a period of 6 months' probationary service, and if at the end of the probationary period the appointing authority finds that the conduct or capacity of the probationer has not been satisfactory, the appointing authority shall notify the probationer and the commission in writing. Otherwise, his or her retention in the higher position shall be equivalent to receiving full status and regular employment in the higher position. The probationer, upon receiving notice that his or her conduct or capacity has not been satisfactory in the higher position, may demand a written statement of particulars of reasons for that determination and may demand a hearing before the commission. The demands shall be in writing. In such a case, the probationer shall be entitled to a hearing before the commission and to a statement of particulars to be served not less than 7 days before the date of the hearing. The commission may affirm or reverse the decision of the appointing authority or may order an additional probation period not to exceed 6 months. The decision of the commission shall be final. If the probationer does not receive full status and regular employment in the higher position, he or she shall resume the duties of his or her former position, and the appointing power shall be entitled to another certification of eligibles in accordance with this act.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   No person shall be reduced in pay or position, laid off, suspended, discharged or otherwise discriminated against by any appointing officer for religious or political reasons or affiliations. In all cases of reductions, layoff, or suspension of an employee or subordinate, whether appointed for a definite term or otherwise the appointing authority shall furnish such employees or subordinate with a copy of reasons for layoff, reduction, or suspension and his reasons for the same, and give such employee or subordinate a reasonable time in which to make and file an explanation. Such order together with the explanation, if any, of the subordinate shall be filed with the commission: Provided, however, That the employee or subordinate shall be entitled to a hearing before the commission as provided in section 14. Nothing in this act contained shall limit the power of an appointing officer to suspend without pay, for purposes of discipline, an employee or subordinate for a reasonable period, not exceeding 30 days: Provided, however, That successive suspensions shall not be allowed, and after such suspension, employees shall be entitled to a hearing as provided for in this section and in section 14: And provided further, That the provisions of this act shall not apply to temporary and exceptional appointments made under the authority of this act.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 14.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The tenure of each person holding an office, place, position, or employment under this act shall be only during good behavior and efficient service, and any person may be removed or discharged, suspended without pay, and deprived of vacation privileges or other special privileges by the civil service commission for incompetency, inefficiency, dishonesty, drunkenness, immoral conduct, insubordination, discourteous treatment to the public, neglect of duty, a violation of this act or of the rules of the commission, or for any other failure of good behavior, or for any other acts of misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. However, a member of any fire or police department encompassed by this act shall not be removed, discharged, reduced in rank or pay, suspended, or otherwise punished except for cause, and in no event until he or she has been furnished with a written statement of the charges and the reasons for the actions. In addition, all charges shall be void unless filed within 90 days after the date the violation occurred, except in the case of a probationer, whose violations may accumulate for the probationary period. In each case where charges have been made a copy of the statement of the reasons for the charges and the answers thereto, if the person sought to be removed desires to file a written answer, shall be furnished to the civil service commission and entered upon its records. The answer shall be filed by the member within 5 days after service of the charges upon him or her. If the person sought to be removed or reduced demands it, the civil service commission shall grant him or her a public hearing, which hearing shall be held within a period of 10 days after the filing of the charges in writing and a written answer thereto. Pending the period between the making of the charges as a basis for removal and the decision thereon by the commission, the member shall remain in office. At the hearing, the burden shall be upon the removing officer to justify his or her action. If the removing officer fails to make charges to the satisfaction of a member or members of a fire or police department in a city, village, or municipality, the member or members of the fire or police department may present the information to the civil service commission. If the civil service commission fails to justify the action of the removing officer, then the person sought to be removed shall be reinstated with full pay for the entire period during which time he or she may have been prevented from performing his or her usual employment, and no charges shall be officially recorded against his or her record. A written record of all testimony taken at the hearing shall be kept and preserved by the civil service commission, which record shall be sealed and not be made available for public inspection if an appeal is not taken from the action of the commission. If the civil service commission sustains the action of the removing officer, the person removed shall have an immediate right of appeal to the circuit court of the county in which the city, village, or municipality is situated. The appeal shall be taken within 90 days after the date the civil service commission enters its final order. If an appeal is made, the circuit court shall hear the appeal upon the original record, and additional proof shall not be offered into evidence. The circuit court's decision shall be final. However, the employee has the right to petition the supreme court for a review of the court's decision. The removing officer and the person sought to be removed at all times, both before the civil service commission and upon appeal, may employ counsel to represent either of them before the civil service commission and, upon appeal, before the circuit court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If for reasons of economy it shall be deemed necessary by any city, village, or municipality to reduce the number of full-time paid members of any fire or police department, the municipality shall follow the following procedure: Removals shall be accomplished by suspending in numerical order, commencing with the last employee appointed to the fire or police department, all recent appointees to the fire or police department until the reductions are made. However, if the fire or police department increases in numbers to the strength existing before the reductions were made, the fire fighters or police officers suspended last under this act shall be reinstated before any new appointments to the fire or police department are made.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 6.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Age and service retirement benefits payable under this act are as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A member who is 55 years of age or older and who has 25 or more years of service as a police officer or fire fighter in the employ of the municipality affected by this act may retire from service upon written application to the retirement board stating a date, not less than 30 days or more than 90 days after the execution and filing of the application, on which the member desires to be retired. The retirement board shall grant the benefits to which the member is entitled under this act, unless the member continues employment. If the member continues employment, the member's pension shall be deferred with service years of credit until actual retirement. Upon the approval of the legislative body or the electors of a municipality under this act, a member under 50 years of age who has 25 or more years of service, or without the necessity for approval, a member 50 years of age or more who has 25 or more years of service, may leave service and receive the full retirement benefits payable throughout the member's life as provided in subdivision (e).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A member who is 60 years of age or older shall be retired by the retirement board upon the written application of the legislative body, or board or official provided in the charter of the municipality as head of the department in which the member is employed. Upon retirement, the retirement board shall grant the benefits to which the member is entitled under this act, unless the member continues employment. If the member continues employment, the member's pension shall be deferred with service years of credit until actual retirement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A member who is 65 years of age shall be retired by the retirement board on the first day of the month following attainment of 65 years of age.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A member who has 10 or more years of service shall have vested retirement benefits that are not subject to forfeiture on account of disciplinary action, charges, or complaints. If the member leaves employment before the date the member would have first become eligible to retire as provided in subdivision (a) for any reason except the member's retirement or death, the member is entitled to a pension that shall begin the first day of the calendar month immediately after the month in which the member's written application for the pension is filed with the retirement board that is on or after the date the member would have been eligible to retire had the member continued in employment. The retirement board shall grant the member the benefits to which the member is entitled under this act, unless the member resumes service. If the member resumes service, the member's pension shall be further deferred with service years of credit until the member actually retires.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Upon retirement from service as provided in this subsection, a member shall receive a regular retirement pension payable throughout the member's life of 2% of the member's average final compensation multiplied by the first 25 years of service credited to the member, plus 1% of the member's average final compensation multiplied by the number of years, and fraction of a year, of service rendered by the member in excess of 25 years. A municipality under this act, upon approval of the legislative body or the electors of the municipality, may increase the percentage of the payment from 2% up to a maximum of 2.5%. If an increase is approved, the increase shall not be reduced for members under the system at the time of the increase. The legislative body may also increase the percentage of employee contributions. If a retired member dies before the total of regular pension payments received by the member equals the total of the member's contributions made to the retirement system, the difference between the member's total contributions and the total of the member's regular retirement pension payments received shall be paid in a single sum to the person or persons the member nominates by written designation duly executed and filed with the retirement board. If there is not a person or persons surviving the retired member, the difference, if any, shall be paid to the retired member's legal representative or estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   As used in this section, "average final compensation" means the average of the highest annual compensation received by a member during a period of 5 consecutive years of service contained within the member's 10 years of service immediately preceding the member's retirement or leaving service. However, if so provided in a collective bargaining agreement entered into between a municipality under this act and the appropriate recognized bargaining agent, average final compensation may mean the average of the 3 years of highest annual compensation received by a member during the member's 10 years of service immediately preceding the member's retirement or leaving service. If the member has less than 5 years of service, average final compensation means the annual average compensation received by the member during his or her total years of service.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   A member shall be given service credit for time spent in the military, naval, marine, or other armed service of the United States government during time of war, or other national emergency recognized by the board, if the member was employed by the municipality at the time of entry into the armed service, and is or was reemployed by the municipality as a police officer or fire fighter within 6 months after the date of termination of his or her required enlistment or assignment in the armed service. A municipality by a 3/5 vote of its governing body or by a majority vote of the qualified electors may provide service credit for not more than 6 years of active military service to the United States government to a member who is employed subsequent to this military service upon payment to the retirement system of 5% of the member's full-time or equated full-time compensation for the fiscal year in which payment is made multiplied by the years of service that the member elects to purchase up to the maximum. Service is not creditable if it is or would be creditable under any other federal, state, or local publicly supported retirement system. However, this restriction does not apply to those persons who have or will have acquired retirement eligibility under the federal government for service in the reserve. A member shall be given service credit for the time the member is absent from active service without full pay on account of sickness or injury. If the absence from active service is due to nonservice connected sickness or injury, not more than 60 days of the absence shall be credited as service in any 1 calendar year, as determined by the retirement board.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   Before the effective date of the member's retirement as provided in this subsection, but not after the effective date of the member's retirement, a member may elect to receive his or her benefit in a pension payable throughout the member's life, called a regular retirement pension, or the member may elect to receive the actuarial equivalent, computed as of the effective date of retirement, of the member's regular retirement pension in a reduced retirement pension payable throughout the member's life, and nominate a survivor beneficiary, under an option provided in this subdivision. Upon the death of a retirant who retires on or after July 1, 1975, and who is receiving a regular retirement pension, his or her spouse, if living, shall receive a pension equal to 60% of the regular retirement pension the deceased retirant was receiving. Benefits shall not be paid under this subdivision on account of the death of a retirant if the member elected to receive his or her pension under an option provided in this subdivision. As used in this subsection, "spouse" means the person to whom the retirant was legally married on both the effective date of retirement and the date of death. Except as otherwise provided in this act, if a member fails to elect an option before the effective date of retirement, then the pension shall be paid as a regular retirement pension. A member may elect 1 of the following options:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Option I. Upon the death of a retired member, his or her reduced retirement pension shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to the person, having an insurable interest in the retired member's life, that the member nominated by written designation executed and filed with the retirement board before the effective date of the member's retirement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Option II. Upon the death of a retired member, 1/2 of his or her reduced retirement pension shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to the person, having an insurable interest in the retired member's life, that the member nominated by written designation executed and filed with the retirement board before the effective date of the member's retirement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   If a member continues in service on or after the date of acquiring 20 years of service credit, does not have an option I election provided for in subdivision (j) in force, and dies while in service of the municipality before the effective date of the member's retirement, leaving a surviving spouse, the spouse shall receive a pension computed in the same manner as if the member had retired effective the day preceding the date of the member's death, elected option I provided for in subdivision (h), and nominated the spouse as survivor beneficiary. Upon the death of the spouse the pension shall terminate. A pension shall not be paid under this subdivision on account of the death of a member if benefits are paid under subsection (2) on account of the member's death.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)   A member who continues in service on or after the date of acquiring 25 years of service credit may, at any time before the effective date of the member's retirement, by written declaration executed and filed with the board in the manner and form prescribed by the board, elect option I provided for in subdivision (h) and nominate a survivor beneficiary whom the board finds to be dependent upon the member for at least 50% of the beneficiary's support. If a member who has an option I election provided for in this subdivision in force dies while in service before the effective date of the member's retirement, the member's survivor beneficiary shall immediately receive the same pension that the survivor beneficiary would have been entitled to receive under option I if the member had retired pursuant to this act effective the day preceding the date of the member's death, notwithstanding that the member may not have attained 55 years of age. If a member who has an option I election provided for in this subdivision in force subsequently retires pursuant to this act, the member, within 90 days immediately preceding the effective date of the member's retirement, but not after the effective date of the member's retirement, may elect an option provided for in subdivision (h). The option election is effective as of the effective date of the member's retirement. A pension shall not be paid under this subdivision on account of the death of a member if benefits are paid under subsection (2) on account of the member's death.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(k)   If a retirant receiving a reduced retirement pension under subdivision (h)(i) or (ii) is divorced from the spouse who had been named the retirant's survivor beneficiary under subdivision (h)(i) or (ii), the election of a reduced retirement pension payment option shall be considered void by the retirement system if the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, or an amended judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, described in section 9 and dated after June 27, 1991 provides that the election of a reduced retirement pension payment option under subdivision (h)(i) or (ii) is to be considered void by the retirement system and the retirant provides a certified copy of the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, or an amended judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, to the retirement system. If the election of a reduced retirement pension payment option under subdivision (h)(i) or (ii) is considered void by the retirement system under this subsection, the retirant's retirement pension shall revert to a regular retirement pension, including postretirement adjustments, if any, subject to an award or order of the court as described in the public employee retirement benefit protection act. The retirement pension shall revert to a regular retirement pension under this subdivision effective the first day of the month after the date the retirement system receives a certified copy of the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court. This subdivision does not supersede a judgment of divorce or award or order of the court in effect on June 27, 1991. This subdivision does not require the retirement system to distribute or pay retirement assets on behalf of a retirant in an amount that exceeds the actuarially determined amount that would otherwise become payable if a judgment of divorce had not been rendered.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Disability and service connected death benefits payable under this act are as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   To a surviving spouse, a duty death pension of the same amount each week as that which has been paid the surviving spouse under the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.101 to 418.941, to become due and payable on the termination of the payments to the surviving spouse by a municipality under the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.101 to 418.941, and to continue for the surviving spouse's life. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If death results to a member in the line of duty, and the member leaves surviving children, the children shall be paid a pension of the same amount as that which has been paid to them as a weekly benefit under the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.101 to 418.941, to become due and payable upon termination of the payments under the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.101 to 418.941, and to continue to each surviving child until he or she attains 18 years of age, or until his or her marriage or death before attaining 18 years of age.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If death results to a member in the line of duty and the member leaves other surviving dependents, the dependents shall receive a pension of the same amount as that which has been paid to them as a weekly benefit under the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.101 to 418.941, to become due and payable upon termination of the payments under the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.101 to 418.941, and to continue until the time the retirement board determines that the need for a pension no longer exists.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Upon the application of a member or the member's department head, a member who becomes totally incapacitated for duty by reason of a personal injury or disease occurring as the natural and proximate result of causes arising out of and in the course of the member's employment by the municipality shall be retired by the retirement board. The member shall be given a medical examination by a medical committee consisting of a physician named by the retirement board, a physician named by the member claiming benefits, and a third physician designated by the first 2 physicians named. The medical committee, if determined by a majority opinion, shall certify in writing that the member is mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty as a police officer or fire fighter in the service of the municipality; that the incapacity is likely to be permanent; and that the member should be retired. Upon retirement for disability as provided in this subdivision, a member who has not attained 55 years of age shall receive a disability retirement pension of 50% of the member's average final compensation, which shall be determined according to subsection (1)(f), and shall be payable until the member becomes 55 years of age. Upon becoming 55 years of age, the disabled member shall receive a disability retirement pension computed according to subsection (1)(e). In computing the disability retirement pension, the member shall be given service credit for the period of receipt of a disability retirement pension before attainment of 55 years of age. If a member retired after attaining 55 years of age on account of disability, as provided in this subdivision, the member shall receive a disability retirement pension computed according to subsection (1)(e), notwithstanding that the member may not have 25 years of service credit. The disability retirement pension provided for in this subdivision is subject to subdivisions (f) and (g).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Upon the application of a member or the member's department head, a member in service who has 5 or more years of service credit and who becomes totally and permanently incapacitated for duty by reason of a personal injury or disease occurring as the result of causes arising outside the course of the member's employment by the municipality may be retired by the retirement board. The member shall be given a medical examination by a medical committee consisting of a physician named by the retirement board, a physician named by the member claiming benefits, and a third physician designated by the first 2 physicians named. The medical committee, if determined by a majority opinion, shall certify in writing that the member is mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty as a police officer or fire fighter in the service of the municipality, that the incapacity is likely to be permanent, and that the member should be retired. Upon retirement for disability, as provided in this subdivision, a member who has not attained 55 years of age shall receive a disability retirement pension until the member becomes 55 years of age, recovers, or dies, whichever occurs first, of 1.5% of the member's average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of service credited to the member. Upon becoming 55 years of age, the member's disability retirement pension shall be increased to 2% of the member's average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of service credited to the member at the time of his or her retirement. Upon retirement for disability as provided in this subdivision, a member who is 55 years of age or older shall receive a disability retirement pension computed according to subsection (1)(e). This subdivision is subject to subdivisions (f) and (g).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   At least once each year during the first 5 years after the retirement of a member with a disability retirement pension and at least once in every 3-year period after disability retirement, the retirement board may, and upon the retired member's application shall, require a retired member who has not attained 55 years of age to undergo a medical examination. The medical examination shall be given by or under the direction of a physician, designated by the retirement board, at the place of residence of the retired member or other place mutually agreed upon. If a retired member who has not attained 55 years of age refuses to submit to the medical examination in the period, the member's disability retirement pension may be discontinued by the retirement board. If the member's refusal continues for 1 year, all the member's rights to his or her disability retirement pension may be revoked by the retirement board. If upon a medical examination of the retired member the physician reports to the retirement board that the retired member is physically capable of resuming employment in the classification held by the member at the time of retirement, the member shall be restored to active service in the employ of the municipality and payment of the disability retirement pension shall cease if the report of the physician is concurred in by the retirement board. A retired member restored to active service shall again become a member of the retirement system from the date of return to service. The member shall contribute to the retirement system after restoration to active service in the same manner as before the member's disability retirement. Service credited to the member at the time of disability retirement shall be restored to full effect. The member shall be given service credit for the period the member was receiving a duty disability retirement pension provided for in subdivision (d), but shall not be given service credit for the period the member was receiving a nonduty disability retirement pension provided for in subdivision (e). Amounts paid under the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.101 to 418.941, to a retired member shall be offset against and payable in place of benefits provided under this act. If the benefits under the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.101 to 418.941, are less than the benefits payable under this act, the amount to be paid out of the funds of the retirement system shall be the difference between the benefits provided under the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.101 to 418.941, and the benefits provided in this act. Upon the termination of benefits under the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.101 to 418.941, the benefits shall be paid pursuant to this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Within 60 days before a member becomes 55 years of age, or before retirement from service if retirement occurs after the member becomes 55 years of age, a disabled member who is retired as provided in subdivision (d) or (e) may elect to continue to receive a disability retirement pension as a benefit terminating at death, to be known as a regular disability pension, or may elect to receive the actuarial equivalent, at that time, of a regular disability pension in a reduced disability pension payable throughout life pursuant to an option provided in subsection (1)(h). If a disabled member fails to elect an option, as provided in this subdivision, before becoming 55 years of age or before retirement, the member's retirement pension shall be paid to the member as a regular disability pension terminating at death. If a disabled member who has not elected an option provided in subsection (1)(h) dies before the total of the member's regular disability pension payments received equals or exceeds the total of the member's contributions made to the retirement system, the remainder, if any, shall be paid in a single sum to the person or persons nominated by the member by written designation duly executed and filed with the board. If there is not a designated person or persons surviving, then the remainder, if any, shall be paid to the retired member's legal representative or estate.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For the purpose of creating and maintaining a fund for the payment of the pensions and other benefits payable as provided in this act, the municipality, subject to the provisions of this act, shall appropriate, at the end of such regular intervals as may be adopted, quarterly, semiannually, or annually, an amount sufficient to maintain actuarially determined reserves covering pensions payable or that might be payable on account of service performed and to be performed by active members, and pensions being paid to retired members and beneficiaries. The appropriations to be made by the municipality in any fiscal year shall be sufficient to pay all pensions due and payable in that fiscal year to all retired members and beneficiaries. The amount of the appropriation in a fiscal year shall not be less than 10% of the aggregate pay received during that fiscal year by members of the retirement system unless, by actuarial determination, it is satisfactorily established that a lesser percentage is needed. All deductions and appropriations shall be payable to the treasurer of the municipality and he or she shall pay the deductions and appropriations into the retirement system. Except in municipalities that are subject to the 15 mill tax limitation as provided by section 6 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963, the amount required by taxation to meet the appropriations to be made by municipalities under this act shall be in addition to any tax limitation imposed upon tax rates in those municipalities by charter provisions or by state law subject to section 25 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If, at the beginning or during any fiscal year, it has been satisfactorily determined by the retirement board that the accumulated funds of the retirement system plus the municipality's contribution of 10% of the aggregate pay received during that fiscal year by members of the retirement system plus members' contributions of 5% of payroll, are insufficient to pay all pensions and other benefits due and payable in that year out of funds of the retirement system, then all pensions and other benefits payable shall be prorated for the remainder of the fiscal year by the retirement board.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Any clerical, legal, actuarial, or medical expenses required by the retirement board, or any other necessary expense for the operation of the retirement system, shall be provided for by the municipality or shall be paid from the investment income of the retirement system, as determined by the governing body of the municipality. The retirement board shall submit expenses periodically to the governing body of the municipality. If use of investment income to pay these expenses causes an actuarial insufficiency in the assets of the retirement system used to pay pensions, the insufficiency shall be made up by the municipality.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   All pensions allowed and payable to retired members and beneficiaries under this act shall become obligations of and be payable from the funds of the retirement system.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The right of a person to a pension, to the return of member contributions, to any optional benefits, or any other right accrued or accruing to a member or beneficiary under this act and the money belonging to the retirement system is subject to the public employee retirement benefit protection act.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Employer's social security taxes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The employer's social security taxes covering members of the judges' retirement system, except judges of the recorder's court and common pleas court of Detroit, shall be paid by the state.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Payment of contributions, adjustment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Contributions so collected shall be paid into the contribution fund in partial discharge of the liability of such political subdivision under subsection (a). Failure to deduct such contributions shall not relieve the employee or employer of liability therefor.

With respect to the employees of any political subdivision, including a school district of the first class whose employees are members of the retirement system created by chapter 2 of Act No. 136 of the Public Acts of 1945, as amended, he shall authorize a referendum only upon joint petition of the governing body of such political subdivision or school district of the first class together with the governing body of the retirement system in which such employees have membership. In lieu of the governing body of the retirement system in which such employees have membership and/or if there is no such retirement system governing body, there may be substituted as joint petitioner with the governing body of such political subdivision a petition signed by not less than 20% of the employees in positions under consideration for old-age and survivors insurance coverage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The referendum shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of section 218 (d) (3) of title II of the social security act, by the retirement system governing body, or, if no such retirement system governing body, then by the governing body of the political subdivision under the supervision of the governor or any agency or individual designated by him on the question of whether service in positions covered by a retirement system established by the state or by a political subdivision thereof should be excluded from or included under an agreement under this act: Provided, That in the case of a retirement system that is part of the charter of the political subdivision, the plan shall be agreed to by action of the governing body of the political subdivision and by referendum of the employees as herein provided, before submission to the electorate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The notice of referendum required by section 218(d)(3)(c) of title II of the social security act to be given to employees shall be accompanied by, or shall, not less than 40 days prior to the referendum, be supplemented by a statement in such manner, form and detail as the agency or individual designated to supervise the referendum shall deem necessary and sufficient to inform the employees of the rights which will accrue to them and their dependents and survivors, and the liabilities to which they will be subject if their services are included under an agreement under this act. In case a 90 day period after notice of referendum shall lapse before changes in a retirement system shall have been enacted or approved as above provided, then the date of referendum shall be automatically extended to not less than 40 days after such enactment or adoption.</DIV>

Legislative service used to qualify for and receive a retirement allowance under the state employees' retirement act, 1943 PA 240, MCL 38.1 to 38.69, shall not be credited as service for the purpose of this act. A member who qualifies under section 6(b) or (c) may choose to have service credited under this act if the service would otherwise have qualified as service under the state employees' retirement act, 1943 PA 240, MCL 38.1 to 38.69, or if the service was to the state before 1943.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A member who has satisfied the requirements of section 23(1)(a) and who was drafted, enlisted, inducted, or commissioned into active duty with the armed forces of the United States government may elect to receive service credit for not more than 2 years of active duty upon proof of the service having been rendered and upon request and payment to the retirement system of an amount equal to 5% of the member's salary for the calendar year in which payment is made multiplied by the years including any fraction of a year of service that the member elects to purchase up to the maximum. A deferred vested member or retirant who has satisfied the requirements of section 23(1)(a) and who was drafted, enlisted, inducted, or commissioned into active duty with the armed forces of the United States may elect to receive service credit for not more than 2 years of active duty upon proof of the service having been rendered. A deferred vested member or retirant who is electing military service credit under this subsection shall pay an amount equal to 5% of the salary of a member who is serving at the time payment is made multiplied by the number of years including any fraction of a year of service for which the deferred vested member elects to receive credit. Service shall not be credited under this subsection if it is or would be credited under any other federal, state, or local publicly supported retirement system, but this restriction shall not apply to those persons who have or will have acquired retirement eligibility under the federal government for service in the reserve.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Membership in the retirement system created under this act shall not disqualify an employee of a political subdivision of this state from membership in a pension or retirement system established in the political subdivision of this state by reason of the compensation the employee receives from the political subdivision. Membership in the retirement system created under this act shall not affect the benefits to which a member, deferred vested member, retirant, or beneficiary may be entitled under the retirement system established in the political subdivision.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 20.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The members' retirement fund is created. The fund shall accumulate reserves for the payment of retirement allowances to retired members and deferred vested members as provided in this act. Upon the basis of mortality and other experience tables, and the prescribed rate of interest, as the board shall adopt, the actuary shall compute annually the amount of retirement reserves for retirement allowances being paid to retirants and covering service rendered and to be rendered by members. It is the intention of this act that the retirement reserves shall be financed by other revenues to the fund and that annual appropriations shall be determined pursuant to subsections (2), (3), and (4).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The state's appropriation for current service shall be an amount that, if paid annually during the future service of members, will be sufficient to provide the reserves at the time of the members' retirement, after allowing for the net contributions to the members' savings fund to be made by the members, for the future service portions of the retirement allowances to which the members might become entitled.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The state's appropriation for members' accrued service shall be an amount that if paid annually over a period of years determined by the board, but not to exceed 50 years, will amortize at the prescribed rate of interest the unfunded reserves for the accrued service portions of the retirement allowances to which the members may become entitled.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The state's appropriation for retirement allowances being paid from the members' retirement fund shall be an amount that if paid annually over a period of years determined by the board, but not to exceed 50 years, will amortize at the prescribed rate of interest the unfunded reserves for the retirement allowances.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, if the retirement board establishes an arrangement and fund as described in section 6 of the public employee retirement benefit preservation act, the benefits that are required to be paid from that fund shall be paid from a portion of the employer contributions described in this section or other eligible funds. The retirement board shall determine the amount of the employer contributions or other eligible funds that shall be allocated to that fund and deposit that amount in that fund before it deposits any remaining employer contributions or other eligible funds in the pension fund.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The members' savings fund is created in the retirement system. The retirement system shall accumulate in the members' savings fund the contributions made by members toward the financing of their retirement allowances, shall make transfers of those contributions from the members' savings fund to the members' retirement fund, and shall make refunds of contributions from the members' savings fund as provided in this act.

Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a member who first becomes a member after January 1, 1995, shall make contributions to the members' savings fund of 5% of each payment of salary received by the member for services as a member. Beginning on the effective date of section 36a, member contributions required under this subsection are suspended unless reinstated by the board under section 36a.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   During the period beginning on January 1, 1999 and ending on December 31, 2000, a member who first became a member after December 1, 1994 and on or before January 1, 1995, shall make additional member contributions to the members' savings fund of 4% of each payment of salary received by the member for services as a member.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The member contributions required by this section shall be made by payroll deductions. Each member is considered to consent and agree to the payroll deductions as a condition of membership in the retirement system.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Upon the retirement of a member, his or her accumulated contributions shall be transferred to the members' retirement fund. Upon the death of a member, if a survivor's retirement allowance becomes payable on account of the member's death, his or her accumulated contributions shall be transferred to the survivors' retirement fund.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The state's appropriation for survivors' retirement allowances to be paid upon the death of members, deferred vested members, and retirants shall be an amount that will provide the net reserves, after allowing for members' contributions to the survivors' retirement fund and transfers to be made to the fund from the members' savings fund, or other available funds for retirement allowances to be paid to survivors of members, deferred vested members, and retirants who will probably die during the next ensuing fiscal year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The state's appropriation for survivors' retirement allowances to be paid upon the death of retirants shall be an amount determined pursuant to the financing methods provided for in section 20(2) and (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The state's appropriation for survivors' retirement allowances being paid from the survivors' retirement fund shall be an amount that if paid annually over a period of years to be determined by the board, but not to exceed 50 years, will amortize at the prescribed rate of interest the unfunded reserves for the retirement allowances.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A member shall not be entitled to receive a retirement allowance provided for in this section or section 23d while serving as a legislator or lieutenant governor. Each person receiving benefits under this act consents and agrees as a condition of receiving the benefits that benefits of any nature shall not be paid while the person is a legislator or lieutenant governor.</DIV>

If the retirant has less than 8 years of service but qualifies by the election method, the retirement allowance shall be that proportion of 30% that his or her years of service and fraction of a year of service bears to 8 years. Years of service listed in the application need not be consecutive but shall have been rendered before payment of the retirement allowance. Except as provided in section 23c, a retirement allowance shall not exceed 60% of the salary stated in the application.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A member who retired after December 31, 1978 and before January 1, 1987, or a deferred vested member who left service after December 31, 1978 and before January 1, 1987, and becomes a retirant, shall be entitled to an annual retirement allowance of 32% of the salary stated in his or her application for the first 8 years of service plus 4% for each of the next 8 years of service.

Years of service listed in the application need not be consecutive, but shall have been rendered before payment of the retirement allowance. Except as provided in section 23c, a retirement allowance shall not exceed 64% of the salary stated in the application.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A member who first becomes a member on or before January 1, 1995 and who retires after December 31, 1986, or a deferred vested member who first becomes a member on or before January 1, 1995, who leaves service after December 31, 1986, and who becomes a retirant, shall be entitled to an annual retirement allowance of 20% of the salary stated in his or her application for the first 5 years of service plus 4% for each of the next 11 years of service. A fraction of a year of service in excess of 5 years shall be prorated. Years of service listed in the application need not be consecutive, but shall have been rendered before payment of the retirement allowance. Except as provided in this subsection and section 23c, a retirement allowance shall not exceed 64% of the salary stated in the application. Effective January 1, 1987, however, a member who first becomes a member on or before January 1, 1995 and who has 16 or more years of service shall also be entitled to a longevity allowance of 1.0% of the member's salary for each year of service beyond 16 years but, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, not to exceed 20 years. Except as provided in this subsection and section 23c, the retirement allowance of a member entitled to a longevity allowance under this subsection shall not exceed 68% of the salary stated in the application. Beginning January 1, 1989, a member who first becomes a member on or before January 1, 1995, who has 20 or more years of service, and who meets the age and service requirements or service requirements to be eligible to receive a retirement allowance under this act shall be entitled to a longevity allowance of 1.0% of the member's salary for each year of service beyond 20 years.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A member who first becomes a member on or after January 2, 1995 and who becomes a retirant under this act is entitled to an annual retirement allowance equal to the product of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The salary stated in his or her application.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Years and fraction of a year of service.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Three percent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A retirant who elects to purchase military service credit pursuant to section 11(2) shall have his or her retirement allowance recalculated to include the military service credit purchased pursuant to that section. The first payment of the recalculated retirement allowance shall be made effective with the first check after the recalculation is made.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The retirement allowance of a retirant who, on January 1, 1987, satisfied the conditions required by section 9(3) shall have his or her retirement allowance recalculated to reflect the increase in salary for those years permitted by section 9(3) before the member became a retirant.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   Within 30 days after becoming 55 years of age, a deferred vested member may elect to defer receipt of the retirement allowance to which the member is entitled under this act to a date certain, not to exceed 70-1/2 years of age. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, at the date the member designates to begin receipt of his or her retirement allowance, the member's retirement allowance shall be actuarially recomputed to reflect the member's age and life expectancy at initial receipt of the deferred retirement allowance. Upon request of the deferred vested member who elects to begin receiving his or her retirement allowance, the retirement board may pay to the member a lump sum payment of an amount equal to the sum of the retirement allowance that was deferred pursuant to this subsection. The retirement board shall not actuarially recompute the member's retirement allowance upon payment of a lump sum under this subsection. If a deferred vested member has elected to defer receipt of his or her retirement allowance under section 23(9)(a) and subsequently dies before retirement, 100% of his or her deferred benefit shall be paid in accordance with a beneficiary designation that the member shall have filed with the board.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   Notwithstanding subsection (1), a member or deferred vested member may retire with a retirement allowance computed according to the applicable provisions of this section if all of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The member or deferred vested member files a written application with the retirement board stating a date, not less than 30 nor more than 90 days after the execution and filing of the application, on which the member or deferred vested member desires to retire.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   On the last day of the month immediately preceding the retirement allowance effective date stated in the application, the member's or deferred vested member's combined age and length of credited service is equal to or greater than 70 years and the member or deferred vested member is 50 years of age or older.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   A member who retires before January 1, 1987 or a deferred vested member who leaves service before January 1, 1987 and becomes a retirant shall, in addition to the retirement allowance calculated under subsection (3) or (4), be entitled to a longevity allowance if the retirant or deferred vested member has more than 16 years of service. The longevity allowance is 1.0% of the former member's salary stated in the application for each year of service beyond 16 years but, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, not to exceed 20. A member who retires before January 1, 1987 or a deferred vested member who leaves service before January 1, 1987 and becomes a retirant shall, in addition to the retirement allowance calculated under subsection (3) or (4), be entitled to a longevity allowance of 1.0% of the former member's salary stated in the application for each year of service beyond 20 years that was served after the member met the age and service requirements or service requirements to be eligible to receive a retirement allowance under this act. The retirement allowance of a retirant who satisfies the conditions under this subsection shall have his or her retirement allowance recalculated to reflect the longevity allowance for those years permitted by this subsection effective January 1, 1987 or the date of retirement, whichever is later. The application of the longevity allowance to the retirant's retirement allowance under this subsection shall be applied before the provisions of section 23c are applied to that retirement allowance. Except as provided in this subsection and section 23c, a retirement allowance shall not exceed 68% of the salary stated in the application.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Unless otherwise provided by the member pursuant to this act, the surviving spouse of a deceased member, deferred vested member, or retirant having the service qualifications required by section 23 shall be entitled to receive a survivor's retirement allowance for life payable from the survivors' retirement fund. The survivor's retirement allowance shall be payable beginning on the day after the date of death of the member or deferred vested member, or beginning in the month after the month of death in the case of a retirant. If an eligible child or children also survive the member, deferred vested member, or retirant, and the child or children are under the care of the eligible surviving spouse, the survivor's retirement allowance shall begin as of the day after the date of death of the member or deferred vested member or the month after the month of death in the case of a retirant, without regard to whether the surviving spouse has attained 55 years of age. The benefits to an eligible child or children shall continue whether or not the surviving spouse remarries. If the eligible child or children, or any of them, are not under the care of the eligible surviving spouse, at the specific designation of the deceased member, deferred vested member, or retirant as provided in this act, a survivor's retirement allowance shall begin for the benefit of the eligible child or children as of the day after the date of death of the member or deferred vested member, or beginning in the month after the month of death in the case of a retirant. A deduction from the monthly survivor's retirement allowance shall not be made for any fraction of a month remaining at the time of a survivor's death or becoming ineligible.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The survivor's retirement allowance shall be equal to 66-2/3% of the retirement allowance which the deceased member, deferred vested member, or retirant had earned on the date of death, as a member, deferred vested member, or retirant. If an eligible survivor, regardless of age, has in his or her care an eligible child or children of the deceased member, deferred vested member, or retirant, the survivor's retirement allowance shall be 75% of the retirement allowance, but when all the children have become ineligible, the survivor's retirement allowance shall be 66-2/3% of the retirement allowance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An adopted child of a member for the purposes of this act shall have the same status as a natural child of a member.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If there is not a surviving spouse but an eligible child exists, or if an eligible child survives a surviving spouse, then the survivor's retirement allowance otherwise payable to the surviving spouse shall be paid in equal parts to each eligible child until the child becomes ineligible, and the total of the survivor's retirement allowance paid to any other child shall not be diminished because of the attainment of ineligible age, marriage, or death of an eligible child. The portion of the survivor's retirement allowance that was paid to a formerly eligible child who subsequently becomes ineligible shall be paid in equal parts among the remaining eligible children, if any, until no eligible children remain to be paid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Marriage or attainment of ineligible age, whichever occurs first, shall render a child of a member, deferred vested member, or retirant ineligible for further consideration in the payment of a survivor's retirement allowance or in the increase in the amount of the survivor's retirement allowance under this act.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) This section is enacted pursuant to section 401(a) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, that imposes certain administrative requirements and benefit limitations for qualified governmental plans. This state intends that the retirement system be a qualified pension plan created in trust under section 401 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, and that the trust be an exempt organization under section 501 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 501. The board of trustees shall administer the retirement system to fulfill this intent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the retirement system shall be administered in compliance with section 415 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, and regulations under that section that are applicable to governmental plans and beginning January 1, 2010, applicable portions of the final regulations issued by the internal revenue service on April 5, 2007. Employer-financed benefits provided by the retirement system under this act shall not exceed the applicable limitations of section 415 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, as adjusted by the commissioner of internal revenue under section 415(d) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, to reflect cost of living increases, and the retirement system shall adjust the benefits, including benefits payable to retirants and retirement allowance survivors, subject to the limitation each calendar year to conform with the adjusted limitation. For purposes of section 415(b) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, the applicable limitation shall apply to aggregated benefits received from all qualified pension plans for which the office of retirement services coordinates administration of that limitation. If there is a conflict between this section and another section of this act, this section prevails.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The assets of the retirement system shall be held in trust and invested for the sole purpose of meeting the legitimate obligations of the retirement system and shall not be used for any other purpose. The assets shall not be used for or diverted to a purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members, vested former members, retirants, and retirement allowance beneficiaries before satisfaction of all retirement system liabilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The retirement system shall return post-tax member contributions made by a member and received by the retirement system to a member upon retirement, pursuant to internal revenue service regulations and approved internal revenue service exclusion ratio tables.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The required beginning date for retirement allowances and other distributions shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee attains age 70-1/2 or April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee retires. The required minimum distribution requirements imposed by section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, shall apply to this act and be administered in accordance with a reasonable and good faith interpretation of the required minimum distribution requirements for all years to which the required minimum distribution requirements apply to this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the retirement system is terminated, the interest of the members, deferred vested members, retirants, and retirement allowance beneficiaries in the retirement system is nonforfeitable to the extent funded as described in section 411(d)(3) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 411(d)(3), and related internal revenue service regulations applicable to governmental plans.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act to the contrary that would limit a distributee's election under this act, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board of trustees, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) For purposes of determining actuarial equivalent retirement allowances under this act, the actuarially assumed interest rate shall be 7% with utilization of the 1971 group annuity and mortality table.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the compensation of a member of the retirement system shall be taken into account for any year under the retirement system only to the extent that it does not exceed the compensation limit established in section 401(a)(17) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401(a)(17), as adjusted by the commissioner of internal revenue. This subsection applies to any person who first becomes a member of the retirement system on or after October 1, 1996.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, contributions, benefits, and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided under the retirement system in accordance with section 414(u) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 414(u). This subsection applies to all qualified military service on or after December 12, 1994. Beginning January 1, 2007, in accordance with section 401(a)(37) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, if a member dies while performing qualified military service, for purposes of determining any death benefits payable under this act, the member will be treated as having resumed and then terminated employment on account of death.</div>

<P>Sec. 61.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The retirement system shall provide an opportunity for each member who is a member on March 30, 1997, to elect in writing to terminate membership in Tier 1 and elect to become a qualified participant in Tier 2. An election made by a member under this subsection is irrevocable. The retirement system shall accept written elections under this subsection from members during the period beginning on January 2, 1998 and ending on April 30, 1998. A member who does not make a written election or who does not file the election during the period specified in this subsection continues to be a member of Tier 1. A member who makes and files a written election under this subsection elects to do all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Cease to be a member of Tier 1 effective 12 midnight May 31, 1998.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Become a qualified participant in Tier 2 effective 12:01 a.m., June 1, 1998.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, waive all of his or her rights to a pension, an annuity, a retirement allowance, an insurance benefit, or any other benefit under this act effective 12 midnight May 31, 1998. This subdivision does not affect a person's right to health benefits provided under this act pursuant to section 79.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If an individual who was a deferred vested member on March 30, 1997, or an individual who was a former nonvested member on March 30, 1997 becomes a legislator or lieutenant governor and is again eligible for membership in Tier 1, the individual shall elect in writing to remain a member of Tier 1 or to terminate membership in Tier 1 and become a qualified participant in Tier 2. An election made by a deferred vested member or a former nonvested member under this subsection is irrevocable. The retirement system shall accept written elections under this subsection from a deferred vested member or a former nonvested member during the period beginning on the date of the individual's eligibility for membership and ending upon the expiration of 60 days after the date of that eligibility. A deferred vested member or former nonvested member who makes and files a written election to remain a member of Tier 1 retains all rights and is subject to all conditions as a member of Tier 1 under this act. A deferred vested member or former nonvested member who does not make a written election or who does not file the election during the period specified in this subsection continues to be a member of Tier 1. A deferred vested member or former nonvested member who makes and files a written election to terminate membership in Tier 1 elects to do all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Cease to be a member of Tier 1 effective 12 midnight on the last day of the payroll period that includes the date of the election.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Become a qualified participant in Tier 2 effective 12:01 a.m. on the first day of the payroll period immediately following the date of the election.</DIV>

This subdivision does not affect an individual's right to health benefits provided under this act pursuant to section 79.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   After consultation with the retirement system's actuary, the retirement board shall determine the method by which a member, deferred vested member, or former nonvested member shall make a written election under this section. If the member, deferred vested member, or former nonvested member is married at the time of the election, the election is not effective unless the election is signed by the individual's spouse. However, the retirement board may waive this requirement if the spouse's signature cannot be obtained because of extenuating circumstances.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   An election under this section is subject to the eligible domestic relations order act, 1991 PA 46, MCL 38.1701 to 38.1711.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the board receives notification from the United States internal revenue service that this section or any portion of this section will cause the retirement system to be disqualified for tax purposes under the internal revenue code, then the portion that will cause the disqualification does not apply.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 62.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   For a member who elects to terminate membership in Tier 1 under section 61(1), the retirement system shall direct the state treasurer to transfer a lump sum amount from the appropriate fund created under this act to the qualified participant's account in Tier 2 on or before September 30, 1998. The retirement system shall calculate the amount to be transferred, which shall be equal to the sum of the following:</DIV>

Except as provided in subsection (5), for the purposes of this subsection, the present value of the member's accumulated benefit obligation is based upon the member's estimated credited service and estimated final salary as of 12 midnight on May 31, 1998.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)   Age 55.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(B)   The member's age, if the member is at least 50 years old and the sum of his or her age and estimated credited service equals or exceeds 70.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Interest on any amounts determined in subdivisions (a) and (b), from June 1, 1998 to the date of the transfer, based upon 8% annual interest, compounded annually.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For each member who elects to terminate membership in the retirement system under section 61(1), the retirement system shall recompute the amount transferred under subsection (1) not later than November 30, 1998 based upon the member's actual credited service and actual final salary as of 12 midnight May 31, 1998. If the recomputed amount differs from the amount transferred under subsection (1) by $10.00 or more, not later than December 15, 1998, the retirement system shall do all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Direct the state treasurer to transfer from the members' retirement fund to the qualified participant's account in Tier 2 the excess, if any, of the recomputed amount over the previously transferred amount together with interest from 12 midnight May 31, 1998 to the date of the transfer under this subsection, based upon 8% effective annual interest, compounded annually.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   For a deferred vested member who elects to terminate membership in this retirement system under section 61(2), the retirement system shall direct the state treasurer to transfer a lump sum amount from the appropriate fund created under this act to the qualified participant's account in Tier 2 on or before the expiration of 60 days after the date of the individual's termination of employment. The retirement system shall calculate the amount to be transferred, which shall be equal to the sum of the following:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   For each deferred vested member who elects to terminate membership in Tier 1 under section 61(2), the retirement system shall recompute the amount transferred under subsection (3) not later than the expiration of 90 days after the transfer occurs under subsection (3) based upon the deferred vested member's actual credited service and actual final salary as of 12 midnight on the last day of the payroll period that includes the date of the election. If the recomputed amount differs from the amount transferred under subsection (3) by $10.00 or more, the retirement system shall do all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Direct the state treasurer to transfer from the members' retirement fund to the qualified participant's account in Tier 2 the excess, if any, of the recomputed amount over the previously transferred amount together with interest from 12 midnight on the last day of the payroll period that includes the date of the election to the date of the transfer under this subsection, based upon 8% effective annual interest, compounded annually.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Direct the state treasurer to transfer from the qualified participant's account in Tier 2 to the members' retirement fund the excess, if any, of the previously transferred amount over the recomputed amount, together with interest, from the date of the transfer made under subsection (3), based upon 8% effective annual interest, compounded annually.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   For the purposes of subsections (1) to (4), the calculation of estimated and actual present value of the member's or deferred vested member's accumulated benefit obligation shall be based upon methods adopted by the retirement system's actuary in consultation with the retirement board. The retirement system shall utilize the same actuarial valuation report used to calculate the amount transferred under subsection (1) or (3) when making the recomputation required under subsection (2) or (4). Estimated and actual final salary shall be determined as provided in section 9 as of 12 midnight on the date the member or deferred member ceases to be a member of Tier 1 under section 61.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   For a former nonvested member who elects to terminate membership in Tier 1 under section 61(2) and who has accumulated contributions standing to his or her credit in the members' savings fund, the retirement system shall direct the state treasurer to transfer a lump sum amount from the members' savings fund to the qualified participant's account in Tier 2 on or before the expiration of 60 days after the date of the individual's election to terminate membership. The retirement system shall calculate the amount to be transferred, which shall be equal to the sum of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The former nonvested member's accumulated contributions and applicable interest, if any, from the members' savings fund as of 12 midnight on the last day of the payroll period that includes the date of the election.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Interest on any amounts determined in subdivision (a), from the first day of the payroll period immediately following the date of the election to the date of the transfer, based upon 8% effective annual interest, compounded annually.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If the board receives notification from the United States internal revenue service that this section or any portion of this section will cause the retirement system to be disqualified for tax purposes under the internal revenue code, then the portion that will cause the disqualification does not apply.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The fiduciary shall immediately determine the companies on the scrutinized companies list in which the fiduciary oversees pursuant to its responsibilities as defined in subsection (1)(f).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Any progress made under subsection (5)(h).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) This section is effective until the first occurrence of any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The United States Congress or the President of the United States declares that the Darfur genocide has been halted for at least 12 months.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The United States revokes all sanctions imposed against the government of Sudan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The Congress or President of the United States declares that the government of Sudan has honored its commitments to cease attacks on civilians, demobilize and demilitarize the Janjaweed and associated militias, grant free and unfettered access for deliveries of humanitarian assistance, and allow for the safe and voluntary return of refugees and internally displaced persons.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The Congress or President of the United States, through legislation or executive order, declares that mandatory divestment of the type provided for in this act interferes with the conduct of United States foreign policy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) With respect to actions taken in compliance with this section, including all good faith determinations regarding companies as required by this section, the fiduciary shall be exempt from any conflicting statutory or common law obligations, including any obligations in respect to choice of asset managers, investment funds, or investments for the fiduciary's securities portfolios.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The fiduciary, members of an investment advisory committee, and any person with decision-making authority with regard to investments of the fiduciary shall not be held liable for any action undertaken for the purpose of complying with or executing the mandates required under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Scrutinized company does not include a company that the federal government has affirmatively excluded from federal sanctions for business the scrutinized company conducts relating to Sudan, or that has consistently obtained applicable licenses or approvals to conduct transactions with Sudan. If the fiduciary becomes aware at any time that a company that has not been affirmatively excluded from federal sanctions for business it conducts relating to Sudan and has not received from the United States government applicable licenses or approvals to conduct transactions with Sudan, that company is immediately subject to subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If any provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this legislation or its application to any person or circumstance is found to be invalid, illegal, unenforceable, or unconstitutional, the same is hereby declared to be severable and the balance of this legislation shall remain effective and functional notwithstanding such invalidity, illegality, unenforceability, or unconstitutionality.</div>

The fiduciary shall make the scrutinized companies list freely available to the fiduciaries of other public retirement systems located in this state if making the list available does not violate any agreements with third parties or reveal proprietary information of a third party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The fiduciary shall adhere to the following procedure for companies on the scrutinized companies list:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The fiduciary shall immediately determine the companies on the scrutinized companies list in which the fiduciary oversees pursuant to its responsibilities as described in subsection (1)(e).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For each company identified in subdivision (a) with only inactive business operations, not later than 60 days after the identification of the company, the fiduciary shall send a written notice informing the company of this section and encourage the company to continue to refrain from initiating active business operations in Iran until it is able to avoid scrutinized business operations. The fiduciary shall continue the correspondence on a semiannual basis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For each company newly identified in subdivision (a) with active business operations, not later than 60 days after the company is newly identified, the fiduciary shall send a written notice informing the company of its scrutinized company status and that it may become subject to divestment by the fiduciary. The notice shall offer the company the opportunity to clarify its Iran-related activities and shall encourage the company, within 90 days, to either cease its scrutinized business operations through substantial action or convert such operations to inactive business operations in order to avoid qualifying for divestment by the fiduciary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If, within 90 days following the fiduciary's first engagement with a company pursuant to subdivision (c), that company announces a plan of substantial action, the company shall be removed from the scrutinized companies list and this section shall cease to apply to it unless it fails to implement its plan of substantial action within the designated time frame. If, within 90 days following the fiduciary's first engagement, the company converts its active business operations to inactive business operations, the company shall be subject to this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If, after 90 days following the fiduciary's first engagement with a company pursuant to subdivision (c), the company continues to have active business operations, and only while the company continues to have active business operations, the fiduciary shall sell, redeem, divest, or withdraw all publicly traded securities of the company, according to the following schedule:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) At least 50% of the assets shall be removed from the fiduciary's assets under management within 9 months after the company's most recent appearance on the scrutinized companies list.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) 100% of the assets shall be removed from the fiduciary's assets under management within 15 months after the company's most recent appearance on the scrutinized companies list.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Except as provided in subdivisions (g) and (h), at no time shall the fiduciary acquire securities of companies on the scrutinized companies list that have active business operations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) No company which the United States government affirmatively declares to be excluded from its present or any future federal sanctions regime relating to Iran shall be subject to divestment or investment prohibition pursuant to subdivisions (e) and (f).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Subdivisions (e) and (f) shall not apply to indirect holdings in actively managed investment funds. For purposes of this section, actively managed investment funds include private equity funds and publicly traded funds. Before the fiduciary invests in a new private equity fund or publicly traded fund that is not in the fiduciary's portfolio as of July 17, 2008, the fiduciary shall perform due diligence to prevent investment in any private equity fund or publicly traded fund where the offering memorandum or prospectus identifies a purpose of the private equity fund or publicly traded fund as investing in scrutinized companies with active business operations in Iran. The fiduciary is not required to identify holdings in private equity funds or submit engagement letters to those funds. If the manager of a publicly traded, actively managed fund that is in the fiduciary's portfolio on July 17, 2008 creates a similar publicly traded, actively managed fund with indirect holdings devoid of identified scrutinized companies with scrutinized active business operations as defined in this section, the fiduciary shall replace all applicable investments with investments in the similar fund in an expedited time frame consistent with prudent investment standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The fiduciary shall file a publicly available report to the legislature that includes the scrutinized companies list within 30 days after the list is created. Annually thereafter, the fiduciary shall file a publicly available report to the legislature that includes all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A summary of correspondence with companies engaged by the fiduciary under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) All investments sold, redeemed, divested, or withdrawn in compliance with this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) All prohibited investments under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Any progress made under subsection (5)(h).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) This section is no longer effective upon the occurrence of 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The Congress or President of the United States affirmatively and unambiguously states, through legislation, executive order, or written certification from the President to Congress, that the government of Iran has ceased to acquire weapons of mass destruction and support international terrorism.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The United States revokes all sanctions imposed against the government of Iran.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The Congress or President of the United States affirmatively and unambiguously states, through legislation, executive order, or written certification from the President to Congress, that mandatory divestment of the type provided for in this section interferes with the conduct of United States foreign policy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) With respect to actions taken in compliance with this section, including all good faith determinations regarding companies as required by this section, the fiduciary shall be exempt from any conflicting statutory or common law obligations, including any obligations in respect to choice of asset managers, investment funds, or investments for the fiduciary's securities portfolios.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The fiduciary, members of an investment advisory committee, and any person with decision-making authority with regard to investments of the fiduciary shall not be held liable for any action undertaken for the purpose of complying with or executing the mandates required under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Scrutinized company does not include a company that the federal government has affirmatively excluded from federal sanctions for business the scrutinized company conducts relating to Iran, or that has consistently obtained applicable licenses or approvals to conduct transactions with Iran. If the fiduciary becomes aware at any time that a company that has not been affirmatively excluded from federal sanctions for business it conducts relating to Iran and has not received from the United States government applicable licenses or approvals to conduct transactions with Iran, that company is immediately subject to subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If any provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this legislation or its application to any person or circumstance is found to be invalid, illegal, unenforceable, or unconstitutional, the same is hereby declared to be severable and the balance of this legislation shall remain effective and functional notwithstanding such invalidity, illegality, unenforceability, or unconstitutionality.</div>

The required employer contribution is the actuarially determined contribution amount. An annual required employer contribution in a system under this act shall consist of a current service cost payment and a payment of at least the annual accrued amortized interest on any unfunded actuarial liability and the payment of the annual accrued amortized portion of the unfunded principal liability. For fiscal years that begin before January 1, 2006, the required employer contribution shall not be determined using an amortization period greater than 40 years.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The reserve for health benefits is the account to which payments of reporting units for health benefits are credited. Benefits payable pursuant to section 91 shall be paid from the reserve for health benefits. The assets and any earnings on the assets contained in the reserve for health benefits and the health advance funding subaccount are not to be treated as pension assets for any purpose.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The health advance funding subaccount is the account to which amounts transferred pursuant to section 41 are credited.

The department may expend funds or transfer funds to another account to expend for health benefits under section 91 if the actuarial accrued liability for health benefits under section 91 is at least 100% funded. For each fiscal year that begins after the first fiscal year in which the actuarial accrued liability for health benefits under section 91 is at least 100% funded by the health advance funding subaccount, the amounts may be expended or credited to fund health benefits provided under section 91 as provided in section 41(2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the department may transfer amounts from the health advance funding subaccount to the reserve for employer contributions established in section 30 if the department does both of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   At least 45 days before the intended transfer, submits a request to the chairs of the senate and house appropriations committees and, at least 15 days before the intended transfer, obtains the approval of both the senate and house appropriations committees.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Ensures that the request submitted to the senate and house appropriations committees contains an actuarial valuation prepared pursuant to section 41 that demonstrates that as of the beginning of a fiscal year, and after all credits and transfers required by this act for the previous fiscal year have been made, the sum of the actuarial value of assets and the actuarial present value of future normal cost contributions does not exceed the actuarial present value of benefits.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, the reserve for undistributed investment income is the account to which all income from the investment of assets, all gifts and bequests received by the retirement system, and all other money received by the retirement system the disposition of which is not specifically provided for is credited. The retirement board shall determine the income, interest, and dividends attributable to the health advance funding subaccount created by section 34(2). The income, interest, and dividends attributable to the health advance funding subaccount shall be credited to the health advance funding subaccount. In each fiscal year, the retirement board shall transfer from the reserve for undistributed investment income all amounts necessary to credit the interest required under this act to the reserve for employee contributions, the reserve for employer contributions, the reserve for member investment plan, the reserve for retired benefit payments, and the reserve for health benefits, to fund the reserve for administrative expenses, and any supplemental payments required pursuant to section 104a.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The pension stabilization subaccount is the account to which the amounts transferred pursuant to subsection (3) to the reserve for undistributed investment income are credited. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no amounts shall be transferred from the stabilization subaccount to any other reserve. The director of the department may transfer part or all of the pension stabilization subaccount to the reserve for employer contributions. After the department has transferred the entire balance of the pension stabilization subaccount to the reserve for employer contributions created by section 30, the pension stabilization subaccount created by this subsection shall be closed and subsection (3) shall no longer apply.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The annual level percentage of payroll contribution rates to finance benefits being provided and to be provided by the retirement system must be determined by actuarial valuation under subsection (2) on the basis of the risk assumptions that the retirement board and the department adopt after consultation with the state treasurer and an actuary. An annual actuarial valuation must be made of the retirement system to determine the actuarial condition of the retirement system and the required contribution to the retirement system. An annual actuarial gain-loss experience study of the retirement system must be made to determine the financial effect of variations of actual retirement system experience from projected experience.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in sections 41a and 41b, the annual contribution rates for benefits are subject to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the contribution rate for benefits must be computed using an individual projected benefit entry age normal cost method of valuation. If the contributions described in section 43e are determined by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction for which all rights of appeal have been exhausted to be unconstitutional and the contributions are not deposited into the appropriate funding account referenced in section 43e, the contribution rate for health benefits provided under section 91 must be computed using a cash disbursement method. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Subject to subdivision (c), the contribution rate for service likely to be rendered in the current year, the normal cost contribution rate, for reporting units must be determined as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Calculate the aggregate amount of individual projected benefit entry age normal costs. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Divide the result of the calculation under subparagraph (i) by 1% of the aggregate amount of active members' valuation compensation. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Except for the employee portion of the normal cost contribution rates for members under section 41b(2), beginning with the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 and for each subsequent fiscal year, the normal cost contribution rate must not be less than the normal cost contribution rate in the immediately preceding state fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Subject to subdivision (e), the contribution rate for unfunded service rendered before the valuation date, the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution rate, must be determined as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Calculate the aggregate amount of unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities of reporting units as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) Calculate the actuarial present value of benefits for members attributable to reporting units.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) Calculate the actuarial present value of future normal cost contributions of reporting units.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(C) Calculate the actuarial present value of assets on the valuation date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(D) Add the results of sub-subparagraphs (B) and (C).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(E) Subtract from the result of the calculation under sub-subparagraph (A) the result from the calculation under sub-subparagraph (D).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Subject to subsection (18), divide the result of the calculation under subparagraph (i) by 1% of the actuarial present value over a period not to exceed 50 years of projected valuation compensation. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Except for the employee portion of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution rates for members under section 41b(2), beginning with the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 and for each subsequent fiscal year until the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2021, the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution rate must not be less than the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution rate in the preceding state fiscal year. Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, beginning with the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, and for each subsequent fiscal year until the unfunded actuarial accrued liability is fully paid, the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution amount due and payable must not be less than the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution amount due and payable in the preceding state fiscal year. For a reporting unit that is a university reporting unit, for the state fiscal years ending September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution due and payable must be equal to the actuarially determined contribution. For a reporting unit that is a university reporting unit, for the state fiscal years ending September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, the contribution must reflect the appropriations made under section 236h of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1836h, as amended by 2022 PA 144 and 2023 PA 103.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Beginning with the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2013 and for each subsequent fiscal year, the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution rate applied to payroll must not exceed 20.96% for a reporting unit that is not a university reporting unit. Any additional unfunded actuarial accrued liability contributions as determined under this section for each fiscal year are to be paid by appropriation from the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963. Except as otherwise provided in this section and sections 41a and 41b, the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution rate must be based on and applied to the combined payrolls of the employees who are members or qualified participants, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Beginning with the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2016 and for each subsequent state fiscal year, the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution rate applied to the combined payroll, as provided in section 41a, must not exceed 25.73% for a university reporting unit. Any additional unfunded actuarial accrued liability contributions as determined under this section for each fiscal year for university reporting units are to be paid by appropriation under article III of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1836 to 388.1891.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Before November 1 of each state fiscal year, the executive secretary of the retirement board shall certify to the director of the department the aggregate compensation estimated to be paid public school employees for the state fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) On the basis of the estimate under subsection (3), the annual actuarial valuation, and any adjustment required under subsection (6), the director of the department shall compute the amount due and payable to the retirement system and shall certify this amount to the reporting units.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as provided in section 41b, the reporting units shall pay the amount certified under subsection (4) to the director of the department in equal payroll cycle installments for unfunded actuarial accrued liability contributions and payroll cycle installments for normal cost contributions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Not later than 90 days after the end of each state fiscal year, the executive secretary of the retirement board shall certify to the director of the department and each reporting unit the actual aggregate compensation paid to public school employees during the preceding state fiscal year. On receipt of that certification, the director of the department may compute any adjustment required to the amount because of a difference between the estimated and the actual aggregate compensation and the estimated and the actual actuarial employer contribution rate. The difference, if any, must be paid as provided in subsection (9). This subsection does not apply in a fiscal year in which a deposit is made under subsection (14).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The director of the department may require evidence of correctness and may conduct an audit of the aggregate compensation that the director of the department considers necessary to establish its correctness.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A reporting unit shall forward employee and employer Social Security contributions and reports as required by the federal old-age, survivors, disability, and hospital insurance provisions of title II of the social security act, 42 USC 401 to 434.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) For an employer of an employee of a local public school district or an intermediate school district, for differences occurring in fiscal years beginning on or after October 1, 1993, a minimum of 20% of any difference between the estimated and the actual aggregate compensation and the estimated and the actual actuarial employer contribution rate described in subsection (6) must be paid by that employer in the next state fiscal year and a minimum of 25% of the remaining difference must be paid by that employer in each of the following 4 state fiscal years, or until 100% of the remaining difference is submitted, whichever first occurs. For an employer of other public school employees, for differences occurring in fiscal years beginning on or after October 1, 1991, a minimum of 20% of any difference between the estimated and the actual aggregate compensation and the estimated and the actual actuarial employer contribution rate described in subsection (6) must be paid by that employer in the next state fiscal year and a minimum of 25% of the remaining difference must be paid by that employer in each of the following 4 state fiscal years, or until 100% of the remaining difference is submitted, whichever first occurs. In addition, interest must be included for each year that a portion of the remaining difference is carried forward. The interest rate must equal the actuarially assumed rate of investment return for the state fiscal year in which payment is made. This subsection does not apply in a fiscal year in which a deposit is made under subsection (14).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Beginning on September 30, 2006, all assets held by the retirement system must be reassigned their fair market value, as determined by the state treasurer, as of September 30, 2006, and in calculating any unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities, any market gains or losses incurred before September 30, 2006 may not be considered by the retirement system's actuaries.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, beginning on September 30, 2006, the actuary used by the retirement board shall assume a rate of return on investments of 8% per annum, as of September 30, 2006, which rate may only be changed with the approval of the retirement board and the director of the department. Beginning on July 1, 2010, the actuary used by the retirement board shall assume a rate of return on investments of 7% per annum for investments associated with members who first became members after June 30, 2010, and before February 1, 2018, which rate may only be changed with the approval of the retirement board and the director of the department. Beginning on February 1, 2018, the actuary used by the retirement board shall assume a rate of return on investments of 6% per annum for investments associated with members who first became a member on or after February 1, 2018, which rate may only be changed with the approval of the retirement board and the director of the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Beginning on September 30, 2006, the value of assets used must be based on a method that spreads over a 5-year period the difference between actual and expected return occurring in each year after September 30, 2006, and the methodology may only be changed with the approval of the retirement board and the director of the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Beginning on September 30, 2006, the actuary used by the retirement board shall use a salary increase assumption that projects annual salary increases of 4%. In addition to the 4%, the retirement board shall use an additional percentage based on an age-related scale to reflect merit, longevity, and promotional salary increase. The actuary shall use this assumption until a change in the assumption is approved in writing by the retirement board and the director of the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) For fiscal years that begin on or after October 1, 2001, if the actuarial valuation prepared under this section demonstrates that as of the beginning of a fiscal year, and after all credits and transfers required by this act for the previous fiscal year have been made, the sum of the actuarial value of assets and the actuarial present value of future normal cost contributions exceeds the actuarial present value of benefits, the amount based on the annual level percent of payroll contribution rate under subsections (1) and (2) may be deposited into the health advance funding subaccount created by section 34.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, if the retirement board establishes an arrangement and fund as described in section 6 of the public employee retirement benefit protection act, 2002 PA 100, MCL 38.1686, the benefits that are required to be paid from that fund must be paid from a portion of the employer contributions described in this section or other eligible money. The retirement board shall determine the amount of the employer contributions or other eligible money that must be allocated to that fund and deposit that amount in that fund before it deposits any remaining employer contributions or other eligible money in the pension fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) The retirement board and the department shall conduct and review an experience investigation study and adopt risk assumptions on which actuarial valuations are to be based after consultation with the actuary and the state treasurer. The experience investigation study must be completed and risk assumptions must be periodically reviewed at least once every 5 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) Every April 1 following the periodic review of risk assumptions under subsection (16), the office of retirement services on behalf of the department and the state treasurer shall collaborate to submit a report to the senate majority leader, the speaker of the house of representatives, the senate and house of representatives appropriations committees, and the senate and house fiscal agencies. A report required under this subsection must be published on the office of retirement services' website and include at least all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Forecasted rate of return on investments at all of the following probability levels:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) 5%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) 25%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) 50%.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Payroll growth assumptions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Any other assumptions that have a material impact on the financial status of the retirement system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, for members who first became members before February 1, 2018, for the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, the pension and retiree health care payroll growth assumption rate for a reporting unit that is not a university reporting unit must be 0.75%. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, for members who first became members before February 1, 2018, beginning with the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2025, and for each subsequent state fiscal year until the pension and retiree health care payroll growth assumption rate for a reporting unit that is not a university reporting unit is zero, the payroll growth assumption rate for a reporting unit that is not a university reporting unit must be reduced by 50 basis points. Beginning with the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2025 and for each subsequent state fiscal year until the rate described in this subsection is zero, if the pension and retiree health care unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution amount directly attributable to the 50 basis points reduction under this subsection for the fiscal year is 7% or more of the pension and retiree health care unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution amount in the preceding state fiscal year, the office of retirement services may reduce the rate described in this subsection by 25 basis points in that current fiscal year instead of the 50 basis point reduction described in this subsection. Beginning with the fiscal year ending September 30, 2022 and for each subsequent state fiscal year until the rate described in this subsection is zero, the office of retirement services and the retirement board may agree to reduce the rate described in this subsection by any number of additional basis points.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) As used in this section, "university reporting unit" means a reporting unit that is a university listed in the definition of public school employee under section 6.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) For fiscal years that begin after March 27, 1996, the retirement system shall determine a separate contribution rate for a university reporting unit. Subject to this subsection, the retirement system shall determine the separate contribution rate in the manner prescribed in section 41, except that the unfunded actuarial accrued liability must be amortized over 40 years beginning October 1, 1996 and ending on September 30, 2036, with the payment schedule for universities being based on and applied to the combined payrolls of the universities' employees who are members and who were hired before January 1, 1996 and the universities' employees who would have been members after December 31, 1995, but for the enactment of 1995 PA 272. Beginning with the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2016 and for each subsequent fiscal year, the combined payrolls used for the payment schedule for the university reporting units must include each university reporting unit's combined payroll, as projected by the actuary based on the actuarial valuation for each following fiscal year, except that the combined payroll for each university reporting unit must not be less than the combined payroll projected for each subsequent fiscal year for each university reporting unit by the actuary based on the September 30, 2012 actuarial valuation. The amount of the unfunded accrued liability on which the separate contribution rate is determined must be that amount which a university reporting unit is legally responsible for and is calculated by actuarial analysis. Any reduction in the unfunded liability of the system under governmental action affecting the entire system will be allocated to all reporting units including universities as determined by the system's actuary. For the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, the contribution for unfunded actuarial accrued liability must be equal to 4.5% of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability.</div>

If any section or part of a section of this act is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional, the holding does not affect the validity of the remaining sections of this act or the act in its entirety."<BR><B>Popular Name:</B> Act 300</p>
</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>38.1342 Reporting unit contribution; exclusive obligation; contributions picked up by employer; deduction of Social Security contributions; agreement of member; forwarding retirement contributions; report; failure to submit report or contributions; late fee; intentional error or omission; withholding payment of state funds for noncompliance; exception for community or junior college student employee; "intentional" defined.</B><P>Sec. 42.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Beginning with the state fiscal year ending September 30, 1995 and subject to section 41b, a reporting unit shall contribute the entire amount determined under section 41 to the reserve for employer contributions and to the reserve for health benefits. The reporting unit contribution under this subsection is the exclusive obligation of the reporting unit payable out of general budget resources of the reporting unit, including funds available under local millage and other local resources and from the state school aid allocation to the reporting unit, and is not a separate obligation by specific reimbursement or otherwise of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) As authorized by resolution or other enabling act of its governing body, the employer shall pick up all contributions of a member made under section 43a for all compensation paid after December 31, 1986 and reported to the retirement system. Although considered contributions of a member for certain purposes under this act, all contributions picked up must be treated as paid by the employer in lieu of contributions by the employee. Contributions picked up as provided in this subsection must be paid from the same source of funds that is used for paying compensation to the member. The employer may pick up these contributions by either a reduction to the member's cash salary, an offset against a future salary increase, or a combination of a reduction in salary and offset against a future salary increase. This subsection does not apply, and the employer shall not deduct, offset, or remit contributions, until the department receives notification from the United States Internal Revenue Service that contributions picked up will not be included as gross income of the member until they are distributed or made available to the member, retirant, retirement allowance beneficiary, or refund beneficiary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The employer shall deduct from a member's compensation the contributions for Social Security provided in 1951 PA 205, MCL 38.851 to 38.871.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Each reporting unit official shall forward the entire employer contribution required by this act to the retirement system on a schedule and in a manner determined by the retirement system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Each reporting unit official shall submit to the retirement system a report that includes the information for retirement purposes, including, but not limited to, persons employed, retirants performing services at a reporting unit who are employed by an entity other than the reporting unit or who are independent contractors, wages or amounts paid, hours, and contributions required under this act. The report must include the information on a pay period basis and must be submitted to the retirement system on a schedule and in a manner determined by the retirement system.

If the remittance of contributions is late, the late fee must include interest for each day that the remittance of contributions is late. The retirement board periodically may establish the late fee, which must not be less than $25.00, and interest charges, which must not be less than 6% per annum.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Subject to subsection (9), if a reporting unit fails to correct errors on a report before the errors are discovered by the retirement system or if the errors are intentional, the reporting unit shall pay the late fee and interest charges as described in subsection (7) for each day that the report is in error, unless reasonable cause is shown to the satisfaction of the retirement system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the retirement board determines that a reporting unit has committed an intentional error or omission that includes a failure to submit contributions required by this act, the total assessment of daily late fees and daily interest charges under subsection (8) must not exceed the reporting unit's delinquent contribution balance associated with the error or omission, or the reporting unit's employer contribution balance for the previous school fiscal year, whichever is less. Subject to subsection (11), if the retirement board determines that a reporting unit has committed an intentional error or omission that does not include a failure to submit contributions required by this act, the total assessment of daily late fees and daily interest charges under subsection (8) must not exceed 100% of the reporting unit's employer contributions for the previous school fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) On written notice from the retirement board, the superintendent of public instruction and the state treasurer shall withhold payment of state funds, in part or in whole, payable from the state school aid appropriation or higher education appropriations to a reporting unit that fails to comply with this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Errors or omissions relating to the reporting of service rendered by an individual employed by a tax supported community or junior college while enrolled as a part-time student in that same tax supported community or junior college for a school fiscal year before the 2018-2019 school fiscal year are not subject to the assessment of daily late fees and daily interest penalties under subsection (8) but are subject to the payment of regular late fees and regular interest under subsection (7).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) As used in this section, an "intentional" error or omission includes, but is not limited to, the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A knowing and willful representation that service was performed if the service was not performed.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The retirant has been retired for at least 9 consecutive months before becoming employed under this subsection. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Until 5 years after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this sentence, subsection (1) does not apply to a retirant who, at the time of the retirant's retirement, was employed in a position other than a superintendent and who is employed at a reporting unit if both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The retirant retired after a bona fide termination of employment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Either of the following applies:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The retirant has been retired for at least 6 consecutive months.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) For purposes of subsections (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7), the retirement system shall determine, in accordance with federal law that governs qualified retirement plans, whether a retirant retired after a bona fide termination of employment. If the retirement system determines that a retirant did not retire after a bona fide termination of employment, the retirement system may adjust the retirant retirement allowance effective date following a bona fide termination. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A reporting unit shall report the employment of a retirant as described in subsection (3) or (4), as applicable, to the retirement system in a manner determined by the retirement system.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For the purposes of computing payment under this section, the compensation amount used must not be less than the highest school fiscal year compensation previously earned by the member.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Until September 29, 2017 at 5 p.m. Eastern Daylight Saving Time, the retirement board shall grant service credit for the time a member is on a sabbatical leave authorized by a reporting unit, if the member returns to regular employment with the same reporting unit and acquires 1 year or more of subsequent service credit with that same reporting unit and if the member acquired 5 or more years of credited service with the reporting unit immediately before the sabbatical leave.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the sabbatical leave described in subsection (1) is granted before July 1, 1981, the reporting unit, if the reporting unit had a noncontributory plan at the time the sabbatical leave is granted, or the member, if the reporting unit has a contributory plan at the time the sabbatical leave is granted, shall pay to the system for each year of sabbatical leave credit an amount equal to 5% of the member's compensation earned in the school fiscal year immediately before the school fiscal year in which the sabbatical leave is granted, together with regular interest from the end of the school fiscal year in which the sabbatical leave was or is granted to the earlier of the following dates following the date of payment, the first day of the school fiscal year beginning after the date of payment or the first day of the seventh month of the school fiscal year in which the payment is made. If the reporting unit makes the payment required by this subsection, the reporting unit also shall pay the required interest. If the member makes the payment required by this subsection, the member also shall pay the required interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the sabbatical leave described in subsection (1) is granted after June 30, 1981, the member shall pay an amount equal to 5% of the member's full-time or equated full-time compensation earned in the school fiscal year immediately before the school fiscal year in which payment is made for each year of service credit the member elects to purchase. In computing payment under this subsection, the compensation amount used, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, must not be less than the highest school fiscal year compensation the member earned from the reporting unit that granted the sabbatical leave. If the compensation amount used for computing payment under this subsection exceeds the member's final average compensation determined at the time of retirement, the payment required under this subsection must be recomputed using the member's final average compensation and a refund must be made based on the recomputation. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If, before October 31, 1980, either the reporting unit or the member has contributed 5% of the member's compensation for the school fiscal year in which the sabbatical leave was granted in order to purchase service credit for that sabbatical leave, a further payment for the purchase of service credit for that sabbatical leave shall not be required. If a member has paid the amount required under subsection (2) for the purchase of service credit for sabbatical leave, but later receives a refund of that amount, the member, not the reporting unit, shall repay the amount with regular interest as required by subsection (2) if the member elects to purchase service credit for the sabbatical leave. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Effective October 1, 1981, the retirement board shall grant service credit for the time a member is on either an employee organization professional services leave or employee organization professional services released time authorized by a reporting unit if all of the following conditions are satisfied, as applicable: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For a member who is on either a professional services leave or professional services released time that first began before October 1, 1996, which leave or released time is renewed annually by the reporting unit, the member is included on the reporting unit's reports required by section 42(6) and compensation, service, contribution, and other requirements are reported on the same basis as for those members of the reporting unit who were not granted an employee organization professional services leave or employee organization professional services released time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For a member who is on either a professional services leave or professional services released time, which leave or released time does not meet the requirements of subdivision (a), the member is included on the reporting unit's reports in the manner required by subdivision (a), except that compensation is reported at the rate of compensation paid to the member by the reporting unit immediately preceding the date the member commenced the professional services leave or professional services released time along with the normal and customary compensation increases that would have been paid to the member by the reporting unit had the member remained in the same position held at the reporting unit immediately preceding the date the member commenced the leave or released time. However, if the member was not working a full 12-month period for the reporting unit immediately preceding the date the member commenced the professional services leave or professional services released time and is working a full 12-month period for the public school employee organization, the rate of compensation paid to the member by the reporting unit immediately preceding the date the member commenced the leave or released time may be increased proportionately to reflect the additional time worked for the public school employee organization. That adjusted compensation, along with the normal and customary compensation increases otherwise allowed in this subdivision, must then be reported as required in this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For a member who is on either a professional services leave or professional services released time that first began before October 1, 1996, which leave or released time is renewed annually by the reporting unit, the reporting unit remits the amount required by section 42 and the percentage of aggregate annual compensation provided from the state school aid fund for current service, if any, the percentage determined for unfunded accrued service as required by section 41, and the employer's share of social security contributions if the reporting unit is responsible for remitting the employee's share of social security contributions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) For a member who is on either a professional services leave or professional services released time, which professional services leave or professional services released time does not meet the requirements of subdivision (c), the reporting unit remits the amounts required by subdivision (c) based on the rate of compensation paid to the member by the reporting unit immediately preceding the date the member commenced the professional services leave or professional services released time along with the normal and customary compensation increases that would have been paid to the member by the reporting unit had the member remained in the same position held at the reporting unit immediately preceding the date the member commenced the leave or released time. However, if the member was not working a full 12-month period for the reporting unit immediately preceding the date the member commenced the professional services leave or professional services released time and is working a full 12-month period for the public school employee organization, the rate of compensation paid to the member by the reporting unit immediately preceding the date the member commenced the leave or released time may be increased proportionately to reflect the additional time worked for the public school employee organization. That adjusted compensation, along with the normal and customary compensation increases otherwise allowed in this subdivision, must then be reported as required in this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The reporting unit must be reimbursed those sums paid to the retirement board under subsection (5) by the member or the public school employee organization on a current basis. A member who has credited service as an employee of a school district of the first class, as described in part 6 of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.401 to 380.485, for a leave of absence effective before October 1, 1981, shall continue to receive credit based on the law of this state in effect at the time the leave of absence was initially effective.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The member files a written application with the retirement board within the incentivized retirement application period stating a retirement allowance effective date that is on or after July 1, 2010 but not later than September 1, 2010.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Upon his or her retirement as provided in this section, a member who retires with a retirement effective date on or before September 1, 2010 shall receive a retirement allowance equal to the member's number of years and fraction of a year of credited service multiplied by 1.6% of the member's final average compensation if the final average compensation is $90,000.00 or less and the member is eligible to retire under section 81 with a retirement allowance that is not subject to reduction under section 84(2). If the member is eligible to retire under section 81 with a retirement allowance that is not subject to reduction under section 84(2) and has a final average compensation that is greater than $90,000.00, the retirement allowance shall be equal to the member's number of years and fraction of a year of credited service multiplied by 1.6% of his or her final average compensation up to a final average compensation of $90,000.00 and the remaining portion of the retirement allowance shall be equal to the member's number of years and fraction of a year of credited service multiplied by 1.5% of the portion of final average compensation over $90,000.00. For members eligible under this section because the member's combined age and length of credited service is equal to or greater than 80 years, upon his or her retirement as provided in this section, a member who retires with a retirement effective date on or before September 1, 2010 shall receive a retirement allowance equal to the member's number of years and fraction of a year of credited service multiplied by 1.55% of the member's final average compensation if the final average compensation is $90,000.00 or less. For members eligible to retire under this section because the member's combined age and length of credited service is equal to or greater than 80 years whose final average compensation is greater than $90,000.00, the retirement allowance shall be calculated so that the member receives a portion of his or her retirement allowance equal to the member's number of years and fraction of a year of credited service multiplied by 1.55% of his or her final average compensation up to a final average compensation of $90,000.00 and the remaining portion of the retirement allowance shall be calculated as equal to the member's number of years and fraction of a year of credited service multiplied by 1.5% of the portion of final average compensation over $90,000.00.</div>

Each reporting unit having a member who elects to retire under this section may extend the retirement effective date of 1 member under this section. Up to an additional 2,500 extensions shall be allotted to reporting units using a pro-rata methodology determined by the retirement system. The retirement system shall notify reporting units of any additional extension allotments by May 22, 2010. To make an extension under this subsection, the superintendent or chief administrator shall submit to the retirement system notification of members whose retirement dates the superintendent or chief administrator will extend along with the written concurrence of the member on or before June 15, 2010. The superintendent or chief administrator shall not request, and the retirement system shall not implement, the extension of a member that exceeds the number of extensions allotted to his or her reporting unit.</div>

Any adjustment to the regular retirement age by the retirement board must take place within 12 months after the retirement board's adoption of the most recent experience investigation study on an effective date as determined by the retirement board.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to section 84b and except as provided in subsection (2), upon the member's retirement from service as provided in section 81, a member shall receive a retirement allowance that equals the product of the member's total years, and fraction of a year, of credited service multiplied by 1.5% of the member's final average compensation. A member shall not be allowed to use more than 15 years of out of system public education service, or more out of system public education service than service performed under this act or former 1945 PA 136 unless, before July 1, 1974, the member applied for out of system public education service credit based upon payment of contributions for the service as required under section 69, or former acts, in which case the total out of system public education service credited, not to exceed 15 years, shall be used to compute the member's retirement allowance if the minimum service requirements performed under this act or former acts or as a state employee under the state employees' retirement act, 1943 PA 240, MCL 38.1 to 38.69, are met.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The reduction of 1/2 of 1% for each month and fraction of a month from the member's retirement allowance effective date to the date of the member's sixtieth birthday provided for in former 1945 PA 136, applicable to a member who retired before July 1, 1974 and before attainment of age 60, shall not apply to a member who retired before that date, at age 55 or more, having 30 or more years of credited service. The retirement allowance shall be recalculated disregarding the reduction and the person receiving the retirement allowance shall be eligible to receive an adjusted retirement allowance based on the recalculation beginning January 1, 1986, but shall not be eligible to receive the adjusted amount attributable to any month beginning before January 1, 1986.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The reduction provided for in subsection (2) shall not apply to a member who retires under either section 86 or 87, or to a retirement allowance beneficiary who is granted an allowance under section 43c(c), 89, or 90.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The retirement allowance of a person who satisfies the requirements of this subsection shall be recalculated based on 1.5% of final average compensation times years of credited service. The person receiving the retirement allowance shall be eligible to receive an adjusted retirement allowance based on the recalculation beginning January 1, 1986, but shall not be eligible to receive the adjusted amount attributable to any month beginning before January 1, 1986. A retirement allowance shall be recalculated under this subsection if 1 of the following applies: </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A retiring member or retiring deferred member who meets the requirements of section 81 or 81a or a member whom the retirement board finds to be totally and permanently disabled and eligible to receive a retirement allowance under section 86 or 87 shall elect to receive his or her retirement allowance under 1 of the payment options provided in this subsection. The election shall be in writing and filed with the retirement board at least 15 days before the effective date of the retirement allowance except as provided for a disability retirant under section 86 or 87. The amount of retirement allowance under subdivision (b), (c), or (d) shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of retirement allowance under subdivision (a). The options are as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A retirant shall be paid a straight retirement allowance for life computed pursuant to section 84. An additional retirement allowance payment shall not be made upon the retirant's death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A retirant shall be paid a reduced retirement allowance for life with the provision that upon the retirant's death, payment of the reduced retirement allowance is continued throughout the lifetime of the retirement allowance beneficiary whom the member or deferred member designates in a writing filed with the retirement board at the time of election of this option. A member or deferred member may elect this option and designate a retirement allowance beneficiary under the conditions set forth in section 82(2) or 89(3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A retirant shall be paid a reduced retirement allowance for life with the provision that upon the retirant's death, payment of 1/2 of the reduced retirement allowance is continued throughout the lifetime of the retirement allowance beneficiary whom the member designated in a writing filed with the retirement board at the time of election of the option.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) On and after January 1, 2000, a retirant shall be paid a reduced retirement allowance for life with the provision that upon the retirant's death, payment of 75% of the reduced retirement allowance is continued throughout the lifetime of the retirement allowance beneficiary whom the member designated in a writing filed with the retirement board at the time of election of the option.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In addition to the election under subsection (1), a retirant, other than a disability retirant who is 60 years of age or less, may elect to coordinate his or her retirement allowance with an estimated primary social security benefit. The retirant shall be paid an increased retirement allowance until 62 years of age and a reduced retirement allowance after 62 years of age. The increased retirement allowance paid until 62 years of age shall approximate the sum of the reduced retirement allowance payable after 62 years of age and the retirant's estimated social security primary insurance amount. The estimated social security primary insurance amount shall be determined by the retirement system. The election under this subsection shall be made at the same time and in the same manner as required under subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the election of a payment option in subsections (1) and (2) shall not be changed on or after the effective date of the retirement allowance. Except as provided in this section, the retirement allowance beneficiary selected under subsection (1)(b), (c), or (d) shall not be changed on or after the effective date of the retirement allowance and shall be either a spouse, brother, sister, parent, or child, including an adopted child, of the member, deferred member, retiring member, or retiring deferred member entitled to make the election under this act. Another retirement allowance beneficiary shall not be selected. If a member, deferred member, retiring member, or retiring deferred member is married at the retirement allowance effective date, an election under subsection (1), other than an election under subsection (1)(b), (c), or (d) naming the spouse as retirement allowance beneficiary, shall not be effective unless the election is signed by the spouse, except that this requirement may be waived by the board if the signature of a spouse cannot be obtained because of extenuating circumstances. For purposes of this subsection, "spouse" means the person to whom the member, deferred member, retiring member, or retiring deferred member is married at the retirement allowance effective date. Payment to a retirement allowance beneficiary shall start the first day of the month following the retirant's death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (8), if the retirement allowance beneficiary selected under subsection (1)(b), (c), or (d) predeceases the retirant, the retirant's benefit shall revert to a straight retirement allowance including post-retirement adjustments, if any, shall be effective the first of the month following the death, and shall be paid during the remainder of the retirant's life. This subsection applies to a retirant whose effective date of retirement is after June 28, 1976, but the straight retirement allowance shall not be payable for any month beginning before the later of the retirement allowance beneficiary's death or October 31, 1980. This subsection also applies to a retirant whose effective date of retirement was on or before June 28, 1976, but the straight retirement allowance shall not be payable for any month beginning before the later of the retirement allowance beneficiary's death or January 1, 1986. A retirant who on January 1, 1986 is receiving a reduced retirement allowance because the retirant designated a retirement allowance beneficiary and the retirement allowance beneficiary predeceased the retirant is eligible to receive the straight retirement allowance beginning January 1, 1986, but the straight retirement allowance shall not be payable for any month beginning before January 1, 1986.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A retirant who returns to service pursuant to section 61 and whose retirement allowance beneficiary selected under subsection (1)(b), (c), or (d) predeceases the member before he or she again becomes a retirant may again choose a retirement allowance beneficiary pursuant to subsection (1)(b), (c), or (d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a retirant receiving a reduced retirement allowance under subsection (1)(b), (c), or (d) is divorced from the spouse who had been designated as the retirant's retirement allowance beneficiary under subsection (1)(b), (c), or (d), the election of a reduced retirement allowance payment option shall be considered void by the retirement system if the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, or an amended judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, described in the public employee retirement benefit protection act, 2002 PA 100, MCL 38.1681 to 38.1689, and dated after June 27, 1991 provides that the election of a reduced retirement allowance payment option under subsection (1)(b), (c), or (d) is to be considered void by the retirement system and the retirant provides a certified copy of the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, or an amended judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, to the retirement system. If the election of a reduced retirement allowance payment option under subsection (1)(b), (c), or (d) is considered void by the retirement system under this subsection, the retirant's retirement allowance shall revert to a straight retirement allowance, including postretirement adjustments, if any, subject to an award or order of the court as described in the public employee retirement benefit protection act, 2002 PA 100, MCL 38.1681 to 38.1689. The retirement allowance shall revert to a straight retirement allowance under this subsection effective the first of the month after the date the retirement system receives a certified copy of the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court. This subsection does not supersede a judgment of divorce or award or order of the court in effect on June 27, 1991. This subsection does not require the retirement system to distribute or pay retirement assets on behalf of a retirant in an amount that exceeds the actuarially determined amount that would otherwise become payable if a judgment of divorce had not been rendered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the retirement allowance payments terminate before an aggregate amount equal to the retirant's accumulated contributions has been paid, the difference between the retirant's accumulated contributions and the aggregate amount of retirement allowance payments made shall be paid to the person designated in a writing filed with the retirement board on a form provided by the retirement board. If the designated person does not survive the retirant or retirement allowance beneficiary, the difference shall be paid to the deceased recipient's estate or to the legal representative of the deceased recipient.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A retirant who selected a retirement allowance beneficiary under subsection (1)(b), (c), or (d) may change his or her retirement allowance beneficiary if all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The first retirement allowance beneficiary is a spouse.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The first retirement allowance beneficiary predeceases the retirant after the retirement allowance effective date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The retirant marries another spouse after the retirement allowance effective date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The retirant files a written request with the retirement system to name his or her current spouse as a retirement allowance beneficiary not earlier than 180 days and not later than 1 year after the marriage of the retirant and the current spouse except that a retirant whose first retirement allowance beneficiary predeceases the retirant after the retirement allowance effective date and before the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection shall have 180 days from the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection to file a written request with the retirement system.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 88.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The retirement board may require a duty or nonduty disability retirant to submit to a medical examination by a practicing physician or a medical officer designated by the retirement board as necessary for proof of eligibility for continuance of the disability allowance. The retirement board may require each disability retirant who is 59 years of age or less to submit a sworn affidavit during January of each year, in the form and manner prescribed by the retirement board, attesting that the retirant believes himself or herself to be totally and permanently disabled for the same reason for which the disability allowance was granted, and disclosing any significant change in physical or mental condition that occurred during the preceding 12-month period because of medical treatment. A retirant who submits information with intent to deceive may have the disability retirement allowance revoked by the retirement board.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The retirement board may discontinue a nonduty disability retirement allowance if medical examination reports indicate that the retirant no longer is disabled. If a nonduty disability retirant refuses to submit to an examination, the retirant's disability retirement allowance may be discontinued until withdrawal of the refusal. If a refusal continues for 12 months, the retirant's rights to a nonduty disability retirement allowance shall be revoked by the retirement board. However, upon the retirant's sixtieth birthday the retirant shall be paid a retirement allowance based on the final average compensation, service, and benefit formula as of the effective date of the retirant's nonduty disability retirement allowance if the retirant's contributions are left on deposit. If the nonduty disability retirant returns to membership service after termination of a disability allowance, the retirant shall again become a member of the retirement system. The retirant's credited service in effect at the time of disability retirement shall be restored.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If, upon examination of a duty disability retirant, the medical report indicates that the retirant no longer is disabled and is capable of resuming public school employment, the retirant shall be restored to active service with the reporting unit from which the person terminated employment and the duty disability retirement allowance shall cease. Payment of the duty disability retirement allowance shall continue until the retirant is actually returned to reporting unit service in a position for which the retirant is qualified by reason of training, or experience, or both. The retirant again shall become a member of the retirement system and the retirant's credited service in effect at the time of duty disability retirement shall be restored. If the retirant refuses to either submit to a medical examination or to return to reporting unit service and if either refusal continues for 12 months, the retirant's rights to a duty disability retirement shall cease. A lump sum payment shall be made of the difference between the retirant's accumulated contributions at time of retirement and the aggregate amount of the retirant's disability retirement allowance payments, unless the retirant has acquired 10 or more years of credited service before the time of his or her duty disability allowance. In that event, upon the retirant's sixtieth birthday, the retirant shall be paid a retirement allowance based upon the final average compensation, service, and benefit formula as of the effective date of the duty disability retirement allowance, if the retirant's contributions as a member are left on deposit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a disability retirant becomes engaged in gainful employment, and if the total of the retirant's income from the employment and retirement allowance exceeds the retirant's final average compensation, the retirement allowance shall be reduced to an amount which when added to the amount earned by the retirant equals the retirant's final average compensation. For purposes of computing allowable earnings under this subsection, the final average compensation shall be increased by 2% for each 12 months elapsed after the date the retirement allowance commenced. This subsection shall not apply on or after the date the duty or nonduty disability retirant otherwise would have been eligible for an age and service retirement allowance if the retirant had not become disabled, but the retirant shall be subject to section 61.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 89.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    If a member who continues as a public school employee on or after either the date the member has 15 years of credited service in effect, or the date of the member's sixtieth birthday if the member has 10 years of credited service in effect, dies before the effective date of his or her retirement and leaves a surviving spouse to whom the deceased member was married at time of death, the surviving spouse shall receive a retirement allowance computed in the same manner as if the deceased member had retired effective the day preceding the date of the deceased member's death, elected the option set forth in subsection (3), and nominated the surviving spouse as retirement allowance beneficiary. The surviving spouse's retirement allowance shall terminate upon the surviving spouse's death. A surviving spouse who on June 27, 1984, is receiving a retirement allowance under this section or the predecessor to this section under former Act No. 136 of the Public Acts of 1945 shall be eligible to continue receiving that retirement allowance regardless of the surviving spouse's remarriage. A surviving spouse whose retirement allowance under this section or the predecessor to this section under former Act No. 136 of the Public Acts of 1945 was terminated due to the surviving spouse's remarriage shall be eligible to receive that allowance beginning on the first day of the month following the month in which written application for reinstatement is filed with the board, but shall not be eligible to receive the allowance attributable to any month beginning before the month of reinstatement under this section. A surviving spouse of a person who was a deferred member on October 31, 1980, who becomes eligible to receive a retirement allowance under this section or the predecessor to this section under former Act No. 136 of the Public Acts of 1945, shall be eligible to receive that retirement allowance and that allowance shall not be subject to termination because of the surviving spouse's remarriage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the other requirements of subsection (1) are met but a surviving spouse does not exist, each of the deceased member's surviving children less than 18 years of age shall receive an allowance of an equal share of the retirement allowance which would have been paid to the spouse if living at the time of the deceased member's death. Payments under this subsection shall cease upon the surviving child's marriage, adoption, or becoming 18 years of age, whichever occurs first.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A member who continues as a public school employee on or after either the date the member has 15 years of credited service in effect, or the date of the member's sixtieth birthday if the member has 10 years of credited service in effect, may elect the option provided in section 85(1)(b) and nominate a retirement allowance beneficiary as provided in section 85(3). The election shall be in writing and filed with the retirement board in a manner and form prescribed by the retirement board. The election shall be void upon the member's retirement, termination of employment except as provided in section 82(2), divorce, the retirement allowance beneficiary's death, or upon the retirement allowance beneficiary no longer being dependent upon the member before the member's death. If a member who has an option election under section 85(1)(b) in effect dies before the effective date of his or her retirement, the member's retirement allowance beneficiary, so long as the beneficiary continues to be so dependent, shall receive the same retirement allowance as the retirement allowance beneficiary would have been entitled to receive under the option provided in section 85(1)(b) if the member had been regularly retired pursuant to section 81 or 82 the day preceding the date of the member's death, even though the member may not have acquired entitlement to service retirement. The surviving spouse of the deceased member shall be presumed to be 50% dependent on the deceased member for his or her own financial support. The surviving spouse's retirement allowance shall terminate upon the surviving spouse's death.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If at the time a retirement allowance beneficiary's retirement allowance granted by this section is terminated, the aggregate amount of retirement allowance payments received by the retirement allowance beneficiary are less than the accumulated contributions credited to the deceased member's account in the reserve for employee contributions at the time of the deceased member's death, the difference between the deceased member's accumulated contributions and the aggregate amount of retirement allowance payments received by the retirement allowance beneficiary shall be paid to the deceased member's refund beneficiary.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   For a member who contributes to the member investment plan, the credited service eligibility requirement applicable to the survivor benefits provided in this section are subject to section 43c.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    If a member dies as a result of injury or illness arising out of and in the course of the member's reporting unit service for which worker's disability compensation is paid, or a duty disability retirant who is in receipt of weekly worker's disability compensation on account of the retirant's reporting unit service dies from the same causes for which the person retired within 36 months after the retirant's retirement, and in either case the death or the illness or injury resulting in death is found by the retirement board to have resulted, without the member's or retirant's willful negligence, from the performance of the member's or retirant's reporting unit service, the surviving spouse of the deceased member or retirant shall receive a retirement allowance computed in the same manner as if the member or retirant had retired for reasons of age and service effective the day preceding the date of the member's or retirant's death, elected the option provided in section 85(1)(b), and nominated the surviving spouse as retirement allowance beneficiary. The surviving spouse's retirement allowance shall terminate upon death. A surviving spouse who on June 27, 1984, is receiving a retirement allowance under this section or the predecessor to this section under former Act No. 136 of the Public Acts of 1945 shall be eligible to continue receiving that retirement allowance regardless of the surviving spouse's remarriage. A surviving spouse whose retirement allowance under this section or the predecessor to this section under former Act No. 136 of the Public Acts of 1945 was terminated due to the surviving spouse's remarriage shall be eligible to receive that allowance beginning on the first day of the month following the month in which written application for reinstatement is filed with the board, but shall not be eligible to receive the allowance attributable to any month beginning before the month of reinstatement under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the other requirements of subsection (1) are met but a surviving spouse does not exist, each child of the deceased member or duty disability retirant who is less than 18 years of age shall receive an allowance of an equal share of the retirement allowance which would have been paid to the spouse if living at the time of the member's or retirant's death. Payments under this subsection shall cease upon marriage, adoption, or becoming 18 years of age, whichever occurs first. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the other requirements of subsection (1) are met and neither a surviving spouse nor an eligible child surviving the deceased member or duty disability retirant exists, a monthly allowance shall be paid to 1 surviving dependent parent whom the retirement board finds to be totally and permanently disabled and to have been dependent upon the deceased member or retirant for at least 50% of the parent's financial support. The allowance shall be computed in the same manner as if the deceased member or retirant had retired for reasons of age and service effective the day preceding the member's or retirant's death, elected the option provided in section 85(1)(b), and nominated the surviving parent as retirement allowance beneficiary. The surviving parent's beneficiary retirement allowance shall terminate upon marriage or death.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The retirement allowance beneficiary's duty death retirement allowance shall be computed pursuant to section 84, except that the reduction for early retirement shall not apply. The effective date of the retirement allowance beneficiary's duty death retirement allowance shall be the first of the month following the month in which the member or retirant died. The years of service credit used in computing the retirement allowance beneficiary's duty death retirement allowance shall not be less than 10 years. If the deceased member or duty disability retirant has less than 5 consecutive years of credited service, the average of the decedent's annual compensation shall be used. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Instead of the duty death benefits provided in this section to an eligible retirement allowance beneficiary, the retirement allowance beneficiary, before receipt of his or her first payment, may elect to accept a refund of the deceased member or duty disability retirant's accumulated contributions.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If, at the time a retirement allowance beneficiary's duty death retirement allowance granted by this section is terminated, the aggregate amount of retirement allowance payments received by the retirement allowance beneficiary is less than the accumulated contributions credited to the deceased member's or duty disability retirant's account in the reserve for employee contributions and the reserve for member investment plan at the time of the member's or retirant's death, the difference between the accumulated contributions and the aggregate amount of retirement allowance payments received by the retirement allowance beneficiary shall be paid to the legal representative of the deceased member's or retirant's estate.</DIV>

A member who first becomes a member on or after July 1, 2008 shall not be eligible for health benefits under this subsection until at least the time of application under subsection (8).

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An individual who first became a member or qualified participant on or after September 4, 2012 or who made the election under subsection (5) shall not receive any health insurance coverage premium from the retirement system for any benefits under section 91 or as a result of benefits provided under section 86, 87, or 89. In lieu of any of these benefits that might have been paid by the retirement system, a member's or qualified participant's employer shall make a matching contribution up to 2% of the member's or qualified participant's compensation to Tier 2 for each member who first became a member or qualified participant on or after September 4, 2012 or who made the election under subsection (5). A matching contribution under this subsection shall not be used as the basis for a loan from an employee's Tier 2 account. If the department or retirement system offers a health expenditure account or similar account for the purpose of managing a member's health care funds under this section, as permitted by state or federal law, the department or retirement system shall issue a request for proposals before implementation of that health expenditure account or similar account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An individual who first became a member or qualified participant on or after September 4, 2012 or who made the election under subsection (5) may make a contribution up to 2% of the member's or qualified participant's compensation to a Tier 2 account. A member or qualified participant described in this subsection may make additional contributions to his or her Tier 2 account as permitted by the department and the internal revenue code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a member or qualified participant is vested in contributions made to his or her Tier 2 account under subsections (1) and (2) according to the vesting provisions under section 132. A member who is eligible for the payment of health insurance coverage premiums by the retirement system as a result of benefits provided under section 90 is not vested in any employer contributions under subsection (1) and forfeits the employer contributions and earnings on those contributions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The contributions described in this section shall begin with the first payroll date after the member or qualified participant is employed or on or after the transition date for a member who makes the election under subsection (5) and end upon his or her termination of employment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as otherwise provided in this section, beginning September 4, 2012 and ending at 5 p.m. eastern standard time on January 9, 2013, the retirement system shall permit each qualified member to make an election to opt out of health insurance coverage premiums that would have been paid by the retirement system under section 91 and opt into the Tier 2 account provisions of this section effective on the transition date. A qualified member who makes the election under this subsection shall cease accruing years of service credit for purposes of calculating a portion of the health insurance coverage premiums that would have been paid by the retirement system under section 91 as if that section continued to apply.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A qualified member who does not make the election under subsection (5) continues to be eligible for the payment of health insurance coverage premiums by the retirement system under section 91 and is not eligible for the Tier 2 account provisions of this section. An individual who is not a qualified member, who is a former member on September 3, 2012, and who is reemployed by an employer on or after September 4, 2012 shall be treated in the same manner as a member described in this subsection who did not make the election under subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The retirement system shall calculate an amount to be credited to a Tier 2 account for each member who makes the election under subsection (5). The amount described in this subsection shall be an amount equal to the contributions made by the member under section 43e. A member who makes the election under subsection (5) shall cease making contributions under section 43e as determined by the retirement system, but no later than the first payroll date after the transition date. The amount calculated under this subsection shall be deposited as an employer contribution into the member's Tier 2 account as determined by the retirement system, but no later than the first payroll date after March 1, 2013. A member is immediately 100% vested in amounts deposited to his or her Tier 2 account under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A member or former member who does not make the election under subsection (5), who is 60 years of age or older, who does not qualify for the payment of health insurance coverage premiums by the retirement system under section 91, and who files an application with the retirement system on or after termination of employment shall receive a separate retirement allowance as calculated under this subsection. Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, the separate retirement allowance under this subsection shall be paid for 60 months and shall be equal to 1/60 of the amount equal to the contributions made by the member under section 43e. The retirement system may pay out de minimus amounts as a lump sum as determined by the retirement system and as permitted by the internal revenue code. A member receiving a separate retirement allowance under this subsection shall not subsequently receive the payment of health insurance coverage premiums by the retirement system under section 91. A member who dies before qualifying for the payment of health insurance coverage premiums by the retirement system under section 91 shall have a separate retirement allowance as provided in this subsection paid to the member's beneficiary upon application to the retirement system. A member who qualifies for the payment of health insurance coverage premiums by the retirement system under section 91 but who dies before the payment of health insurance coverage premiums by the retirement system in an amount equal to or greater than the amounts contributed under section 43e shall have a separate retirement allowance as provided in this subsection paid to the member's beneficiary following the cessation of health insurance coverage premiums paid by the retirement system in an amount equal to the difference between the health insurance coverage premiums paid by the retirement system under section 91 and contributions made by the member under section 43e. The amount of the separate retirement allowance as determined under this subsection shall be increased in a manner as determined by the retirement system by a percentage equal to 1.5% multiplied by the total number of years that member made contributions under section 43e.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A member or former member who has a break in service and is reemployed retains the same election that the member made under this section before the break in service. If the member made the election under subsection (5), the member shall continue to receive the Tier 2 account contributions as provided in subsections (1) and (2). If the member did not make the election under subsection (5), the member shall continue to make the contributions as provided under section 43e and is subject to subsection (8), if applicable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) In lieu of any other health insurance coverage premium that might have been paid by the retirement system under section 91, a credit to a health reimbursement account within the trust created under the public employee retirement health care funding act, 2010 PA 77, MCL 38.2731 to 38.2747, shall be made by the retirement system in the amounts and to the members or qualified participants as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Two thousand dollars to an individual who first became a member or qualified participant on or after September 4, 2012, who is 60 years of age or older, and who has at least 10 years of service at his or her first termination of employment.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The retirement system shall determine a method to implement subsections (5) to (10), including a method for crediting the amounts in those subsections to comply with any restrictions imposed by the internal revenue code. Notwithstanding any provision of this act to the contrary, the Tier 2 plan provisions of this section shall be implemented by the department as soon as feasible but not later than January 1, 2013.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Subsections (5) to (10) do not apply to a member who is eligible for the payment of health insurance coverage premiums by the retirement system as a result of benefits provided under section 90.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) On or before July 1, 2017, the retirement system shall provide a report to the chairs of the house and senate appropriations committees that provides the projected impact of subsection (10) as it applies to members first employed and entered upon the payroll of reporting units on or after July 1, 2017 with regard to the annual required contribution as used by the governmental accounting standards board and for purposes of the annual financial statements prepared under section 28(1).</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>38.1408 Administration of retirement system as qualified pension plan created in trust under internal revenue code; requirements and benefit limitations; qualified military service.</B><P>Sec. 108.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) This section is enacted pursuant to federal law that imposes certain administrative requirements and benefit limitations for qualified governmental plans. This state intends that the retirement system be a qualified pension plan created in trust under section 401 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, and that the trust be an exempt organization under section 501 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 501. The department shall administer the retirement system to fulfill this intent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The retirement system shall be administered in compliance with the provisions of section 415 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, and regulations under that section that are applicable to governmental plans and beginning January 1, 2010, applicable provisions of the final regulations issued by the internal revenue service on April 5, 2007. Employer-financed benefits provided by the retirement system under this act shall not exceed the applicable limitations set forth in section 415 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, as adjusted by the commissioner of internal revenue under section 415(d) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, to reflect cost-of-living increases, and the retirement system shall adjust the benefits, including benefits payable to retirants and retirement allowance beneficiaries, subject to the limitation each calendar year to conform with the adjusted limitation. For purposes of section 415(b) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, the applicable limitation shall apply to aggregated benefits received from all qualified pension plans for which the office of retirement services coordinates administration of that limitation. If there is a conflict between this section and another section of this act, this section prevails.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The assets of the retirement system shall be held in trust and invested for the sole purpose of meeting the legitimate obligations of the retirement system and shall not be used for any other purpose. The assets shall not be used for or diverted to a purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members, deferred members, retirants, and retirement allowance beneficiaries.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The retirement system shall return post-tax member contributions made by a member and received by the retirement system to a member on retirement, pursuant to internal revenue service regulations and approved internal revenue service exclusion ratio tables.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The required beginning date for retirement allowances and other distributions shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee attains age 70-1/2 or April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee retires. The required minimum distribution requirements imposed by section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, shall apply to this act and be administered in accordance with a reasonable and good faith interpretation of the required minimum distribution requirements for all years to which the required minimum distribution requirements apply to the act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the retirement system is terminated, the interest of the members, deferred members, retirants, and retirement allowance beneficiaries in the retirement system is nonforfeitable to the extent funded as described in section 411(d)(3) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 411, and the related internal revenue service regulations applicable to governmental plans.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act to the contrary that would limit a distributee's election under this act, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the retirement board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Beginning October 1, 2010, a nonspouse beneficiary may elect to have any portion of an amount payable under this act that is an eligible rollover distribution treated as a direct rollover that will be paid in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 408, that is established for the purpose of receiving a distribution on behalf of the beneficiary and that will be treated as an inherited individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity pursuant to section 402(c)(11) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 402.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) For purposes of determining actuarial equivalent retirement allowances under sections 45 and 85(1)(b), (1)(c), (1)(d), and (2), the actuarially assumed interest rate shall be determined by the director of the department and the retirement board in consultation with the actuary with utilization of the mortality tables adopted by the department and the retirement board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the compensation of a member of the retirement system shall be taken into account for any year under the retirement system only to the extent that it does not exceed the compensation limit established in section 401(a)(17) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, as adjusted by the commissioner of internal revenue. This subsection applies to any person who first becomes a member of the retirement system on or after October 1, 1996.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, contributions, benefits, and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided under the retirement system in accordance with section 414(u) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 414. This subsection applies to all qualified military service on or after December 12, 1994. Effective January 1, 2007, in accordance with section 401(a)(37) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, if a member dies while performing qualified military service, for purposes of determining any death benefits payable under this act, the member shall be treated as having resumed and then terminated employment on account of death.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to subsections (5) to (7), the annual level percentage of payroll contribution rate must be actuarially determined using experience assumptions and level percent of payroll actuarial cost methods adopted by the retirement board and the department pursuant to an annual actuarial valuation, which must be sufficient to finance benefits being provided and to be provided by the retirement system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Subject to subsections (5) to (7), for differences occurring in fiscal years beginning on or after October 1, 2001, a minimum of 20% of the difference between the estimated and the actual aggregate compensation and the estimated and the actual contribution rate described in subsection (2), if any, may be submitted in the executive budget to the legislature for appropriation in the next succeeding state fiscal year and a minimum of 25% of the remaining difference must be submitted in the executive budget to the legislature for appropriation in each of the following 4 state fiscal years, or until 100% of the remaining difference is submitted, whichever first occurs. In addition, interest must be included for each year that a portion of the remaining difference is carried forward. The interest rate must equal the actuarially assumed rate of investment return for the state fiscal year in which payment is made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) For each fiscal year that begins on or after October 1, 2003, if the actuarial valuation prepared under this section for each fiscal year demonstrates that as of the beginning of a fiscal year, and after all credits and transfers required by this act for the previous fiscal year have been made, the sum of the actuarial value of assets and the actuarial present value of future normal cost contributions exceeds the actuarial present value of benefits, the amount based on the annual level percent of payroll contribution rate under subsections (1) and (2) may be deposited into the health advance funding subaccount created by section 42.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Beginning with the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2022 until the pension and retiree health care payroll growth assumption rate is zero, the payroll growth assumption rate must be reduced by 50 basis points. Beginning with the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, the office of retirement services within the department of technology, management, and budget and the retirement board may agree to reduce the rate described in this subsection by any number of additional basis points.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Beginning with the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 and for each subsequent fiscal year, the normal cost contribution rate must not be less than the normal cost contribution rate in the immediately preceding fiscal year. Additionally, the employer portion of the contribution rate must not be less than the employer portion of the contribution rate in the immediately preceding fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Subject to this subsection, beginning with the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 and for each subsequent fiscal year until the unfunded actuarial accrued liability is paid off, the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution sum and due payable must not be less than the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution sum and due payable in the immediately preceding fiscal year. The unfunded actuarial accrued liability must be paid off no later than September 30, 2038. Additionally, the employer portion of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution sum and due payable must not be less than the employer portion of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution sum and due payable in the immediately preceding fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, if the retirement board establishes an arrangement and fund as described in section 6 of the public employee retirement benefit protection act, 2002 PA 100, MCL 38.1686, the benefits that are required to be paid from that fund must be paid from a portion of the employer contributions described in this section or other eligible funds. The retirement board shall determine the amount of the employer contributions or other eligible funds that must be allocated to that fund and deposit that amount in that fund before it deposits any remaining employer contributions or other eligible funds in the pension fund.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) This section is enacted under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, that imposes certain administrative requirements and benefit limitations for qualified governmental plans. This state intends that the retirement system be a qualified pension plan created in trust under section 401 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, and that the trust be an exempt organization under section 501 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 501. The department shall administer the retirement system to fulfill this intent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The retirement system must be administered in compliance with section 415 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, and regulations under that section that are applicable to governmental plans and, beginning January 1, 2010, applicable provisions of the final regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service on April 5, 2007. Employer-financed benefits provided by the retirement system under this act must not exceed the applicable limitations set forth in section 415 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, as adjusted by the commissioner of internal revenue under section 415(d) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, to reflect cost of living increases, and the retirement system must adjust the benefits, including benefits payable to retirants and retirement allowance beneficiaries, subject to the limitation each calendar year to conform with the adjusted limitation. For purposes of section 415(b) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, the applicable limitation applies to aggregated benefits received from all qualified pension plans for which the office of retirement services coordinates administration of that limitation. If there is a conflict between this section and another section of this act, this section prevails.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The assets of the retirement system must be held in trust and invested for the sole purpose of meeting the legitimate obligations of the retirement system and must not be used for any other purpose. The assets must not be used for or diverted to a purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members, deferred members, retirants, and beneficiaries before satisfaction of all retirement system liabilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The retirement system shall return post-tax member contributions made by a member and received by the retirement system to a member upon retirement, pursuant to Internal Revenue Service regulations and approved Internal Revenue Service exclusion ratio tables.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The required beginning date for retirement allowances and other distributions must not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee attains age 70-1/2 or April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee retires. The required minimum distribution requirements imposed by section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, apply to this act and must be administered in accordance with a reasonable and good faith interpretation of the required minimum distribution requirements for all years to which the required minimum distribution requirements apply to this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the retirement system is terminated, the interest of the members, deferred members, retirants, and beneficiaries in the retirement system is nonforfeitable to the extent funded as described in section 411(d)(3) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 411, and related internal revenue service regulations applicable to governmental plans.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act to the contrary that would limit a distributee's election under this act, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the retirement board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Beginning October 1, 2010, a nonspouse beneficiary may elect to have any portion of an amount payable under this act that is an eligible rollover distribution treated as a direct rollover that will be paid in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 408, that is established for the purpose of receiving a distribution on behalf of the beneficiary and that will be treated as an inherited individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity pursuant to section 402(c)(11) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 402.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the compensation of a member of the retirement system must be taken into account for any year under the retirement system only to the extent that it does not exceed the compensation limit established in section 401(a)(17) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, as adjusted by the commissioner of internal revenue. This subsection applies to any person who first becomes a member of the retirement system on or after October 1, 1996.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, contributions, benefits, and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided under the retirement system in accordance with section 414(u) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 414. This subsection applies to all qualified military service on or after December 12, 1994. Effective January 1, 2007, in accordance with section 401(a)(37) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, if a member dies while performing qualified military service for purposes of determining any death benefits payable under this act, the member is treated as having resumed and then terminated employment on account of death.</div>

However, a member described in this subsection who becomes 56 years of age shall retire. A member retiring under this subsection is entitled to receive a retirement allowance equal to 60% of his or her final average compensation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to subsection (4), if a retirant receiving a retirement allowance under subsection (1) dies, the retirement allowance must continue to be paid to the surviving spouse of the retirant for the rest of the spouse's life. If there is not a surviving spouse or on the spouse's death, the retirement allowance must be paid to the children under the age of 18 of the retirant, share and share alike. If the surviving spouse dies and there are not eligible children, the retirement system shall pay to the retirant's estate or his or her legal representative any residual accumulated contributions and interest made by the retirant into the fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the director of the department of state police orders the retirement of any member eligible to retire for reason or reasons other than having become 56 years of age, and that member is aggrieved by the order, the member affected by an order described in this subsection is entitled to appeal to the retirement board. An appeal must be in writing and filed with the retirement board within 30 days after receipt of the order of retirement. The retirement board shall set the appeal for hearing within 30 days after the filing of the appeal and shall review the facts as presented and determine whether the order of retirement will continue or be revoked. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A member who first becomes a member on or after July 1, 2006 as a new bargaining unit employee shall elect to receive his or her retirement allowance under 1 of the payment options provided in this subsection. The election must be in writing and filed with the retirement board at least 15 days before the effective date of the retirement allowance except as provided for a disability retirant under sections 26, 27, and 28. The amount of retirement allowance under subdivision (b), (c), or (d) is the actuarial equivalent of the amount of retirement allowance under subdivision (a). The options are as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The retirant will be paid a straight retirement allowance for life computed under section 24. An additional retirement allowance payment will not be made on the retirant's death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The retirant will be paid a reduced retirement allowance for life with a provision that on the retirant's death, payment of the reduced retirement allowance will be continued throughout the lifetime of the retirement allowance beneficiary whom the member or deferred member designated in a writing filed with the retirement board at the time of election of this option. A member or deferred member may elect this option and designate a retirement allowance beneficiary under the conditions set forth in subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A retirant must be paid a reduced retirement allowance for life with the provision that on the retirant's death, payment of 1/2 of the reduced retirement allowance is continued throughout the lifetime of the retirement allowance beneficiary whom the member designated in a writing filed with the retirement board at the time of election of the option.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A retirant must be paid a reduced retirement allowance for life with the provision that on the retirant's death, payment of 75% of the reduced retirement allowance is continued throughout the lifetime of the retirement allowance beneficiary whom the member designated in a writing filed with the retirement board at the time of election of the option.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the retirement allowance beneficiary selected under subsection (4)(b), (c), or (d) must not be changed on or after the effective date of the retirement allowance and must be either a spouse, brother, sister, parent, or child, including an adopted child, of the member, deferred member, retiring member, or retiring deferred member entitled to make the election under this act. Another retirement allowance beneficiary must not be selected. If a member, deferred member, retiring member, or retiring deferred member is married at the retirement allowance effective date, an election under subsection (4), other than an election under subsection (4)(b), naming the spouse as retirement allowance beneficiary, is not effective unless the election is signed by the spouse, except that this requirement may be waived by the board if the signature of a spouse cannot be obtained because of extenuating circumstances. For purposes of this subsection, "spouse" means the individual to whom the member, deferred member, retiring member, or retiring deferred member is married at the retirement allowance effective date. Payment to a retirement allowance beneficiary must start the first day of the month following the retirant's death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (9), if the retirement allowance beneficiary selected under subsection (4)(b), (c), or (d) predeceases the retirant, the retirant's benefit must revert to a straight retirement allowance including postretirement adjustments, if any; is effective the first of the month following the death; and must be paid during the remainder of the retirant's life. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a retirant receiving a reduced retirement allowance under subsection (4)(b), (c), or (d) is divorced from the spouse who had been designated as the retirant's retirement allowance beneficiary under subsection (4)(b), (c), or (d), the election of a reduced retirement allowance payment option is considered void by the retirement system if the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, or an amended judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, described in the public employee retirement benefit protection act, 2002 PA 100, MCL 38.1681 to 38.1689, and dated after June 27, 1991 provides that the election of a reduced retirement allowance payment option under subsection (4)(b), (c), or (d) is to be considered void by the retirement system and the retirant provides a certified copy of the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, or an amended judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, to the retirement system. If the election of a reduced retirement allowance payment option under subsection (4)(b), (c), or (d) is considered void by the retirement system under this subsection, the retirant's retirement allowance must revert to a straight retirement allowance, including postretirement adjustments, if any, subject to an award or order of the court as described in the public employee retirement benefit protection act, 2002 PA 100, MCL 38.1681 to 38.1689. The retirement allowance must revert to a straight retirement allowance under this subsection effective the first of the month after the date the retirement system receives a certified copy of the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court. This subsection does not supersede a judgment of divorce or award or order of the court in effect on June 27, 1991. This subsection does not require the retirement system to distribute or pay retirement assets on behalf of a retirant in an amount that exceeds the actuarially determined amount that would otherwise become payable if a judgment of divorce had not been rendered. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A retirant, who is divorced after payment of his or her retirement allowance begins and whose former spouse is his or her retirement allowance beneficiary, may change his or her survivor option to the straight life option only if an order of the court states that the election of a survivor option under subsection (4) is considered void by the retirement system.

</P>
<P>Sec. 24a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A deferred retirement option plan is established within the defined benefit plan that is part of the retirement system, and it is to be administered by the office of retirement services. Exclusively represented members of the retirement system may only participate in the deferred retirement option plan pursuant to notice from their collective bargaining agent that the agent agrees to the terms of the deferred retirement option plan. For each fiscal year that begins on or after October 1, 2004, the director of state police and the retirement board may elect to discontinue accepting applications for the deferred retirement option plan.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An officer who has 25 years or more of credited service under this act or former act 1935 PA 251, or both, may elect to participate in the deferred retirement option plan by executing the application provided by the office of retirement services. Once the application is accepted by the office of retirement services, the officer's participation in the deferred retirement option plan is irrevocable and he or she becomes a DROP participant. The officer is solely responsible for any federal, state, or local tax due as a result of his or her participation in the deferred retirement option plan.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Participation in the deferred retirement option plan does not guarantee continued employment. Except as otherwise provided in this section, an officer who elects to participate in the deferred retirement option plan will remain an active employee eligible to receive any applicable wage changes and benefits, will be subject to civil service rules and regulations, and will be subject to the policies and procedures of the department of state police and subject to removal by the governor, if applicable, in the same manner as if he or she had not elected to participate in the deferred retirement option plan.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   An officer shall indicate on the application for the deferred retirement option plan the number of years that the officer wants to participate in the deferred retirement option plan, up to a maximum of 6 years. As a condition for participation, the officer agrees to retire at the conclusion of his or her participation in the deferred retirement option plan.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A deferred retirement option plan account shall be created in the accounting records of the retirement system for each DROP participant. Each deferred retirement option plan account shall earn interest at the rate of 3% per annum, prorated for any fraction of a year. The deferred retirement option plan account of a DROP participant shall be credited with the following percentage of his or her monthly retirement allowance as calculated pursuant to section 24 as if he or she had retired on the day prior to becoming a DROP participant:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   100% if the officer remains in the deferred retirement option plan for 6 years.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   90% if the officer remains in the deferred retirement option plan for 5 years but less than 6 years.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   80% if the officer remains in the deferred retirement option plan for 4 years but less than 5 years.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   70% if the officer remains in the deferred retirement option plan for 3 years but less than 4 years.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   60% if the officer remains in the deferred retirement option plan for 2 years but less than 3 years.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   50% if the officer remains in the deferred retirement option plan for 1 year but less than 2 years.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   30% if the officer remains in the deferred retirement option plan for less than 1 year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A DROP participant shall not receive a monthly retirement allowance, as calculated pursuant to section 24, until termination of his or her deferred retirement option plan participation and commencement of retirement. A DROP participant shall not have any claim to any funds in his or her deferred retirement option plan account until he or she retires at the termination of his or her deferred retirement option plan participation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Upon termination of the deferred retirement option plan participation and commencement of retirement, the former DROP participant shall select 1 or more of the following options with regard to his or her deferred retirement option plan account:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A total lump-sum distribution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A partial lump-sum distribution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A lump-sum direct rollover to another qualified plan if allowed by federal law and subject to the procedures of the retirement system.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Maintain the funds in the account.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A former DROP participant shall remove all funds from his or her deferred retirement option plan account no later than April 1 following the later of the calendar year in which the DROP participant attains 70 years, 6 months of age or the calendar year in which the DROP participant is retired.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If a DROP participant or former DROP participant dies before removing all funds from his or her deferred retirement option plan account, the former DROP participant's designated beneficiary shall receive any remaining balances. If the former DROP participant has not named a beneficiary for his or her deferred retirement option plan account, the amount in the deferred retirement option plan account shall be paid to the beneficiary of the former DROP participant's retirement allowance. If the former DROP participant has not named a beneficiary to his or her retirement allowance, the balance in the former DROP participant's account shall be paid to the former DROP participant's estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   If a DROP participant is found to be disabled under section 29, his or her participation in the deferred retirement option plan shall immediately cease and he or she shall be retired.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   The deferred retirement option plan shall be administered in compliance with section 415 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, and regulations under that section that are applicable to a governmental deferred retirement option plan. If there is a conflict between this subsection and another subsection of this section, this subsection prevails.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   A deferred retirement option plan shall not be implemented until the civil service commission adopts rules to regulate all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A DROP participant's payment for sick leave, annual leave, longevity, and related items.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A DROP participant's accrual of sick leave, annual leave, compensatory time, and related items.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A DROP participant's payment of group insurance plan premiums.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   If the department receives notification from the United States internal revenue service that this section or any portion of this section will cause the retirement system to be disqualified for tax purposes under the internal revenue code, 26 USC 1 to 1789, then the portion that will cause the disqualification does not apply.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in section 24(4) and subject to subsection (4), the retirement system shall pay a retirement allowance to the surviving spouse of a member who, while in the discharge of his or her duty, is killed or receives injuries or contracts a disease or illness, by reason of his or her occupation, that results in his or her death. The retirement allowance must be equal to 60% of the member's final average compensation. On the death of the surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse at the time of the death of the member, the retirement allowance must be paid to the children of the member under the age of 18 years, share and share alike. When each respective child attains the age of 18 years, payment to him or her must cease and his or her share must be prorated among the remaining children under 18 years of age. If there is a retirement allowance payable to a surviving spouse under this section, a retirement allowance of $100.00 per month must be paid to each of the children under the age of 18 years, if any, of the deceased member, and all payments to the children must continue until each respective child reaches the age of 18 years. If there is not a surviving spouse, nor children under the age of 18 years, a retirement allowance equal to 60% of the member's final average compensation must be paid to the mother or father, or both, of the member, if dependent on him or her for support, until the dependency ceases. If there is not a dependent mother or father, a retirement allowance of $100.00 per month must be paid to each of the sisters or brothers, if there are any under 18 years of age dependent upon the member for support. If there are not any dependents, there must be paid to the deceased member's estate any residual accumulated contributions and interest made by him or her into the reserve for employee contributions, or $1,500.00, whichever is greater.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The supplements to retirement allowances and minimum annual retirement allowance provisions of this act do not apply to the special $100.00 per month allowance to children and the allowance to dependent parents and siblings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The retirement allowance payable under this section, when added to the statutory worker's compensation benefits applicable in the case, must not exceed the average annual salary paid to the member for the member's last 2 years of service with the department of state police before his or her death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) For a member who first becomes a member on or after June 10, 2012, who while in the discharge of his or her duty is killed or receives injuries or contracts a disease or illness, by reason of his or her occupation, that results in his or her death, a retirement allowance must be paid in the same manner as provided for a duty disabled retirant under section 26. The retirement allowance payable under this section to a duly designated survivor beneficiary of a member who first becomes a member on or after June 10, 2012 must be offset by the actuarially determined value of the employer-funded portion plus the associated investment growth of the employer-funded portion of the member's defined contribution account balance. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A member, former member, or beneficiary of a deceased member, which member first becomes a member on or after June 10, 2012 and who is eligible for a retirement allowance under this section, is eligible for health insurance coverage under section 42 in all respects and under the same terms as would be a member who first becomes a member before June 10, 2012.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A member of the retirement system who has accumulated 10 or more years of retirement system service credit under this act or former 1935 PA 251, or both, and who, while an employee of the department of state police, was or is drafted, enlisted, inducted, or commissioned into active duty with the military, naval, marine, or other armed service of the United States government and who is accepted for reemployment as an employee of the department of state police who subscribes to the constitutional oath of office within 6 months following discharge from active service, or if hospitalized at date of discharge, is accepted for reemployment as an employee of the department who subscribes to the constitutional oath of office within 6 months following release from the military facility, has not more than 2 years of the active service credited as a member of the retirement system, in the same manner as if the member had served uninterruptedly. During the period of active service, and until reemployment, the member's contributions to the reserve for employee contributions must be suspended and the member's balance in his or her account standing to the member's credit as of the last payroll date preceding the member's leave of absence must be accumulated at regular interest. If the member withdraws all or part of the accumulated contributions from his or her account, the active service must not be credited until the member returns to the reserve for employee contributions those amounts withdrawn, together with regular interest computed from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A member of this retirement system who does not meet the requirements of subsection (1) and who was drafted, enlisted, inducted, or commissioned into active duty with the military or other armed service of the United States government may elect to receive service credit for not more than 2 years of active duty upon request and payment to the retirement system of an amount equal to 5% of the member's full-time compensation for the fiscal year in which the payment is made multiplied by the years and months the member elects to purchase up to the maximum. For the purposes of computing payment under this subsection, the compensation amount used must not be less than the highest fiscal year compensation previously received by the member. Service must not be credited if the service is or would be credited under any other federal, state, or local publicly supported retirement system, but this restriction does not apply to those persons who have or will have acquired retirement eligibility under the federal government for service in the reserve. Armed service must not be credited under this subsection until the member has accumulated 10 years of credited service, of which the last 5 are continuous.</div>

If the retirement system determines that the domestic relations order is not an EDRO under this act, the retirement system shall promptly notify the participant and alternate payee named in the domestic relations order that the domestic relations order is not an EDRO. The retirement system shall specify in the notice why the retirement system determined that the domestic relations order is not an EDRO under this act. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a determination by the retirement system that a domestic relations order is not an EDRO under this act does not prohibit a participant, alternate payee, or court from filing an amended domestic relations order with the retirement system under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Upon the retirement system's receipt of the domestic relations order, the participant's retirement allowance effective date shall be stayed and shall not occur until either of the following occur:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The retirement system accepts the domestic relations order for filing as an EDRO. In this instance, the participant's retirement allowance effective date will occur as if the participant's retirement allowance effective date had not been stayed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Sixty days have passed starting on the date the retirement system gives the participant and alternate payee notice that the retirement system will not accept the domestic relations order for filing as an EDRO because of a defect in the domestic relations order that disqualifies it as an EDRO, unless otherwise provided in this subsection. During this 60-day period, the parties may submit to the retirement system an amended domestic relations order that will qualify for filing as an EDRO. The retirement system shall provide notice of rejection of any amended domestic relations orders in the same manner set forth above, but there can only be one 60-day period and only with respect to rejection of the first domestic relations order submitted to the retirement system for filing as an EDRO. If the 60-day period is applicable and the parties submit in a timely manner a domestic relations order that is acceptable as an EDRO, but the retirement system does not make this determination until after expiration of the 60-day period, the participant's retirement allowance effective date will be further stayed until the retirement system makes this determination. If the 60-day period is applicable and the participant dies or the parties fail to submit to the retirement system a domestic relations order that qualifies as an EDRO before expiration of the 60-day period, the retirement system shall not accept for filing as an EDRO any domestic relations orders pertaining to the participant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If, upon receipt of a retirement application from a participant, the retirement system determines that a previously submitted domestic relations order that is intended to qualify as an EDRO does not qualify as an EDRO, the retirement system shall notify the participant and alternate payee stating the reasons why the domestic relations order does not qualify as an EDRO, if the retirement system has not already provided that notice. In cases where notice is required to be given under this section, the participant's retirement allowance effective date is stayed as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If an EDRO is filed with the retirement system, but the participant and alternate payee wish to file an amended EDRO, they may do so at any time before the participant's retirement allowance effective date, or death, whichever occurs first. In this instance, the participant's retirement allowance effective date will not be stayed upon the submission of the domestic relations order. If the participant and alternate payee fail to submit a domestic relations order that qualifies as an EDRO before the participant's retirement allowance effective date or before the participant's death, whichever occurs first, the latest EDRO filed with the retirement system governs. The EDRO cannot be amended, vacated, or otherwise set aside after the retirement system has made the first payment under the EDRO or after the participant dies, whichever occurs first.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The retirement system shall provide all notice it is required to give to the participant or alternate payee under this act by first-class mail addressed to the participant and alternate payee at the address listed for each in the domestic relations order submitted to the retirement system for filing as an EDRO. If no address is listed for the participant in the domestic relations order, the retirement system shall mail the notice to the last known address of the participant that the retirement system has in its files. If no address is listed for the alternate payee in the domestic relations order, notice to the participant is notice to the alternate payee. Notice is given if the retirement system complies with this section and upon the date the notice is mailed.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 214a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Following the date of the determination described in subsection (11) and following the date of the election made under subsection (4), the retirement system shall provide postretirement medical benefits for eligible judges and their health benefit dependents and postdeath medical benefits for health benefit dependents who survive a deceased contributor. Medical benefits shall be provided from a separate account established under the retirement system pursuant to section 401(h) of the United States internal revenue code.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A separate account, designated as the "medical benefit account", shall be maintained within the reserve for health benefits. The assets of the retirement system in excess of the amounts then credited to the medical benefit account shall not be used for providing medical benefits under this section. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the assets of the retirement system attributable to amounts then credited to the medical benefit account shall not be used or diverted for any purpose other than providing medical benefits.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A separate account, designated as the "medical benefit administrative account", shall be maintained within the reserve for health benefits. Administrative costs of maintaining the medical benefit account shall be paid out of the medical benefit administrative account. Eligible judges making contributions to the medical benefit account consent as a condition of participation that transfers may be made from the subaccounts of each contributor to the medical benefit administrative account equal to no more than 25% of the earnings of funds on account in their respective subaccounts.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Upon becoming a member of Tier 1 or a qualified participant in Tier 2, and at such other times as the department shall permit, an eligible judge may elect to become a contributor and make contributions to the medical benefit account in an amount not to exceed the maximum contribution then permitted under subsection (5). Each eligible judge who is a member of Tier 1 or a qualified participant in Tier 2 may elect to make contributions to the medical benefit account during an election period of not less than 90 days as determined by the retirement system. Within the medical benefit account, the department shall maintain a subaccount for each contributor that reflects all contributions made by or for that contributor, adjusted for investment experience and payment of medical benefits. The employer of the contributor shall pick up the contributor's contributions in whole or in part and may require that its contributions be derived from a reduction in the contributor's cash salary. If the contributor's contributions are picked up by the employer on a salary-reduction basis, the contributor's election shall be irrevocable to the extent required by section 401(h) of the United States internal revenue code. Contributions picked up under this subsection on a salary-reduction basis are not included as gross taxable income of the contributor. The value of medical benefits provided from a contributor's subaccount shall not be included in the income of the retired contributor or the contributor's health benefit dependents.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The benefits to be provided from the medical benefit account, together with life insurance, if any, provided under the retirement system, are intended to be subordinate to retirement benefits under the retirement system. Accordingly, contributions in calendar years after 1999 credited to a contributor's subaccount, together with contributions, if any, that may be made to provide life insurance for the contributor under the retirement system, shall not exceed an aggregate amount equal to 1/3 of the contributions, including employee contributions, made for those years to provide a retirement allowance for the contributor under Tier 1 or Tier 2 of the retirement system. For purposes of applying a limitation established by this subsection, the retirement system may rely on an actuarial certification prepared by the actuary, demonstrating compliance, and reasonable actuarial assumptions selected by the actuary shall apply for purposes of determining the aggregate contributions for retirement allowances to be determined under this subsection. The retirement system shall determine the method, timing, and limits applicable to all contributors. In no case shall a determination made by the retirement system exceed the maximum provided by this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   All payments or reimbursements of medical benefits shall be charged against the balance of the retired contributor's subaccount. Payments or reimbursements shall not be made after the subaccount has been exhausted. Medical benefits to be provided from the medical benefit account shall consist of any of the following as applicable:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Payment of premiums for the retired contributor and the contributor's health benefit dependents under the state health plan, the state dental plan, and the state vision plan if the contributor and dependents are enrolled in any of those plans.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Payment or reimbursement of premiums or other charges for coverage of the retired contributor and the contributor's health benefit dependents under any group health plan within the meaning of section 5000(b)(1) of the United States internal revenue code.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Payment or reimbursement of premiums or other charges to obtain health insurance coverage within the meaning of section 9832(b)(1) of the United States internal revenue code for the retired contributor and the contributor's health benefit dependents.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Payment or reimbursement of expenses paid or incurred for the medical care, as defined in section 213(d)(1) of the United States internal revenue code, of the retired contributor and the contributor's health benefit dependents.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Payment or reimbursement of premiums, charges, and expenses shall be made only upon presentation of proper documentary evidence of amounts, dates of coverage or service, recipient of coverage or service, and such other information as the department shall require.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   While a contributor or retired contributor remains alive, the department shall comply with the contributor's written directions in regard to the type of medical benefits to be provided under this subsection and the allocation of the medical benefits among the retired contributor and the contributor's health benefit dependents if the directions comply with this subsection and the requirements of the department in regard to the form and content of the written directions. The department shall also afford each contributor the opportunity to give written directions in regard to the allocation of medical benefits to and among some or all of the contributor's surviving health benefit dependents following the contributor's death as designated on a beneficiary form developed by the retirement system. Upon death of the contributor and while funds remain in the contributor's subaccount, the department shall observe the written directions in allocating medical benefits among the contributor's surviving health benefit dependents, while giving the dependents or their legal representatives a reasonable opportunity to select the type of medical benefits to be provided. In the absence of valid written directions from the contributor in regard to the allocation of medical benefits following the contributor's death, the department shall allocate funds remaining in the contributor's subaccount to provide medical benefits to the contributor's surviving health benefit dependents, until all funds have been expended.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If there is a balance remaining in the subaccount of a contributor or retired contributor following the deaths of the contributor and all of the contributor's health benefit dependents, then that balance shall be forfeited and distributed to the medical benefit administrative account.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   As used in this section:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Contributor" means an eligible judge who has elected to make contributions to the medical benefit account created under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Eligible judge" means a judge of the circuit court, the district court, or the probate court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   "Former member" means an individual who was a member and who terminates employment upon which his or her membership is based for any reason.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   "Retired contributor" means a contributor who becomes a former qualified participant and attains the benefit commencement age, or who becomes a former member who either attains age 60 or meets the membership requirements for a retirement allowance under section 501(1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   Contributions shall not be picked up by this state pursuant to this section until the department receives notification from the United States internal revenue service that such contributions will not be included as gross income of the contributor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   This section does not apply until the department receives notification from the United States internal revenue service that the establishment of the medical benefit account under this section does not cause the retirement system to be disqualified for tax purposes.</DIV>

The state treasurer shall, if funds remain in the court fee fund after the transfer described in subsection (3), transmit a portion of the money in the court fee fund, not exceeding $2,200,000.00 in any fiscal year, to the court equity fund created by section 151b of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.151b. If the court fee fund exceeds $2,200,000.00 in any fiscal year and $2,200,000.00 is transmitted to the court equity fund, an amount may be appropriated from the court fee fund for operational expenses of trial courts. Operational expenses may include the payment of salaries of trial court judges other than judges of the district court. Any money remaining in the court fee fund at the end of the fiscal year shall remain in the court fee fund and shall not revert to the general fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, if the retirement board establishes an arrangement and fund described in section 6 of the public employee retirement benefit preservation act, the benefits that are required to be paid from that fund shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be paid from a portion of the money in the court fee fund and any earnings on those amounts or other eligible funds.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The state treasurer shall, if funds remain in the court fee fund after the transfer described in subsection (2), transmit a portion of the money in the court fee fund and any earnings on those amounts to the reserve for health benefits created by section 214 to pay expected health care costs for the subsequent fiscal year that are not covered as a result of employee contributions under sections 305(1) and 714(6), and to pay, in an amount not to exceed $100,000.00 in each fiscal year, any health care costs not paid from the reserve for health benefits since fiscal year 1996-1997.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Make an annual actuarial valuation of the retirement system in order to determine the actuarial condition of the retirement system and the required contribution to the retirement system.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Make an annual actuarial gain-loss experience study of the retirement system in order to determine the financial effect of variations of actual retirement system experience from projected experience.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The actuary shall compute the contribution rate for monthly benefits payable in the event of death of a member before retirement or the disability of a member using a terminal funding method of actuarial valuation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The actuary shall compute the contribution rate for benefits other than those described in subsection (2) using an individual projected benefit entry age normal actuarial cost method. The contribution rate for service that may be rendered in the current year, known as the normal cost contribution rate, is equal to the aggregate amount of individual entry age normal costs divided by l% of the aggregate amount of active members' valuation compensation. The contribution rate for unfunded service rendered on or before the last day of the fiscal year, known as the unfunded actuarial accrued liability contribution rate, is equal to the aggregate amount of unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities divided by l% of the actuarial present value over a period not to exceed 40 years of projected benefit compensation, where unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities are equal to the actuarial present value of benefits reduced by the actuarial present value of future normal costs and the actuarial value of assets on the last day of the fiscal year.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 503.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Upon retirement as provided in this act, the retirement system shall pay to the member or vested former member a straight life retirement allowance computed under subsection (2). If the member retires under the provisions of section 501(1)(d), the retirement system shall reduce the straight life retirement allowance as provided in section 501(1)(d). </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The retirement system shall calculate the member's or vested former member's straight life retirement allowance pursuant to 1 of the following plan member classifications, as applicable:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   For a plan 1 member, the retirement allowance is 30% of the member's or vested former member's final compensation plus 3-3/4% of the member's or vested former member's final compensation multiplied by the number of years and fraction of a year of credited service in excess of 8 years of credited service but not more than 16 years of credited service. A retirant shall not receive a retirement allowance under this subdivision that exceeds 60% of his or her final compensation. A plan 1 member who was holding his or her respective office on July 12, 1978, may elect to receive a retirement allowance under this section for an amount equal to or less than the computed benefit or to receive a retirement allowance computed under the state employees' retirement system created by the state employees' retirement act, Act No. 240 of the Public Acts of 1943, being sections 38.1 to 38.48 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   For a plan 2 member, a plan 3 member, or a plan 4 member who has less than 12 years of credited service, the retirement allowance is 3% of the member's or vested former member's final compensation multiplied by the member's or vested former member's years and fraction of a year of credited service. For a plan 2 member, a plan 3 member, or a plan 4 member who has 12 or more years of credited service, the retirement allowance is 50% of the member's or vested former member's final compensation plus 2.5% of the member's or vested former member's final compensation multiplied by the number of years and fraction of a year of credited service in excess of 12 years of credited service but not more than 16 years of credited service. A retirant shall not receive a retirement allowance under this subdivision that exceeds 60% of his or her final compensation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   For a plan 5 member, the retirement allowance is equal to the amount computed under subdivision (b) minus the amount of the straight life retirement allowance the member would have been entitled to receive or will receive from another publicly supported retirement plan as of August 31, 1981, based on the same judicial service accrued in the other publicly supported retirement plan as of August 31, 1981. The retirement system shall base the retirement allowance attributable to the same judicial service in another publicly supported retirement plan on service credit for service as a judge in that plan as a percent of total service credit in that plan.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   For a plan 6 member, the retirement allowance is 3% of the member's or vested former member's final compensation multiplied by the number of years and fraction of a year of credited service. A retirant shall not receive a retirement allowance under this subdivision that exceeds $15,000.00 or 40% of his or her final compensation, whichever is greater. A retirant shall not receive a retirement allowance under this subdivision that when added to a retirement benefit payable under a county retirement plan exceeds 66-2/3% of his or her final compensation. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   For a plan 7 member, the retirement allowance is equal to the amount computed under this subdivision. A retirant shall not receive a retirement allowance under this subdivision that exceeds 66-2/3% of his or her final compensation. The retirement allowance under this subdivision equals the sum of the following, as applicable: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   3.5% of the member's or vested former member's final compensation multiplied by the years and fraction of a year of service credited before January 1, 1983 for which the member or vested former member makes the 5% payment to the retirement system as provided in section 16(1)(d) of former Act No. 165 of the Public Acts of 1954, if any.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)    3% of the member's or vested former member's final compensation multiplied by the years and fraction of a year of service credited before January 1, 1983 for which the 5% payment described in subdivision (i) is not made, but not to exceed 40% of the member's or vested former member's final compensation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)    3.5% of the member's or vested former member's final compensation multiplied by the years and fraction of a year of service credited after December 31, 1982.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The retirement system shall pay a straight life retirement allowance to a retirant for his or her lifetime. Except as otherwise provided in section 508, the retirement system shall not make an additional retirement allowance payment upon the death of a retirant receiving a straight life retirement allowance other than the full month's retirement allowance payable for the month in which the retirant dies.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   At the time of retirement, a member or vested former member may elect to be paid an optional retirement allowance under an optional form of payment provided in section 506 in lieu of the straight life retirement allowance under this section.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a judge who is a plan 3 member shall convert $2,250.00 of the state salary standardization payment annually prescribed by law for any state fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1981 as an addition to the judge's state base salary for purposes of computation of a retirement allowance under this act. A judge who, within 30 days from taking office, files a written notice not to participate in the provisions of this subsection with the retirement system is exempt from this subsection. A judge who was serving on December 31, 1982 and who did not elect to convert $2,250.00 of the state salary standardization payment under section 14a of former 1951 PA 198 is exempt from this section. For the purposes of the calculation of a judge's combined county, city, or district control unit retirement benefit, a judge who has not filed a written notice not to participate in the provisions of this subsection with the retirement system under this subsection or the former judges retirement system shall have the $2,250.00 of the salary standardization payment subtracted from the final average compensation figure used to calculate the judge's county, city, or district control unit retirement benefit.</DIV>

A judge who, before April 1, 1983, or within 30 days from taking office, whichever is later, files a written notice not to participate in the provisions of this subsection with the retirement system is exempt from this subsection. For the purposes of the calculation of a judge's combined county, city, or district control unit retirement benefit, a judge who has not filed a written notice not to participate in the provisions of this subsection with the retirement system under this subsection or the former judges retirement system shall have the additional state salary standardization payment as an addition to the judge's state base salary for computation of a retirement allowance under this act subtracted from the final average compensation figure used to calculate the judge's county, city, or district control unit retirement benefit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The sum of the final compensation determined for each plan 3 member and the final average compensation figure used as the basis for determining the judge's retirement allowance as a member of a county retirement plan or a retirement system that was established pursuant to the municipal employees retirement act of 1984, 1984 PA 427, MCL 38.1501 to 38.1555, or that is subject to 1980 PA 443, MCL 38.841 to 38.846, shall not exceed the judge's total annual salary payable from all sources at the time of his or her retirement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   For purposes of subsections (1) and (2), the state base salary of a judge of the probate court who is a plan 3 member is equal to the salary paid pursuant to section 821 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.821.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 504a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A judge who is a plan 3 member may make the election prescribed in this subsection during the election period. A judge who makes the election under this subsection elects to convert the balance of the difference between the state base salary and the maximum statutory salary established by the revised judicature act that is not already converted under section 504. The election is effective on the conversion date and converts the described balance as an addition to the judge's state base salary for the purposes of computation of a retirement allowance under this act. The retirement system shall accept written elections from plan 3 members during the election period. A member who does not make a written election or who does not file the election during the election period remains at the same level of state salary standardization payment conversion previously elected under this section, if any. A member who files a written election during the election period also elects to convert the balance of the difference between the state base salary and the maximum statutory salary established by the revised judicature act that is not already converted under section 504 for all years of credited service through June 30, 1998. The retirement system shall determine the method by which a member shall make a written election under this subsection. Within 30 days after the request of a member, a reporting unit shall disclose to the member the effect an election under this subsection, if made, will have on the member's right as a retirant to health care benefits and any other benefits from that reporting unit. The election provided in this subsection is not intended to impair a member's right to receive health care benefits or other insurance benefits from a reporting unit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A member who makes the election under subsection (1) shall make a payment of an amount equal to the sum of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The actuarial cost of the conversion under subsection (1) as calculated by the retirement system, which shall be based upon methods adopted by the department and the retirement system's actuary in consultation with the retirement board.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The member contributions that would have been paid from July 1, 1999 through the conversion date, as if the member had made the conversion under subsection (1) and had been a plan 3c member as of July 1, 1999.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Interest on any amounts determined under subdivisions (a) and (b), from July 1, 1999 through the conversion date, based upon 8% effective annual interest, compounded annually.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The retirement system shall accept as full or partial payment of the amount required to be paid by a member under subsection (2) an amount determined and transferred by any tax-qualified plan or rollover IRA, if any, including the municipal employees retirement system, 1984 PA 427, MCL 38.1501 to 38.1555. Transfer under this subsection shall occur on or before the conversion date, unless extended by the department for good cause After receipt of the amount that is transferred to the retirement system under this subsection, the member shall pay to the retirement system under this subsection the balance of the amount due, if any, as calculated under subsection (2). Beginning with the pay period following the conversion date, the member shall pay the total amount due or the balance due, as appropriate, under subsection (2) by equal payments through deductions from compensation as provided in section 504 over a period not to exceed 100 pay periods. However, a member who files an application to retire and who has an outstanding balance due under subsection (2) shall pay the balance due on or before his or her retirement allowance effective date. A member may elect to have the deductions from compensation under this subsection be made on a salary reduction basis, which deductions shall be picked up by the member's employer. Contributions picked up under this section on a salary-reduction basis are not included as gross taxable income of the contributor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   As used in this section:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Conversion date" means the first pay period following December 31, 2000 or a date 90 days following the close of the election period, whichever is later.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Election period" means an election period of not less than 60 days as determined by the retirement system following the notification from the internal revenue service described in subsection (5).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   This section does not apply until the department receives notification from the United States internal revenue service that the conversion of the balance of the difference between the state base salary and the maximum statutory salary established by the revised judicature act under this section does not cause the retirement system to be disqualified for tax purposes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Contributions shall not be picked up by this state pursuant to this section until the department receives notification from the United States internal revenue service that such contributions will not be included as gross income of the member until they are distributed or made available to the member, retirant, retirement allowance beneficiary, or refund beneficiary.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 506.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Upon application for retirement under this act, a member or vested former member who meets the requirements of section 501 may elect to receive a retirement allowance as a straight life retirement allowance or as an optional retirement allowance under 1 of the payment options provided in this section. The member or vested former member shall file a written election with the retirement system before the effective date of the retirement allowance. If a member or vested former member fails to file a written election under this subsection, the member or vested former member is considered to have elected the straight life retirement allowance under section 503. The member or vested former member shall designate in the written election a retirement allowance beneficiary that shall be either the spouse, brother, sister, parent, or child, including an adopted child, of the member or vested former member. The amount of retirement allowance under options A and B are the actuarial equivalent of the amount of the straight life retirement allowance calculated under section 503. The options are as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Option A. The retirement system shall pay an optional retirement allowance to the retirant for life with the provision that upon the retirant's death, payment of the optional retirement allowance is continued throughout the lifetime of the retirement allowance beneficiary whom the member or vested former member designated in writing and filed with the retirement system at the time of election of the option.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Option B. The retirement system shall pay an optional retirement allowance for life to the retirant with the provision that upon the retirant's death, payment of 1/2 of the optional retirement allowance is continued throughout the lifetime of the retirement allowance beneficiary whom the member or vested former member designated in writing and filed with the retirement system at the time of election of the option.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a retirant shall not change the election of a payment option or the designation of a retirement allowance beneficiary under subsection (1) after the retirement allowance effective date. If a retirant who elected a payment option under subsection (1)(a) or (b) dies, the retirement system shall pay the optional retirement allowance to the option A beneficiary or option B beneficiary effective the first day of the month following the retirant's death. If the option A or option B beneficiary designated under this section is the surviving spouse of the deceased retirant, the surviving spouse may elect to receive a retirement allowance as provided in section 508 in lieu of the survivor portion of the optional form of payment elected by the retirant under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the option A beneficiary or option B beneficiary predeceases the retirant, the retirant's benefit reverts to a straight life retirement allowance and the retirement system shall begin payment of the straight life retirement allowance to the retirant effective the first day of the month following the option A or option B beneficiary's death.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The retirement system shall provide each member or vested former member who applies for retirement a written explanation of the optional forms of payment under this section before the member or vested former member retires.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a retirant receiving an optional retirement allowance under this section is divorced from the spouse who had been designated the option A or option B beneficiary, the retirement system shall consider the election of the optional form of payment option under this section void if the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, or an amended judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, described in the public employee retirement benefit protection act and dated after June 27, 1991 provides that the election of the optional form of payment option under this section is to be considered void by the retirement system and the retirant provides a certified copy of the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, or an amended judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, to the retirement system. If the election of an optional form of payment under this section is considered void by the retirement system under this subsection, the retirant's retirement allowance shall revert to a straight life retirement allowance, including postretirement adjustments, if any, subject to an award or order of the court as described in the public employee retirement benefit protection act. The retirement allowance shall revert to a straight life retirement allowance under this subsection effective the first of the month after the date the retirement system receives a certified copy of the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court. This subsection does not supersede a judgment of divorce or award or order of the court in effect on June 27, 1991. This subsection does not require the retirement system to distribute or pay retirement assets on behalf of a retirant in an amount that exceeds the actuarially determined amount that would otherwise become payable if a judgment of divorce had not been rendered.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A member who continues active employment on or after the date he or she acquires 8 years of credited service or who becomes eligible for a retirement allowance as a vested former member under section 501, whichever occurs first, may file a written election with the retirement system to elect option A as provided in subsection (1)(a). The member or vested former member shall nominate a retirement allowance beneficiary in the written election in the same manner as if the member or vested former member were then retiring from service. If the beneficiary's death or divorce from the member or vested former member occurs before the effective date of the member's or vested former member's retirement, the member's or vested former member's election of option A and nomination of retirement allowance beneficiary is automatically revoked and the member or vested former member may again elect option A and nominate a retirement allowance beneficiary at any time before the effective date of retirement. If a member or vested former member who has made an election and nominated a retirement allowance beneficiary as provided in this subsection dies before the effective date of his or her retirement, then the retirement allowance beneficiary shall receive the retirement allowance that he or she would have been entitled to receive under option A if the member or vested former member had been retired on the date of the member's or vested former member's death. Except as otherwise provided by subsection (7), if a member or vested former member who has made an election under this subsection subsequently retires under this act, his or her election of option A takes effect at the time of retirement. The member or vested former member, before the effective date of retirement, but not after the effective date of retirement, may revoke his or her previous election of option A and elect to receive his or her retirement allowance as a straight life retirement allowance or under option B as provided for in subsection (1). This subsection does not apply on and after the date the settlement agreement in the case of Michigan judges assn v Treasurer of the State of Michigan, case no. 98-DT-72771-CV (Ed Mi), becomes of no further force or effect, is rendered null and void, or is otherwise terminated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If a member, vested former member, retiring member, or retiring vested former member is married on the effective date of the retirement allowance, an election under this section, other than an election of a payment option under subsection (1) naming the spouse as retirement allowance beneficiary, shall not be effective unless the election is signed by the spouse. However, this requirement may be waived by the retirement board if the signature of a spouse cannot be obtained because of extenuating circumstances. As used in this subsection, "spouse" means the person to whom the member, vested former member, retiring member, or retiring vested former member is married on the effective date of the retirement allowance.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    A member who has 8 or more years of credited service and who is physically or mentally totally disabled to perform his or her duties is entitled to retire due to disability as provided in this section. A member who has 8 or more years of credited service agrees to submit himself or herself to a medical examination by or under the direction of the medical adviser as required by the retirement board under this subsection. Upon written application for retirement due to disability filed with the retirement system by the member, the chairperson of the judicial tenure commission, or the chief justice of the supreme court, the retirement board shall request that the member submit to a medical examination by or under the direction of the medical adviser.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The medical adviser, after a medical examination of the member, shall determine if the member is physically or mentally totally disabled to perform his or her duties, if the incapacity is likely to be permanent, and if the member should be retired due to disability. The medical adviser shall file a written report of the medical adviser's findings and shall certify his or her determination to the retirement system. The retirement board shall notify the member of the medical adviser's determination under this subsection by registered mail sent to his or her last known residence address.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The member, before the expiration of 30 days after the date of the notice by the retirement board under subsection (2), may file a written notice to appeal the medical adviser's determination with the retirement system. If a notice to appeal the medical adviser's determination is filed by the member under this subsection, the retirement board shall establish a medical committee to hear the appeal. The medical committee consists of a physician appointed by the retirement board, a physician appointed by the member, and a physician appointed by the first 2 physicians appointed under this subsection. The medical committee, after a medical examination of the member, shall determine if the member is physically or mentally totally disabled to perform his or her duties, if the incapacity is likely to be permanent, and if the member should be retired due to disability. The medical committee shall file a written report of the medical committee's findings and shall certify the medical committee's determination to the retirement system. The retirement board shall notify the member of the medical committee's determination under this subsection by registered mail sent to his or her last known residence address. The determination by a majority of the medical committee is binding upon the retirement system and the member.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A member who refuses to submit to a medical examination required under this section and the refusal continues for 90 days or more; or a member for whom it is determined under this section that he or she should retire due to disability and who fails to retire before the expiration of 60 days after the retirement board sends notice of that determination under subsection (2) or (3), whichever is later, forfeits for himself or herself and his or her heirs and beneficiaries all rights in and to retirement benefits under this act except the refund of accumulated contributions.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a member who has 8 or more years of credited service dies while in office or if a vested former member dies before retirement, the retirement system shall pay the following retirement allowance as applicable:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If a member with 8 or more years of credited service dies while in office, or if a vested former member dies before retirement, and the member has an election of option A in force as provided in section 506(6), then the retirement allowance beneficiary shall receive the retirement allowance that he or she would have been entitled to receive under option A if the member or vested former member had been retired on the date of the member's or vested former member's death.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If a member with 8 or more years of credited service dies while in office, or if a vested former member dies before retirement, and the member or vested former member does not have an election of option A in force as provided in section 506(6), and leaves a surviving spouse, the spouse shall receive a retirement allowance computed in the same manner as if the member had retired effective the day before the date of his or her death, elected option A, and nominated the spouse as retirement allowance beneficiary.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the deceased vested former member had met the service requirements of section 501(1)(d), the surviving spouse may elect to receive a permanently reduced retirement allowance equal to the amount the deceased vested former member would have received as reduced by section 501(1)(d).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a retirant dies, the retirement system shall pay the following retirement allowance as applicable:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the retirant elected a straight life retirement allowance under section 506, the surviving spouse shall receive 1/2 the amount of the retirement allowance computed under section 503, based upon the deceased member's final compensation and credited service.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the retirant elected an optional retirement allowance under section 506, the retirement allowance beneficiary shall receive a retirement allowance as provided under section 506(1)(a) or (b).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the deceased member, vested former member, or retirant does not leave a surviving spouse or if the surviving spouse dies after the member's, vested former member's, or retirant's death, the retirement system shall pay to each of the member's, vested former member's, or retirant's unmarried children under the age of 19 years a retirement allowance equal to an equal share of the amount of the retirement allowance payable to a surviving spouse under subsection (1)(b) or subsection (3)(a).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The retirement system shall begin payment of a retirement allowance under this section to a surviving beneficiary of a deceased member or retirant under this section on the first day of the month following the month in which the member or retirant dies. The retirement system shall begin payment of a retirement allowance to a surviving beneficiary of a deceased vested former member on the first day of the month following the month in which the vested former member otherwise would have been eligible to begin receiving benefits under section 501. The retirement system shall terminate payment of a retirement allowance to a surviving beneficiary upon the surviving beneficiary's death.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The retirement system shall begin payment of a retirement allowance to a child of a deceased member or retirant under this section on the first day of the month following the month in which the member or retirant dies without a surviving spouse or the first day of the month following the month in which the surviving spouse dies, whichever is later. The retirement system shall begin payment of a retirement allowance to a child of a deceased vested former member under this section on the first day of the month following the month in which the vested former member dies, the first day of the month following the month in which the vested former member could have retired under section 501 if there is no surviving spouse, or the first day of the month following the month in which the surviving spouse of the vested former member dies, whichever is later. The retirement system shall terminate payment of a retirement allowance to a child upon his or her adoption, marriage, becoming 19 years old, or death, whichever occurs first. However, the retirement system shall continue payment of a retirement allowance to a child who is attending school full-time during the period of full-time school attendance, but in no case beyond the child becoming 25 years old. Upon termination of a child's retirement allowance under this subsection, the retirement system shall divide that portion of the retirement allowance into equal shares and add it to the retirement allowance being paid to the remaining eligible children, if any, effective the first day of the month following termination of payment to the ineligible child.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The retirement system shall not pay a retirement allowance under this section if an optional retirement allowance is being paid or will become payable to an option A beneficiary or option B beneficiary under section 506 or if a refund of accumulated contributions is paid under section 405.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The surviving spouse of a deceased member may elect a refund of accumulated contributions in lieu of a retirement allowance under this section. The surviving spouse of a deceased retirant may elect to be paid a retirement allowance under this section in lieu of the survivor portion of the optional form of payment elected by the retirant under section 506.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) This section is enacted under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, which imposes certain administrative requirements and benefit limitations for qualified governmental plans. This state intends that the retirement system be a qualified pension plan created in trust under section 401 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, and that the trust be an organization exempt from taxation under section 501 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 501. The department shall administer the retirement system to fulfill the intent of this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The retirement system shall be administered in compliance with the provisions of section 415 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, and regulations under that section that are applicable to governmental plans and, beginning January 1, 2010, applicable provisions of the final regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service on April 5, 2007. Employer-financed benefits provided by the retirement system under this act must not exceed the applicable limitations set forth in section 415 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, as adjusted by the commissioner of internal revenue under section 415(d) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, to reflect cost-of-living increases, and the retirement system shall adjust the benefits, including benefits payable to retirants and retirement allowance beneficiaries, subject to the limitation each calendar year to conform with the adjusted limitation. For purposes of section 415(b) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 415, the applicable limitation applies to aggregated benefits received from all qualified pension plans for which the office of retirement services coordinates administration of that limitation. If there is a conflict between this section and another section of this act, this section prevails.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The assets of the retirement system must be held in trust and invested for the sole purpose of meeting the legitimate obligations of the retirement system and must not be used for any other purpose. The assets must not be used for or diverted to a purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members, vested former members, retirants, and retirement allowance beneficiaries before satisfaction of all retirement system liabilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The retirement system shall return post-tax member contributions made by a member and received by the retirement system to a member on retirement, under Internal Revenue Service regulations and approved Internal Revenue Service exclusion ratio tables.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The required beginning date for retirement allowances and other distributions must not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee attains age 70-1/2 or April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee retires. The required minimum distribution requirements imposed by section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, apply to this act and must be administered in accordance with a reasonable and good faith interpretation of the required minimum distribution requirements for all years in which the required minimum distribution requirements apply to this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the retirement system is terminated, the interest of the members, vested former members, retirants, and retirement allowance beneficiaries in the retirement system is nonforfeitable to the extent funded as described in section 411(d)(3) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 411, and related Internal Revenue Service regulations applicable to governmental plans.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act to the contrary that would limit a distributee's election under this act, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the retirement board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. This subsection applies to distributions made after December 31, 1992.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) For purposes of determining actuarial equivalent retirement allowances under sections 506(1)(a) and (b) and 602, the actuarially assumed interest rate must be determined by the director of the department and the retirement board in consultation with the actuary using the mortality tables adopted by the department and the retirement board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the compensation of a member of the retirement system must be taken into account for any year under the retirement system only to the extent that it does not exceed the compensation limit established in section 401(a)(17) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, as adjusted by the commissioner of internal revenue. This subsection applies to an individual who first becomes a member of the retirement system after September 30, 1996.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, contributions, benefits, and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided under the retirement system in accordance with section 414(u) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 414. This subsection applies to all qualified military service after December 11, 1994. Beginning on January 1, 2007, in accordance with section 401(a)(37) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 401, if a member dies while performing qualified military service, for purposes of determining any death benefits payable under this act, the member is treated as having resumed and then terminated employment on account of death.</div>

<P>Sec. 702.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    For a member who elects to terminate membership in Tier 1 under section 701(1), the retirement system shall direct the state treasurer to transfer a lump sum amount from the appropriate fund created under this act to the qualified participant's account in Tier 2 on or before October 31, 1998. The retirement system shall calculate the amount to be transferred, which shall be equal to the sum of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The member's accumulated contributions, if any, from the reserve for member contributions as of 12 midnight June 30, 1998.</DIV>

Except as provided in subsection (5), for the purposes of this subsection, the present value of the member's accumulated benefit obligation is based upon the member's estimated credited service and estimated final salary as of 12 midnight on June 30, 1998. The actuarial present value shall be computed as of 12 midnight June 30, 1998 and shall be based on the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Eight percent effective annual interest, compounded annually.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)    A 50% male and 50% female gender neutral blend of the mortality tables used to project retirant longevity in the most recent actuarial valuation report.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Interest on any amounts determined in subdivisions (a) and (b), from July 1, 1998 to the date of the transfer, based upon 8% annual interest, compounded annually.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For each member who elects to terminate membership in the retirement system under section 701(1), the retirement system shall recompute the amount transferred under subsection (1) not later than December 31, 1998 based upon the member's actual credited service and actual final salary as of 12 midnight June 30, 1998. If the recomputed amount differs from the amount transferred under subsection (1) by $10.00 or more, not later than January 15, 1999, the retirement system shall do all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Direct the state treasurer to transfer from the reserve for employer contributions to the qualified participant's account in Tier 2 the excess, if any, of the recomputed amount over the previously transferred amount together with interest from 12 midnight June 30, 1998 to the date of the transfer under this subsection, based upon 8% effective annual interest, compounded annually.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   For a vested former member who elects to terminate membership in this retirement system under section 701(2), the retirement system shall direct the state treasurer to transfer a lump sum amount from the appropriate fund created under this act to the qualified participant's account in Tier 2 on or before the expiration of 60 days after the date of the individual's termination of employment.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The excess, if any, of the actuarial present value of the vested former member's accumulated benefit obligation, over the amount specified in subdivision (a), from the reserve for employer contributions. Except as provided in subsection (5), for the purposes of this subsection, the present value of the vested former member's accumulated benefit obligation is based upon the vested former member's estimated credited service and estimated final salary as of 12 midnight on the last day of the payroll period that includes the date of the election. The actuarial present value shall be computed as of 12 midnight on that date and shall be based on the following:</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) One irrevocable trust is authorized and created by this act for each retirement system. An irrevocable trust established under this subsection shall at all times be established and administered in accordance with section 115 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 115.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The governing board of each retirement system shall be the grantor and shall administer the irrevocable trust created for that retirement system in order to pay retirement health care benefits to its past members and their funding account dependents and reimburse medical expenses to its past members and their health reimbursement account dependents. The members of the retirement system board shall act as the trustees of the irrevocable trust for that retirement system. The trustees shall adopt a written trust agreement that meets all of the requirements set forth in section 9. The trustees of the irrevocable trust may establish and adopt policies and procedures for administering the irrevocable trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Each trust shall be managed and operated separately and independent of the other retirement system trusts. The trustees may contract with public and private entities for the provision of bookkeeping, benefit payments, and other plan functions. The department, the department of treasury, and the department of the attorney general shall provide services to the trust as requested by the trustees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the assets in the irrevocable trusts shall be invested in accord with the public employee retirement system investment act, 1965 PA 314, MCL 38.1132 to 38.1140m. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the state treasurer shall be the investment fiduciary of the irrevocable trusts and shall have exclusive authority and responsibility to employ or contract with personnel and for services that the state treasurer determines necessary for the proper investment of the assets in the irrevocable trusts. The board of trustees of the Michigan legislative retirement system created under the Michigan legislative retirement system act, 1957 PA 261, MCL 38.1001 to 38.1080, may elect, or revoke an election, to be the investment fiduciary of the funding account assets within its irrevocable trust and retain the exclusive authority to employ or contract with personnel and for services that are necessary for the proper investment of those assets. This subsection does not apply to assets contributed or credited to a health reimbursement account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Each trust shall receive state appropriations, employer contributions, mandatory contributions, voluntary contributions, investment earnings, refunds and reimbursements, and other permitted deposits, and shall make distributions for the payment of retirement health care benefits and reimbursement of medical expenses authorized by the trustees for the administration of such trust. However, an amount in excess of twice the annual current obligations of the trust shall not be deposited in or received by the trust unless the state treasurer certifies that the proposed deposit will not materially reduce the amount of federal funds received by this state to support payments made under the social welfare act, 1939 PA 280, MCL 400.1 to 400.119b. The trustees are authorized to establish an administrative and investment fee structure to be charged against the funding account and the health reimbursement accounts within the trust to defray the costs of administering the trust.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A funding account shall be established by the trustees for the funding and prefunding of payments of retirement health care benefit obligations under the applicable retirement act, and the trustees may create accounts that the trustees determine are necessary for the administration of the trust. For each retirement system, past members shall have contractual rights only in the aggregate to the payment of retirement health care benefits provided by the applicable retirement act to the extent assets exist in the funding account for that retirement system. This act shall not be construed to define or otherwise assure, deny, diminish, increase, or grant any right or privilege to retirement health care benefits or other postemployment benefits to any person or to assure, deny, diminish, increase, or grant retirement health care benefits or other postemployment benefits, rights, and privileges previously or already granted to members or past members and their dependents by the applicable retirement act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The governing board of a retirement system may from time to time authorize the deposit into the funding account of any eligible funds on deposit in an account within its retirement system for the purpose of payment of eligible retirement health care benefits.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The trustees shall cause the annual financial statements of the trust to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and an audit to be conducted of those financial statements by a qualified independent certified accounting firm for each fiscal year in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Health reimbursement accounts shall be established and maintained within each irrevocable trust to receive and hold the amounts contributed under section 10. All health reimbursement accounts shall be established in a manner that complies with all applicable statutory provisions, regulatory provisions, and internal revenue service rulings governing health reimbursement arrangements, including, but not limited to, section 105(b) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 105, internal revenue notice 2002-45, and internal revenue rulings 2005-24 and 2006-36.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A separate prefunding account may be established by the trustees for the prefunding of amounts to be contributed or credited by this state to health reimbursement accounts under the applicable retirement act.
