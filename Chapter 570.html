<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Any person, firm or corporation, who shall by any contract or contracts, express or implied or partly expressed and partly implied with the owner, part owner or lessee of any leasehold, for oil and gas purposes or of any gas pipe line or oil pipe line, or with one whom such owner, part owner or lessee has authorized or knowingly permitted to contract in his or their behalf for the drilling, boring, torpedoing, acidizing, completing, operating or repairing of any oil or gas well or for the constructing or repairing of any oil or gas derrick, oil tank, gas pipe line or oil pipe line, perform any labor or furnish any materials, machinery, tools, equipment, fuel, explosives, acid, or oil or gas well supplies or other things of value used in the drilling, torpedoing, acidizing, completing, operating or repairing of any oil or gas well, or who shall furnish any oil or gas well supplies, or other things of value or perform any labor in constructing or putting together any of the apparatus, fixtures or machinery used in the drilling, boring, torpedoing, acidizing, operating, completing or repairing of any oil or gas well, or who shall furnish any material, equipment, machinery, supplies or other things of value or perform any labor for constructing, operating or repairing any oil pipe line or gas pipe line, oil or gas derrick or oil tank, shall have a lien upon such leasehold, oil and gas produced from said leasehold, oil well, gas well, lease for oil and gas purposes, oil or gas derrick, oil tank, oil pipe line, gas pipe line, buildings, fixtures, appurtenances, and upon the material, tools, machinery and supplies or other things of value so furnished, and upon the oil and gas fixtures, machinery and appliances used in operations for oil and gas purposes upon the leasehold or premises for which said material and supplies were furnished or labor performed, for the amount due to him, it or them for such materials, machinery, tools, equipment, fuel, explosives, acid, or oil or gas well supplies, services or labor or other things of value and shall be entitled to interest at the legal rate from the date the same is due. These liens shall extend to a life estate, an estate for years, or any other estate or any right of redemption or other interest which such owner, part owner, or lessee may have in such leasehold at the time of making such contract or may subsequently acquire therein, and to an estate in fee when the owner or part owner thereof drills or develops said land for oil or gas purposes. Such liens shall follow the property and each and every part thereof and be enforceable against the said property wherever the same may be found and shall attach as of the date on which the first of such materials are furnished or labor performed under the contract. The taking of any note or additional security by any party entitled to such lien for the amount so due or any part thereof shall not be a waiver of any right of lien which such party may have by virtue of this act unless made a waiver by express agreement of the parties. Materials or other items for which such lien is given which are furnished by the same contractor to the same owner or to the successors or assigns of such owner for operations on same premises or leasehold, which are delivered on separate orders given at various times shall, for the purpose of this act be considered as having been furnished under a single contract: Provided, That not more than 3 months shall have elapsed between the date of delivery of any such item and the date of the last preceding delivery of materials therefor. There may be additional and successive contracts upon which additional liens may be recorded as herein provided. In no event shall it be necessary to fix or stipulate in any contract a time for the completion or a time for payment in order to obtain a lien under this act.</DIV>

The original contractor shall, whenever any payment of money shall come due from the owner, part owner, or lessee or whenever he desires to draw any money from the owner, part owner, or lessee on such contract, make out and give to the owner, part owner, or lessee, or his agent, a statement under oath, of the number and name of every sub-contractor or laborer in his employ, and of every person furnishing the materials, giving the amount if anything, which is due or to become due to them or any of them for work done or materials furnished, and the owner, part owner or lessee or his agent may retain out of any money then due or to become due to the contractor, an amount sufficient to pay all demands that are due or to become due to such sub-contractors, laborers, and material men, as shown by the contractor's statement, and pay the same to them according to their respective rights, and all payments so made shall, as between such owner, part owner, or lessee, and such contractor, be considered the same as if paid to such original contractor.

If neither such owner, part owner, lessee, or his agent can be found within the county, then it shall not be necessary for the contractor to make and deliver such statement as a prerequisite to the institution of proceedings under this act, or other suit or proceeding. In order that the owner, part owner, or lessee may be protected, he may at any time during the progress of the work demand in writing of the contractor, the statement herein provided for, which shall be made by the contractor and given to the owner, part owner, or lessee, or his agent, and if such contractor fail to furnish such statement within 5 days after demand made, he shall be liable to such owner, part owner, or lessee, each time he so refuses or neglects to comply with such demand, in the sum of 100 dollars, and also for all actual damages occasioned by such neglect or refusal, to be recovered in an action on the case or in any other appropriate proceeding. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Proceedings to enforce such lien shall be by bill in chancery, under oath, and notice of lis pendens recorded in the office of the register of deeds, shall have the effect to continue such lien pending such proceedings. And in such proceedings, the complainant shall make all persons having rights in said leasehold estate affected or to be affected by such liens so recorded in the office of the register of deeds, and all persons holding like liens so recorded, parties to such action. And all persons holding like liens or any other persons having rights in said leasehold estate, may make themselves parties thereto on motion to the court and notice to complainant and may file their intervening or cross bills or answers claiming the benefit of cross bills and notices of lis pendens therein. The practice and procedure in such suit shall be the same as in other cases in chancery and the court shall thereupon settle and determine the rights and liabilities of all of the parties in the matter, and make such decree as may be required to determine and enforce the rights and liabilities of the various parties. Upon final decree the court may order a sale of the leasehold estate, oil or gas well, oil or gas derrick, oil tank, oil or gas pipe lines, machinery, fixtures or appurtenances, together or separately, by a circuit court commissioner or receiver, or may order the property into the hands of a receiver to be leased or rented from time to time under the direction of the court until the liens shall be discharged, or make such other order or disposition of the premises as justice may require. If upon coming in and confirmation of the final report any portion of the liens shall still be unpaid, the court may enter personal decree for the same against the party or parties who may be personally liable therefor, and the execution shall issue for the same as upon other personal decrees rendered. The costs in all cases shall be subject to the discretion of the court and shall be paid out of the proceeds of the sale or by any parties to the suit as justice and equity may require.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 3.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided in this act, a garage keeper who, in pursuance of a contract that is expressed, implied, written, or unwritten, furnishes labor, material, storage, diagnosis, an estimate of repairs, or supplies for a vehicle, shall have a lien upon the vehicle for the charges due for the storage, maintenance, keeping, diagnosis, estimate of repairs, and repair of the vehicle and for gasoline, electric current, or other accessories and supplies furnished, expenses bestowed, or labor performed on the vehicle at the request or with the consent of the owner of the vehicle. If a vehicle remains in the possession of a garage keeper after the completion of repairs or after a diagnosis and subsequent storage of the vehicle when repairs are not authorized, a garage keeper's lien attaches to the vehicle in the manner and amount provided in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The lien attaches to the vehicle on the day the garage keeper performs the last labor or furnishes the last supplies for which a lien is claimed against the vehicle. The garage keeper may keep a vehicle for not more than 225 days after performing the last labor or furnishing the last supplies for which a lien is claimed against the vehicle.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The portion of a lien that is for labor and material furnished in making repairs upon a vehicle has priority over all other liens upon the vehicle. The lien has no effect against the holder of a security interest, conditional sales agreement, or other lien that attached before the attachment of the garage keeper's lien upon the payment by a prior lienholder to the garage keeper of the amount of the lien calculated under subsection (4) and section 4.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Except as provided in section 4, the maximum amount of a lien that a prior lienholder shall pay a garage keeper under this section is calculated as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If a repaired vehicle has a market value of more than $5,000.00, then the amount of the lien shall be not more than 20% of the market value of the repaired vehicle or $5,000.00, whichever is less.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If a repaired vehicle has a market value of $5,000.00 or less, then the amount of the lien shall be not more than $1,000.00.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 5.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A lien under section 3 shall be enforced only as provided in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If charges described in section 3 are not paid, the garage keeper may sell the vehicle at a public sale described in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   To enforce a lien under section 3, a garage keeper or authorized agent shall, not more than 105 days after the date the lien attached as provided in section 3, apply to the department, in a format prescribed by the department, for a certificate of foreclosure of garage keeper's lien and bill of sale accompanied by a fee of $10.00 paid to the department.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A statement that all lienholders are being notified of the delinquency, that a lienholder has the right to satisfy the garage keeper's lien plus any storage charges provided for under section 4 and obtain possession of the vehicle as provided in section 5(8), and that a lienholder is required to notify the garage keeper before the proceeds are distributed under section 6 if the lienholder desires to claim any of the proceeds from the sale of the vehicle under section 6(1)(a).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A statement of daily storage fees, if any.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   A statement of the date, time, manner, and place that the vehicle will be sold.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the sale shall be held not less than 75 calendar days after the date placed on the certificate of foreclosure of the garage keeper's lien and bill of sale by the department. The bureau may object to a sale only if it has reason to believe that the garage keeper has failed to substantially comply with this act, the rules promulgated under this act, the motor vehicle service and repair act, 1974 PA 300, MCL 257.1301 to 257.1340, or the rules promulgated under the motor vehicle service and repair act, 1974 PA 300, MCL 257.1301 to 257.1340, in the repair transaction involving the vehicle that is the subject of the lien. If the bureau objects to the sale within the 75-day period, all of the following conditions shall apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The bureau shall complete an investigation of its objection within 150 calendar days after the date placed on the certificate of foreclosure of the garage keeper's lien and bill of sale by the department.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Upon completion of the investigation or the expiration of the 150-calendar-day period, whichever occurs first, the bureau shall do 1 of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Remove the objection to the sale.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Complete service upon the garage keeper of a written notice of alleged violation that alleges a specific violation of the motor vehicle service and repair act, 1974 PA 300, MCL 257.1301 to 257.1340, or the rules promulgated under that act, and extends the bureau's objection to the sale indefinitely until resolution under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The garage keeper may, within 10 days after the personal service or postmarked date of the notice of alleged violation, notify the bureau, in writing, that the garage keeper wants to contest the notice of alleged violation. If the garage keeper contests the notice, the bureau shall conduct an immediate review of its reasons for the objection. After this review, the bureau shall do 1 of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Remove the objection to the sale.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   If the objection is sustained, the bureau shall, in writing, offer the garage keeper an opportunity to have the bureau's objection resolved under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, as a contested case proceeding under the motor vehicle service and repair act, 1974 PA 300, MCL 257.1301 to 257.1340. If a contested case proceeding is pursued under this section, the bureau may include in that proceeding's complaint any other outstanding alleged repair act or rule violation against the garage keeper that may be pursued through a contested case proceeding. If the garage keeper fails to respond to the offer for a contested case proceeding within 10 days of receiving the offer from the bureau, the bureau's objection to the lien shall be deemed permanent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Storage charges provided for under this act shall not accrue during the period that the bureau objects to the sale.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The 225-day period provided for in section 3(2) shall be extended by the number of days that the bureau objects to the sale.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A sale of the vehicle shall be held at the facility of the garage keeper or at the nearest suitable place.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Before a sale of a vehicle pursuant to this section, the owner or owners may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien, in addition to the reasonable expenses or fees incurred by the garage keeper under this act, and redeem the vehicle. Upon receipt of this payment, the garage keeper shall return the vehicle to the owner or owners in the same condition, or substantially the same condition, as the vehicle was in when the lien attached under section 3(1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Not less than 30 calendar days after the garage keeper's notice is mailed to the owner or owners, and prior to the sale, a lienholder may pay the garage keeper the amount of the garage keeper's lien as calculated under sections 3(4) and 4, or another amount to which the lienholder and garage keeper agree. Upon receipt of this payment, the garage keeper shall return the vehicle to the lienholder in the same condition, or substantially the same condition, as the vehicle was in when repairs were completed and it was stored by the garage keeper or, if no repairs were authorized by the owner, in the same condition or substantially the same condition, as the vehicle was in when it was received by the garage keeper. If the garage keeper performed diagnostic tests on the vehicle for which a lien is claimed, the garage keeper shall include a written explanation of the results of the diagnostic tests performed when the garage keeper returns the vehicle to the lienholder. The amount of a payment made under this section shall be added to the amount of the prior lienholder's lien.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)    The amount payable to the garage keeper shall not exceed the market value of the vehicle.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   Upon the public sale of a vehicle under this act, the garage keeper shall complete the certificate described in subsection (3) as indicated on its face and give the completed certificate to the purchaser of the vehicle. In addition to other information that may be required by the secretary of state, the purchaser shall submit this certificate to the department when making an original application for a certificate of title or a vehicle registration for the vehicle in the name of the purchaser.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   The garage keeper may bid for and purchase the vehicle at the sale. If the garage keeper directly or indirectly purchases the vehicle at the sale, the lien granted under this act is extinguished in full.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   A person who in good faith buys a vehicle at a sale conducted pursuant to this act takes the vehicle free of a security interest created by the seller even though the security interest is perfected and even though the buyer knows of its existence.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A facility owner has a possessory lien on property stored at that facility for storage, rent, labor, repairs, maintenance services, materials, supplies, and other charges and for expenses reasonably incurred in the sale of that property under this act. Except as provided in subsection (8), a lien on property under this section takes priority over any prior lien on the property unless the prior lienholder pays to the facility owner the amount of the lien attributable to storage, labor, materials, supplies, or other charges reasonably incurred in the sale of the property under this act or the following applicable amount, except as otherwise provided in this section, whichever is less: </div>

However, this subsection does not apply to auxiliary propulsion or trolling engines.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The amount calculated under subsection (1) must be reduced by 1/2 if more than half of the expenditure for labor and materials was attributable only to the repair or replacement of 1 of the following:</div>

After that 30-day period, the lien includes all repair, service, or storage charges incurred, including, but not limited to, those incurred during the 30-day period.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) To the extent that the proceeds of sale exceed the sum of the items described in subdivisions (a) to (c), the facility owner shall pay the surplus to the property owner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If, after satisfying the reasonable expenses of the sale and the lien under subsection (2), there is a dispute concerning the priority of record lienholders under subsection (2), the facility owner may hold the proceeds of the sale until the dispute is settled by the written agreement of the parties or until an order or final judgment is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction relative to the dispute. The facility owner may pay the proceeds of sale to a court with subject matter jurisdiction. After a facility owner pays the proceeds to a court as described in this subsection, the facility owner is relieved of all further obligation concerning the proceeds.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If proceeds of the sale under this section are not sufficient to satisfy the property owner's outstanding obligations to the facility owner or any lienholder of record, the property owner remains liable to the facility owner or lienholder for the deficiency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Before conducting a sale under this section, and within a reasonable time after default has continued for more than 180 days, the facility owner shall do both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Mail a notice of default to the property owner and the secretary of state by certified mail or by another commercially available delivery service that provides proof of delivery, and, if the property is registered in another state or with a federal agency, mail a notice by certified mail to the other state or federal agency responsible for registration or documentation of the property. If the property is a vessel or trailer, the secretary of state shall provide the facility owner with the name and address of the registered owner of the vessel or trailer and a list of all lienholders. If the owner of property cannot be determined because of the condition of identification numbers or because a check of the records of the secretary of state or, if applicable, an agency of another state or federal agency does not reveal ownership, the facility owner may send notice of default by certified mail or by another commercially available delivery service that provides proof of delivery to the person that delivered the property to the facility, if known, at the person's last known address and shall publish in the print or electronic version of a newspaper of general circulation a notice that contains a description of the property and the information required to be provided in a notice of default. The facility owner shall provide a copy of the notice of default to each lienholder of record provided by the secretary of state. The notice of default must include all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A statement that the property is subject to a lien held by the facility owner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A statement of the facility owner's claim indicating the charges due on the date of the notice, the amount of any additional charges that will become due before the date of sale, and the date the additional charges will become due.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) A demand for payment of the charges due within a specified time not less than 30 days after the date the notice is delivered to the property owner and all lienholders of record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) A statement that the property will be sold if the claim is not paid within the time stated in the notice. The statement must include the time and location of the sale.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) The name, street address, and telephone number of the facility owner, or the facility owner's designated agent, whom the property owner may contact to respond to the notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) After the expiration of the 30-day period set forth in subdivision (a)(iii), publish an advertisement of the sale once a week for 2 consecutive weeks in the print or electronic version of a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the sale is to be held. The advertisement must include a general description of the property, the name of the property owner, and the time and location of the sale. The date of the sale must be not less than 15 days after the date the first advertisement of the sale is published.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) At any time before the sale of property under this act, any lienholder may cure the default by paying the amount of the claim to the facility owner, which amount must be added to the lien of the lienholder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A sale under this act must be held at the facility or at another reasonable location.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A person who purchases property sold at a commercially reasonable sale under this act takes the property free and clear of the rights of the property owner and all lienholders of record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A facility owner who complies with this act is liable as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The facility owner's liability to a lienholder of record is limited to the net proceeds received from the sale of the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The facility owner's liability to the property owner is limited to the net proceeds received from the sale of the property after payment in full of all lienholders of record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A property owner or lienholder who suffers damages because of a facility owner's failure to comply with this act may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for his or her actual damages or $250.00, whichever is greater.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A facility owner is limited to 1 lien under state law against a property for the storage, labor, repairs, maintenance services, materials, or supplies for the property. A facility owner who asserts a lien against a property under another statute or the common law shall not also assert a lien under this act for the same storage, labor, repairs, maintenance services, materials, or supplies, or other charges or expenses related to the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A facility owner may deny a property owner who has been notified under subsection (5) access to the storage facility, except that the property owner is entitled to access to the facility during normal business hours for the purpose of satisfying the lien or viewing and verifying the condition of the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Except as otherwise provided in this act, all notices required by this act must be mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. Notices to a facility owner must be mailed to the owner's business address or to the address of the owner's designated representative. Notices to a property owner must be mailed to the property owner's last known address as listed on the title, registration, or other marine documentation or as provided in the most recent agreement concerning storage, labor, repairs, maintenance services, materials, or supplies entered into between the facility owner and the property owner. Notices to a lienholder of record must be sent to the address of the lienholder as provided by the secretary of state under subsection (5). Notices are considered delivered on the date the recipient of the notice signs the return receipt or, if the notice is undeliverable, the date the post office last attempts to deliver the notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) The facility owner may bid all or a portion of his or her claim at the auction sale of the property.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The owner of a self-service storage facility or a self-contained storage unit and the heirs, personal representatives, successors, and assignees of the owner have a lien upon all personal property, whether or not owned by the tenant, located at the self-service storage facility or self-contained storage unit for rent or other lawful charges incurred relative to the storage of the personal property, including expenses necessary for its preservation, or reasonably incurred in its sale pursuant to this act. The lien attaches on the date the personal property arrives at the self-service storage facility or self-contained storage unit or the date a rental agreement for the storage space is signed by the tenant, whichever is earlier.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The priority of a lien under this act is as provided in section 5(14).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a tenant defaults on a rental agreement, the owner shall give notice to all holders of a perfected security interest under the uniform commercial code, 1962 PA 174, MCL 440.1101 to 440.11102, in which the tenant is named as a debtor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) At the commencement of a rental agreement for storage space at a self-service storage facility or in a self-contained storage unit, the owner shall provide the tenant with the following written notice:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>"NOTICE: If you fail to make your required payments, you will have to vacate the unit or your property may later be sold at a public sale. Before the sale, you will be notified by first-class mail or by electronic mail of the amount due. The notice will be mailed to your last known address. In order to preserve your right to be notified, it is important that you notify us in writing of any change in your mailing address. Also, you should supply us with the name and address of another person who can reach you if you are not at your mailing address, and we will notify that person at the same time and in the same manner as we notify you.".</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A rental agreement under this section may provide for a limit on the value of the property stored at the facility or unit. The stated limit shall be considered the maximum value of the stored property for all purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A rental agreement under this section may provide for a reasonable late charge for failure of the tenant to timely make payments for the storage space when due. A monthly late fee of $20.00 or 20% of the monthly rental amount, whichever is greater, shall be considered reasonable and is not a penalty. The owner of the self-service storage facility or self-contained storage unit has the burden of justifying the reasonableness of any higher late fee.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An owner's lien under section 3 shall be enforced only as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The tenant and any occupant designated by the tenant under section 4(2) shall be notified of the owner's intent to enforce the owner's lien by written notice delivered in person, by first-class mail, or by electronic mail to the tenant's and, if applicable, occupant's last known address. The notice shall include all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An itemized statement of the owner's claim, showing the amount due at the time of the notice and the date when the amount became due.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A demand for payment within a specified time not less than 14 days after delivery of the notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A conspicuous statement that, unless the claim is paid within the time stated in the notice, the personal property will be advertised for sale or other disposition and will be sold or otherwise disposed of at a specified time and place as provided in subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The name, street address, and telephone number of the owner whom the tenant may contact to respond to the notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A statement that if the tenant is a service member and is transferred or deployed overseas on active duty for a period of 180 days or more, the tenant is entitled to give the owner notice of that transfer or deployment and is entitled to protections under this act or other law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A notice under this section is presumed delivered when it is deposited with the United States postal service and properly addressed with postage prepaid or when it is transmitted by electronic mail to the tenant's last known electronic mail address. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Subject to subsection (16), after the expiration of the time given in the notice described in subsection (2), the contents of the storage space may be moved to another storage space pending its sale or other disposition under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) After the expiration of the time given in the notice described in subsection (2), except as provided in subsection (6), an advertisement of the sale or other disposition shall be published once a week for 2 consecutive weeks in the print or electronic version of a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the self-service storage facility or self-contained storage unit is located or posted once per week for 2 consecutive weeks on a publicly available website identified in the rental agreement. Regardless of whether a sale involves the property of more than 1 tenant, a single advertisement may be used to advertise the disposal of property at the sale. An advertisement under this section shall include all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A brief, general inventory, as described in subsection (7), of the personal property subject to the lien that is to be sold.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The address of the self-storage facility or the address where the self-contained storage unit is located and the name of the tenant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The time, place, and manner of the sale or other disposition. Subject to subsection (16), the sale or other disposition shall not take place sooner than 15 days after the first publication of the advertisement under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If there is no newspaper of general circulation in the area where the self-service storage facility or self-contained storage unit is located and a publicly available website is not identified in the rental agreement, the advertisement shall be posted not less than 10 days before the date of the sale or other disposition in not less than 3 conspicuous places in the neighborhood where the self-service storage facility or self-contained storage unit is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The inventory required under subsection (5) shall reasonably identify the property. A container, including, but not limited to, a trunk, valise, or box that is locked, fastened, sealed, or tied in a manner that deters immediate access to its contents may be described as being in that condition, and a description of the container's contents is not required. However, a container closed in such a manner may be opened and its contents inventoried, and those conducting the inventory, the owner, and the owner's employees, agents, and representatives are not liable for incidental damage to the container caused by the inventory.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A sale or other disposition of personal property under this section shall conform to the terms of the notification as provided in this section and shall be conducted in a commercially reasonable manner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Before a sale or other disposition of personal property under this section, the tenant may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred under this section to redeem the personal property. Upon receipt of the redemption amount, the owner shall return the personal property to the tenant. After returning the personal property to the tenant under this subsection, the owner is not liable to any person concerning that personal property. If the tenant fails to redeem the personal property or satisfy the lien, including reasonable expenses under this section, the tenant shall be considered to have unjustifiably abandoned the personal property and the owner may resume possession of the self-service storage facility or self-contained storage unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If any property to which a lien attaches under section 3 is a motor vehicle, aircraft, mobile home, moped, motorcycle, snowmobile, trailer, or watercraft and the rent and other storage charges remain unpaid or unsatisfied for 60 days, the owner may, in lieu of a sale of the property, have the property towed from the facility by an independent motor carrier with a proper certificate of authority from the Michigan public service commission under the motor carrier act, 1933 PA 254, MCL 475.1 to 479.43. An owner who has property towed under this subsection is not liable or responsible for the property after the transfer of possession of the property to the motor carrier.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Before the sale of a motor vehicle, aircraft, mobile home, moped, motorcycle, snowmobile, trailer, or watercraft, the owner shall contact the secretary of state and any other governmental agency as reasonably necessary to determine the name and address of the title holders or lienholders of the item, and the owner shall notify every identified title holder or lienholder of the time and place of the proposed sale. The owner is liable for notifying the holder of a security interest only if the security interest is filed under the name of the person signing the rental agreement, the tenant, or an occupant identified in section 4(2). An owner who fails to make the lien searches required by this section is liable only to valid lienholders injured by that failure as provided in section 6.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Before the sale of personal property under this act, a holder of a prior lien on a motor vehicle, aircraft, mobile home, moped, motorcycle, snowmobile, trailer, or watercraft to be sold may pay the owner the amount of the owner's lien attributable to storage of the property, including the reasonable expenses incurred by the owner under this section. The amount payable to the owner shall not exceed the equivalent of 4 months' rent. A payment made to the owner shall be added to the amount of the lien of the prior lienholder who made the payment and shall be subtracted from the amount of the owner's lien.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) A purchaser in good faith of the personal property sold under this section takes the property free of any right of a person against whom the lien was valid, despite noncompliance by the owner with the requirements of this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) A person conducting a sale under this section shall distribute the proceeds in the following sequence:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) First, to satisfy the owner's liens up to an amount equivalent to 4 months' rent, minus any amount already paid the owner pursuant to subsection (12).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Second, to satisfy outstanding balances owed to prior perfected lienholders.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Third, to satisfy the balance of the owner's liens, including, but not limited to, all unpaid rent, late fees, and reasonable lien enforcement expenses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) Any proceeds of a sale under this section remaining after the distribution is made under subsection (14) shall be returned to the tenant by mailing the proceeds to the tenant's last known address by certified mail and by notifying the tenant by first-class mail. If the tenant does not claim the remaining proceeds within 2 years after the date of sale, the remaining proceeds shall escheat to this state. The owner shall maintain proper records of money received in any sale held under this section, and the records are subject to audit by the department of treasury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) If an owner receives a notice with supporting evidence under section 4(3) from a tenant, the owner shall not enforce an owner's lien until 90 days after the end of the tenant's overseas service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) An owner is not liable for any damages or claims related to the release, use, or misuse of confidential, proprietary, or personal identification information contained in any documents or other media stored by a tenant in the facility or unit after the sale or other disposition of the documents or media.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) If an owner reasonably believes that a storage space contains any documents or other media containing confidential, proprietary, or personal identification information, the owner is authorized to destroy any or all of the documents or media in lieu of a sale under this section. An owner who destroys documents or media under this subsection is not liable to any person for the destruction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) If an owner has actual knowledge of, and the storage space contains, any property that the owner may not lawfully sell, the owner is authorized to properly dispose of the property in any manner allowed by applicable law in lieu of a sale under this section. An owner who disposes of property under this subsection is not liable to any person for the disposal.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>570.1107 Construction lien generally.</B><P>Sec. 107.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Each contractor, subcontractor, supplier, or laborer who provides an improvement to real property has a construction lien upon the interest of the owner or lessee who contracted for the improvement to the real property, as described in the notice of commencement given under section 108 or 108a, the interest of an owner who has subordinated his or her interest to the mortgage for the improvement of the real property, and the interest of an owner who has required the improvement. A construction lien acquired pursuant to this act shall not exceed the amount of the lien claimant's contract less payments made on the contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A construction lien under this act attaches to the entire interest of the owner or lessee who contracted for the improvement, including any subsequently acquired legal or equitable interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Each contractor, subcontractor, supplier, or laborer who provides an improvement to real property to which the person contracting for the improvement had no legal title has a construction lien upon the improvement for which the contractor, subcontractor, supplier, or laborer provided labor, material, or equipment. The forfeiture, surrender, or termination of any title or interest held by an owner or lessee who contracted for an improvement to the property, an owner who subordinated his or her interest to the mortgage for the improvement, or an owner who has required the improvement does not defeat the lien of the contractor, subcontractor, supplier, or laborer upon the improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the rights of a person contracting for an improvement as a land contract vendee or a lessee are forfeited, surrendered, or otherwise terminated, any lien claimant who has provided a notice of furnishing or is excused from providing a notice of furnishing under section 108, 108a, or 109 and who performs the covenants contained in the land contract or lease within 30 days after receiving actual notice of the forfeiture, surrender, or termination is subrogated to the rights of the contracting vendee or lessee as those rights existed immediately before the forfeiture, surrender, or termination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) For purposes of this act, if the real property is owned or leased by more than 1 person, there is a rebuttable presumption that an improvement to real property under a contract with an owner or lessee was consented to by any other co-owner or co-lessee. If enforcement of a construction lien through foreclosure is sought and the court finds that the improvement was consented to by a co-owner or co-lessee who did not contract for the improvement, the court shall order the entire interest of that co-owner or co-lessee, including any subsequently acquired legal or equitable interest, to be subject to the construction lien. A deficiency judgment shall not be entered against a noncontracting owner, co-owner, lessee, or co-lessee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the real property of an owner or lessee is subject to multiple construction liens, the sum of the construction liens shall not exceed the amount the owner or lessee agreed to pay the person with whom he or she contracted for the improvement as modified by all additions, deletions, and other amendments, less payments made by or on behalf of the owner or lessee, pursuant to either a contractor's sworn statement or a waiver of lien, in accordance with this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) After the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection, a construction lien of a subcontractor or supplier for an improvement to a residential structure shall only include an amount for interest, including, but not limited to, a time-price differential or a finance charge, if the amount is in accordance with the terms of the contract between the subcontractor or supplier and the contractor or subcontractor and does not include any interest that accrues after 90 days after the claim of lien is recorded.</div>

From the amount withheld, the owner or lessee may directly pay subcontractors, suppliers, or laborers the amount they are due as shown by the sworn statement. If the contract provides for payments by the owner to the general contractor in the normal course of construction, but the owner elects to pay lien claimants directly under this section, the first time the owner elects to make payment directly to a lien claimant, he or she shall provide at least 5 business days' notice to the general contractor of the intention to make direct payment. Subsequent direct disbursements to lien claimants need not be preceded by the 5-day notice provided in this section unless the owner first returns to the practice of paying all sums to the general contractor.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A lien claimant who receives partial payment for his or her contract shall provide to the owner, lessee, or designee a partial unconditional waiver of the lien for the amount which the lien claimant has received, if the owner, lessee, or designee requests the partial unconditional waiver.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Subject to subsection (8), if the improvement is provided to property that is a residential structure, an owner, lessee, or designee shall not rely on a full or partial unconditional or conditional waiver of lien provided by a person other than the lien claimant named in the waiver if the lien claimant has either filed a notice of furnishing under section 109 or is excused from filing a notice of furnishing under section 108 or 108a unless the owner, lessee, or designee has first verified the authenticity of the lien waiver with the lien claimant either in writing, by telephone, or personally.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 116.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The claim of lien of a contractor, subcontractor, supplier, or laborer may at any time be vacated and discharged if a bond, with the lien claimant as obligee, is filed with the county clerk for the county in which the property covered by the lien is located and a copy is given to the obligee lien claimant. The bond shall be in the penal sum of twice the amount for which the lien is claimed and shall be conditioned on the payment of any sum for which the obligee in the bond may obtain judgment on the claim for which the claim of lien was filed. The bond may be either a cash bond executed by a principal, or a surety bond executed by a principal and a surety company authorized to do business in this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Within 10 days after receiving the bond, the county clerk shall notify each lien claimant that a bond has been filed and indicate the amount of the bond and the name of the surety on the bond. The lien claimants shall have 10 days after being notified of the bond within which to file an objection to the sufficiency of the surety on the bond, in which case the county clerk shall not approve the bond until the surety has appeared before the county clerk and answered under oath those questions asked by or on behalf of the lien claimant touching on the surety's financial responsibility. If an objection to the surety is not filed within the 10 days after being notified of the bond or if the county clerk approves the bond after the questioning of the surety, the county clerk shall at once give to the principal and the obligee named in the bond a certificate that a good and sufficient bond has been filed in accordance with this act. The certificate shall state the names of the obligor and obligee, the amount of the bond, and the description of the property covered by the claim of lien being discharged. Upon the recording of the certificate in the office of the register of deeds where the claim of lien was recorded, the claim of lien of the obligee lien claimant named in the claim of lien shall be discharged. If because of the pendency of proceedings to enforce the claim of lien, a notice of lis pendens has been recorded, the recording of the certificate shall also operate as a discharge of the notice of lis pendens. The obligee may make any obligor on the bond a party to an action to enforce a claim under the bond, and a judgment may be recovered in the action against all or any of the obligors.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In an action brought in connection with the claim of the obligee, the court may do 1 or more of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Order the amount of the bond to be reduced.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Order other or additional surety to be provided.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Grant any other relief the court considers to be equitable.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   As provided in section 111(6), an action to foreclose on a construction lien may be maintained by an agent appointed to represent laborers. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Each person who, at the time of filing the action, has an interest in the real property involved in the action which would be divested or otherwise impaired by the foreclosure of the lien, shall be made a party to the action.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   In an action brought by a contractor or subcontractor to enforce a construction lien through foreclosure, the complaint, cross-claim, or counterclaim must show that the owner or lessee was provided a sworn statement, if a sworn statement was requested or required, pursuant to section 110.</DIV>

The court also may allow reasonable attorneys' fees to a prevailing defendant if the court determines the lien claimant's action to enforce a construction lien under this section was vexatious.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided by subsection (4), as between parties entitled to claim construction liens under this act, the liens have equal priority. This subsection applies and the construction liens have equal priority regardless of whether the lien arises at the time of the first actual physical improvement or at the time a notice is recorded under section 107a or 107b.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A construction lien under this act has priority over all garnishments for the contract debt made after the lien arises, without regard to the date of recording of the claim of lien.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A construction lien arising under this act has priority over all other interests, liens, or encumbrances that may attach to the building, structure, or improvement, or on the real property on which the building, structure, or improvement is erected, if the other interests, liens, or encumbrances are recorded after the construction lien arises.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A mortgage, lien, encumbrance, or other interest recorded before the construction lien arises has priority over a construction lien arising under this act. The priority of the mortgage exists as to all obligations secured by the mortgage except for indebtedness arising out of advances made after the construction lien arises. An advance made pursuant to the mortgage, but after the construction lien arises, has priority over a construction lien if, for that advance, the mortgagee has received a contractor's sworn statement as provided in section 110, has made disbursements pursuant to the contractor's sworn statement, and has received waivers of lien from the contractor and all subcontractors, laborers, and suppliers who have provided notices of furnishing. The construction lien of a lien claimant not set forth on the sworn statement on which an advance was made is subordinate to the lien of the mortgage, including the advance, unless before the advance the lien claimant provided the designee with a notice of furnishing if required by section 109 or recorded a claim of lien. An advance made after a notice of furnishing has been provided or has been excused as provided in sections 108, 108a, and 109 or after a claim of lien has been recorded is subordinate to the construction lien of the lien claimant unless before the advance the mortgagee received from the lien claimant either a full unconditional waiver of lien or a partial unconditional waiver of lien for the full amount due the lien claimant as of the date through which the lien is waived as shown on the lien waiver and the date through which the lien is waived as shown on the partial unconditional waiver is within 30 days before the advance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) For purposes of this section, retainage that is not payable under a contract until a certain event happens in addition to an improvement being provided, is not due as of the date the improvement is provided.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For purposes of determining priorities under this section, a construction lien arises as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), at the time of the first actual physical improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) As to a lien claimed by a person after the person has recorded a notice under section 107a or 107b, at the time a notice is recorded, subject to any applicable limitation under section 107a(4) or 107b(4).</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If a lien claimant, by reason of the failure of an owner or lessee to perform the contract, and without fault on the part of the lien claimant, has been prevented from completely performing the contract, the lien claimant shall be entitled to compensation for as much as was performed by the claimant under the contract, in proportion to the price stipulated for complete performance of the whole contract, less any payments made to the lien claimant and also to any additional damages which the lien claimant may be entitled to as a matter of law.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 121.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    If the court finds that a lien claimant is entitled to a construction lien upon the real property to which he or she furnished an improvement, and the amount adjudged to be due has not been paid, the court may enter a judgment ordering the sale of any interest in the real property, or a part of the real property, to which the construction lien attaches. If the construction lien attaches only to the improvement furnished, the court may order a sale of the improvement. If the court finds that there is an interest in or encumbrance against the real property which is superior to the construction lien being foreclosed, the order for sale shall indicate that fact. The court may order a construction lien satisfied out of the rents, profits, and income from the real property to which the construction lien has attached.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In a judgment of foreclosure, the court may provide for adding to the amount determined to be due any amount paid by any lien claimant, mortgagee, or receiver appointed by the court, after the foreclosure sale and before the expiration of the period of redemption, for taxes assessed against the real property sold or for that portion of the premium of an insurance policy covering the building located on the real property, which premium portion is required to keep the policy in force until the expiration of the period of redemption. After the making of any tax or premium payments, an affidavit with respect to the payments shall be recorded immediately in the office of the register of deeds for the county in which the deed on foreclosure sale was recorded.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In the order for the foreclosure sale, the court shall fix a period for redemption. The period of redemption shall not exceed 4 months. The sale shall be conducted in the same manner as a sale on execution. The sale shall become final, subject to the period of redemption, upon the entry of an order of confirmation by the court. Pursuant to section 119(3) and subject to subsection (1), the foreclosure, upon becoming final, shall vest in the grantee named in the deed all the right, title, and interest in the real property which the owner, co-owner, lessee, or co-lessee whose interest is being foreclosed had at the date of the execution of the contract or at any time thereafter. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The court shall enter a final order directing the distribution of all of the funds obtained from the foreclosure sale in accordance with the priorities of the parties as determined by the court. The court shall adjudicate the rights, if any, of lien claimants to a deficiency judgment against any owner or lessee contracting for an improvement. After the making of all payments directed by the court, any surplus from the proceeds of the sale of property on the foreclosure of a construction lien under this act shall be paid over to the owner, co-owner, lessee, co-lessee, or such other person as may be entitled to the surplus. However, the surplus shall be subject to a subsequent judgment or execution under this act in the same manner as if the surplus was derived from a sale made under the subsequent execution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If all claims of lien are not ascertained when a sale is ordered, or if for any other reason it is deemed proper to postpone the order of distribution of the proceeds of a sale on foreclosure, the court may direct the party making the sale to bring the proceeds of the sale into court, to be disposed of according to order of the court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Redemption from a foreclosure sale is complete upon payment of all sums set forth in the judgment of foreclosure, together with any sums due for the payment of taxes or insurance premiums as provided in subsection (2). If there is not a redemption from the foreclosure sale, taxes and insurance premiums paid after the sale shall not be included in any deficiency judgment.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 122.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    If the improvement to the real property is not completed as of the date of commencement of an action in which enforcement of a construction lien through foreclosure is sought or in any action to foreclose a mortgage on the real property on which the incomplete improvement exists, any lien claimant or mortgagee may petition the court for the appointment of a receiver. The petition shall be heard as a motion. A receiver may be appointed by the court upon finding that a substantial unpaid construction lien exists, or that the mortgage on the real property is in default and that the lien claimant, the mortgagee, or both, are likely to sustain substantial loss if the improvement is not completed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   When making an appointment of a receiver under this section, the court shall give consideration to the nominations of the mortgagee and the lien claimant. Any receiver appointed under this section shall be deemed a fiduciary for the benefit of all persons having or claiming interests in the real property, and shall exercise his or her office accordingly.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A receiver shall not be appointed under this section for any residential structure, nor for any apartment building containing 4 or less apartments.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The receiver shall be entitled to possession of the real property upon his or her appointment.

<P>Sec. 123.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The receiver may petition the court for authority to complete construction of improvements to the real property in full or in part, to borrow money to complete the construction, and to grant security, by way of mortgage or otherwise, for the borrowings. The priority of the security shall be determined by the court. A petition for authority to complete construction of improvements shall not be granted unless the court finds that the value added to the real property which will result from the construction is likely to exceed the cost of the additional construction, including all estimated overhead and administrative costs, together with interest on any funds that are to be borrowed for the construction. The receiver also may be authorized by the court to borrow funds for other purposes, including such purposes as preserving and operating the real property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The receiver may petition the court for authority to sell the real property interest under foreclosure for cash or on other terms as may be ordered by the court. The sale may be by private or public sale and shall be held in the manner directed by the court. A sale under this subsection shall become final upon the entry of an order of confirmation by the court, unless the court allows a period for redemption.

Repayment of funds borrowed by the receiver, under court authority, for the completion of improvements, or for any other purpose shall have priority in the distribution, unless a different priority has been ordered by the court.
