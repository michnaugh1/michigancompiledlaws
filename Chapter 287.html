<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A person that wants to obtain a license under this act to act as a dealer, broker, agent, or livestock trucker, or to operate a livestock auction, buying station, or collection point shall submit to the department an application for a license. The application must state the nature of the business, the post office address of the applicant, the post office address at or from which the business is to be conducted, and any additional contact information. If the applicant desires to operate a livestock yard where livestock are kept and sold at public or private sale, the application must include that information. The application must include additional information as requested by the director.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, until October 1, 2027, the department shall charge the following nonrefundable fees for initial and renewal license applications: 
<B></B><table>

  </table><B></B>(3) Each class of license listed in subsection (2) allows a person to operate at all classes listed below that class without requiring additional licensing. The licensee shall provide to the department a list of all individuals employed by and operating in license classes under the individual's license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) For each renewal application postmarked or delivered after October 1 of each year, a late fee of $10.00 must be imposed for each business day the application is late. The late fee for a new application submitted after a person is operating as a class I, II, III, or IV operation as described in subsection (2) is $10.00 per business day the application is late. The total late fee must not exceed $100.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The department shall deposit administrative and noncriminal fines received under this act and license or other administrative fees received under this section into the agriculture licensing and inspection fees fund created in section 9 of the insect pest and plant disease act, 1931 PA 189, MCL 286.209, to be used, on appropriation, by the department in administering and carrying out its duties under this act. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A licensee that buys or sells livestock by weight shall employ a weighmaster to do all of the weighing. The department shall establish the duties, qualifications, and requirements for registration of weighmasters in the rules promulgated under section 9.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The department must issue an initial or renewal license under this section not later than 60 days after the applicant submits a completed application. Receipt of the application is considered the date the application is received by the department. If the department considers the application incomplete, the department shall notify the applicant in writing or electronically, within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The 60-day period is tolled on notification by the department of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the department. A determination of completeness does not operate as an approval of the application for the license and does not confer eligibility of an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the department fails to issue or deny a license within the time required by this section, the department shall return the license fee and reduce the license fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. The failure to issue a license within the time required under this subsection does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and that application, on completion, must be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based on the fact that the license fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An application for a license or the renewal of a license, and proof of bonding or other security requirements, must be submitted to the director on or before October 1 of each year. A license issued under this section is valid for a period of 1 year commencing October 1 and ending the following September 30.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A person that operates a livestock auction or buying station must file, with the application for a license, a surety bond effective during the period for which the license is issued or other security. The surety bond must be issued by a surety company registered in this state to indemnify persons from whom livestock is purchased or for whom livestock is sold. The surety bond or other security must be in the amount, form, and sufficiency approved by the director. The amount of the bond or other security must be equal to the amount of gross dollar volume of livestock business conducted during the average week of the previous licensing year by the applicant, but must not be less than $1,500.00. If the average gross weekly livestock business conducted by the applicant during the previous licensing year was greater than $25,000.00, the bond must be increased above $25,000.00, at the rate of $1,000.00 for each $5,000.00 or part thereof above $25,000.00 of average gross dollar volume of weekly livestock business conducted during the previous year. A licensee who owns or operates more than 1 livestock auction or buying station may file 1 bond in an amount determined by the formula described in this subsection. A licensee that operates a livestock auction or buying station who has filed a surety bond for the livestock auction or buying station and indemnifies persons from whom livestock is purchased or for whom livestock is sold in accordance with the terms of any federal act is exempt from the bonding requirements of this subsection if the bond is equivalent in amount to that which would be required by this act. The department shall be the obligee on the bond for the benefit and purpose of protecting all persons selling or consigning livestock to the licensee against the licensee's failure to pay amounts due on livestock purchased by or consigned to them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A licensee shall keep records and furnish, on request, information concerning the licensee's purchases and sales as may be required by the director for the purpose of establishing the amount of bond required under subsection (10). The director, in establishing the amount of the bond, shall take into consideration the dollar volume of livestock business and other information furnished by the licensee. If a licensee did not operate a livestock auction the previous licensing year, the bond must be for an amount established by the director after consideration of all information available on the probable weekly gross dollar volume of business to be conducted by the licensee during the licensing year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If during a licensing year the bond filed by a licensee becomes less than required by this act because of an increase in gross dollar volume of livestock sales, or because of a claim outside this state, the director may issue an order requiring the licensee to file an additional bond to cover the increase in gross dollar volume of livestock sales. Failure to comply with the orders of the director is grounds for suspension or revocation of license. A bond or other security must be conditioned on the faithful performance of the licensee's duties as a dealer or broker and on the provisions of law relating to the purchase of livestock by the licensee and for the payment by the licensee of all livestock purchased by or consigned to the licensee as a dealer or broker in livestock. If a bond or other security required under this act is canceled, the license that is approved under that bond or other security is considered immediately suspended without notice. An opportunity for a hearing must be provided to the licensee under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) A licensee bonded as required under this act must submit a notice to the department not later than 60 days before canceling a bond. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) A license issued under this section allows the holder to conduct the business of dealer or broker at or from the place named in the application. A person engaged in the business of transporting livestock or negotiating or soliciting the transportation or transfer of livestock that is not engaged in the buying, selling, reselling, exchanging, negotiating, or soliciting the sale, resale, or exchange of livestock must obtain a license under this section but is not required to comply with the bonding or other security provisions of this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) A dealer, broker, livestock trucker, or agent shall notify the director of a change of address within 5 days after that change. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) A licensee shall report to the director a change in ownership of a livestock auction within 5 days of that change.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) A dealer or broker shall file with the director on January 1 of each year a sworn statement of average weekly sales and a statement showing the number and species of livestock purchased and sold during the previous year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) As used in this section, "completed application" means an application complete on its face and submitted with the applicable licensing fees as well as any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule of a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private entity but not of another department or agency of this state. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the department shall waive any fee otherwise required under subsection (2)(c) or (d) if the individual responsible for paying the fee is, and provides proof satisfactory to the department that the individual is, an honorably discharged veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Each licensee operating a livestock auction or buying station, in addition to providing a bond as required by this act, shall maintain a "producers' proceeds account". Within 7 calendar days following each livestock auction, the licensee shall deposit in the producers' proceeds account funds equal to the total amount of money due the livestock sellers or consignors of livestock sold or consigned through the livestock auction. Failure to make such deposits in their entirety is a violation of this section. The director shall audit from time to time the producers' proceeds account and ascertain whether the provisions of this section are being complied with. All records of the licensee shall be made available to the director for the purposes of auditing the account. The entire sale price of livestock sold through the auction less commissions, handling charges, service fees and other accepted charges shall be placed in the producers' proceeds account and shall be used to pay the seller or consignor for the livestock and for no other purpose.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A licensee shall ensure that all pens used for confinement of animals with a contagious or infectious disease are in a location that prevents contact with healthy animals. The pens shall be of smooth tight siding construction and of sufficient height that they will not permit the contact of any other livestock. The pens shall be drained in such a manner as to prevent contamination of the alley. Pens used for livestock infected with contagious or infectious diseases shall be properly identified and shall not be used to confine any other livestock.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Except upon a permit from the director, swine shall not be sold or removed from a livestock auction, collection point, or buying station except for immediate slaughter.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The owner of a dog that is 4 or more months old shall apply to the treasurer of the county or, except as provided in section 14, the treasurer of the township or city where the owner resides, or to the treasurer's authorized agent, for a license for each dog owned or kept by him or her.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Unless the county board of commissioners adopts a resolution under subsection (3), the owner shall apply for a license annually on or before March 1.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The county board of commissioners of a county may adopt a resolution during the 60-day period before the beginning of the county's fiscal year providing when the owner of a dog that is required to be licensed under subsection (1) must apply for a license. Before adopting the resolution, the county board of commissioners shall obtain the county treasurer's written approval of the resolution. Subject to subsection (4), the resolution shall provide for 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That the owner apply for a license by March 1 every year or every third year, at the owner's option.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That the owner apply for a license by June 1 every year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) That the owner apply for a license by June 1 every year or every third year, at the owner's option.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) That the owner apply for a license by the last day of the month of the dog's current rabies vaccination, every year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) That the owner apply for a license by the last day of the month of the dog's current rabies vaccination, every third year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) That the owner apply for a license by 1 of the following, at the owner's option:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The last day of the month of the dog's current rabies vaccination every year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The last day of the month of the dog's current rabies vaccination, every third year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A resolution adopted under subsection (3) shall include necessary provisions for conversion to a new licensing schedule. The resolution may extend the effective period of outstanding licenses but shall not shorten the effective period of outstanding licenses or prorate license fees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The application shall state the breed, sex, age, color, and markings of the dog, and the name and address of the last previous owner. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the application for a license shall be accompanied by a valid certificate of a current vaccination for rabies, with a vaccine licensed by the United States department of agriculture, signed by an accredited veterinarian. The certificate for vaccination for rabies shall state the month and year of expiration for the rabies vaccination, in the veterinarian's opinion. If the application for a license is submitted electronically, the owner of the dog is not required to provide a valid certificate of a current vaccination for rabies if the dog was licensed the previous year and the dog's current rabies vaccination on record with the treasurer of the county or, except as provided in section 14, the treasurer of the township or city where the owner resides, or the treasurer's authorized agent, is still valid. A license shall not be issued under subsection (3)(d), (e), or (f) if the dog's current rabies vaccination will expire more than 1 month before the date on which that license would expire. When applying for a license, the owner shall pay the license fee provided for in the county budget. The county board of commissioners may set license fees in the county budget at a level sufficient to pay all the county's expenses of administering this act as it pertains to dogs. For a spayed or neutered dog, the license fee, if any, shall be set lower than the license fee for a dog that is not spayed or neutered. In addition, the license fee may be set higher for a delinquent application than for a timely application.</div>

<P>Sec. 10.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   For the purposes of this act, a kennel shall be construed as an establishment wherein or whereon 3 or more dogs are confined and kept for sale, boarding, breeding or training purposes, for remuneration, and a kennel facility shall be so constructed as to prevent the public or stray dogs from obtaining entrance thereto and gaining contact with dogs lodged in the kennel. Any person who keeps or operates a kennel may, in lieu of individual license required under this act, apply to the county treasurer for a kennel license entitling him to keep or operate a kennel. Proof of vaccination of dogs against rabies shall not be required with the application. The license shall be issued by the county treasurer on a form prepared and supplied by the director of the department of agriculture, and shall entitle the licensee to keep any number of dogs 6 months old or over not at any time exceeding a certain number to be specified in the license. The fee to be paid for a kennel license shall be $10.00 for 10 dogs or less, and $25.00 for more than 10 dogs. A fee of double the original license fee shall be charged for each previously licensed kennel, whose kennel license is applied for after June 1. With each kennel license the county treasurer shall issue a number of metal tags equal to the number of dogs authorized to be kept in the kennel. All the tags shall bear the name of the county issuing it, the number of the kennel license, and shall be readily distinguishable from the individual license tags for the same year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The county treasurer or county animal control officer shall not issue a kennel license for a new kennel under the provisions of this act unless the applicant furnishes an inspection certificate signed by the director of the department of agriculture, or his authorized representative, stating that the kennel to be covered by the license complies with the reasonable sanitary requirements of the department of agriculture, and that the dogs therein are properly fed and protected from exposure commensurate with the breed of the dog. The director of the department of agriculture shall promulgate reasonable rules with respect to the inspections in the manner prescribed by law. The inspection shall be made not more than 30 days before filing the application for license. The provisions of this act shall not be effective in the counties of this state that are operating under the provisions of section 16 wherein the board of supervisors have appointed a county animal control officer with certain powers and duties, unless the counties by a resolution duly adopted by the board of supervisors accept the provisions of this act.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 20.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If a person sustains any loss or damage to livestock or poultry that is caused by dogs, or if the livestock of a person is necessarily destroyed because of having been bitten by a dog, the person or his or her agent or attorney may complain to the township supervisor or a township officer or other qualified person designated by the township board of the township in which the damage occurred. The complaint shall be in writing, signed by the person making it, and shall state when, where, what, and how much damage was done, and, if known, by whose dog or dogs. The township supervisor or a township officer or other qualified person designated by the township board shall at once examine the place where the alleged damage was sustained and the livestock or poultry injured or killed, if practicable. He or she shall also examine under oath, or affirmation, any witness called. After making diligent inquiry in relation to the claim, the township supervisor or a township officer or other person designated by the township board shall determine whether damage has been sustained and the amount of that damage, and, if possible, who was the owner of the dog or dogs that did the damage. If during the course of the proceedings the owner of the dog causing the loss or damage to the livestock becomes known, the township supervisor or a township officer or other person designated by the township board shall request the district court judge to immediately issue a summons against the owner commanding him or her to appear before the township supervisor or township officer or other person designated by the township board and show cause why the dog should not be killed. The summons may be served anyplace within the county in which the damage occurred, and shall be made returnable not less than 2 nor more than 6 days from the date stated in the summons and shall be served at least 2 days before the time of appearance mentioned in the summons. Upon the return day fixed in the summons the township supervisor or township officer or other person designated by the township board shall proceed to determine whether the loss or damage to the livestock was caused by the dog, and if so he or she shall immediately notify the sheriff or the animal control officer of the county of that fact and upon notification the sheriff or the animal control officer shall kill the dog wherever found. Any owner or keeper of the dog or dogs shall be liable to the county in a civil action for all damages and costs paid by the county on any claim as provided in this section.</DIV>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>287.334 Application for pet shop licenses; fee; deposit; filing of completed license application; "completed application" defined.</B><P>Sec. 4.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Applications for pet shop licenses must be on a form as provided or made available by the director. Beginning October 1, 2003 through September 30, 2012, the director shall issue pet shop licenses for a term of 1 year beginning January 1 of each year. After September 30, 2012, the director shall issue a pet shop license upon application and payment of a license fee of $150.00. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to subsection (6) and until September 30, 2012, the department shall charge a fee of $200.00 for an initial application for a pet shop license and a fee of $100.00 for renewal of a pet shop license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Until September 30, 2012 and except as otherwise provided for in this section, a pet shop license is renewable by submission of a completed renewal application provided or made available by the department and payment of the renewal fee described in subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The department shall deposit all license fees, inspection fees, other noncriminal fines or fees, and administrative fines received pursuant to this act into the agriculture licensing and inspection fees fund created in section 9 of the insect pest and plant disease act, 1931 PA 189, MCL 286.209, to be used, pursuant to appropriation, by the director in administering and carrying out those duties required by law under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Beginning July 23, 2004, the department shall issue an initial or renewal pet shop license not later than 90 days after the applicant files a completed application. Receipt of the application is considered the date the application is received by any agency or department of this state. If the application is considered incomplete by the department, the department shall notify the applicant in writing, or make the information electronically available, within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The 90-day period is tolled upon notification by the department of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the department. The determination of the completeness of an application is not an approval of the application for the license and does not confer eligibility of an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the department fails to issue or deny a license within the time required by this section, the department shall return the license fee and shall reduce the license fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. The failure to issue a license within the time required under this subsection does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and that application, upon completion, must be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based upon the fact that the license fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) As used in this section, "completed application" means an application complete on its face and submitted with any applicable licensing fees as well as any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of this state. In the case of an initial application, completed application includes the completion of construction or renovation of any facility and the passing of a satisfactory inspection.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 8a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, an animal control shelter or animal protection shelter shall not permit a person to adopt a dog, cat, or ferret that has not been altered, unless that person has entered into a contract for the alteration of the dog, cat, or ferret with the animal control shelter or animal protection shelter. The contract shall state that the adopting person agrees to have an alteration performed on the dog, cat, or ferret and shall otherwise comply with this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A contract with an animal control shelter or animal protection shelter entered into pursuant to subsection (1) shall require the adopting person to have an alteration performed on the dog, cat, or ferret within 4 weeks after the adoption date if at the time of adoption the dog, cat, or ferret is 6 months of age or older. If the dog, cat, or ferret to be adopted is under 6 months of age at the time of adoption, the contract shall contain the date upon which the dog, cat, or ferret will be 6 months of age, and shall require the person adopting the dog, cat, or ferret to have an alteration performed on the dog, cat, or ferret within 4 weeks after that date. This section does not prevent a veterinarian from performing an alteration on a dog, cat, or ferret that is under 6 months of age.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Upon certification by a veterinarian in writing that a dog, cat, or ferret has a serious, permanent medical or health problem that prevents an alteration, the dog, cat, or ferret adopted is not required to be altered. Upon certification by a veterinarian in writing that an alteration poses a serious, temporary medical or health problem, the alteration may be postponed. The person adopting the dog, cat, or ferret shall have it reevaluated by a veterinarian at intervals not to exceed 14 days and shall have the alteration performed no later than 7 days after a veterinarian determines that the temporary problem is resolved.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (7), a contract entered into pursuant to subsection (1) shall require the adopting person to leave with the animal control shelter or animal protection shelter, or a designee of the animal control shelter or animal protection shelter, a good faith deposit of at least $25.00 that indicates the person's intention to have the adopted dog, cat, or ferret altered within the time provided pursuant to subsection (2). If the person fails to comply with the terms of the contract, the deposit is forfeited. The good faith deposit shall be returned to the adopting person if the adopting person submits written certification from a veterinarian of either of the following: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The dog, cat, or ferret died within the time period in which the alteration was required under subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The dog, cat, or ferret has a serious, permanent medical or health problem that prevents an alteration.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Money forfeited under subsection (4) shall be used by the animal control shelter or animal protection shelter to finance alterations, for public education regarding the value of having dogs, cats, and ferrets altered, or to otherwise ensure compliance with this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If the adopting person complies with the terms of a contract entered into under subsection (1), the good faith deposit of at least $25.00 shall be refunded by the animal control shelter, animal protection shelter, or a designee of the animal control shelter or animal protection shelter, upon submission by the adopting person of written certification by a veterinarian that the adopted dog, cat, or ferret was altered. The certificate shall include the date of alteration, the name of the owner of the dog, cat, or ferret, the description of the dog, cat, or ferret, and the signature of the veterinarian who performed the alteration.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The good faith deposit under subsection (4) is not required if 1 or more of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A dog is transferred to a local, state, or federal law enforcement agency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A dog is transferred to an organization or trainer that trains guide or leader dogs for blind persons, hearing dogs for deaf or audibly impaired persons, or service dogs for physically limited persons.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A dog, cat, or ferret is transferred to another animal control shelter or animal protection shelter or is transferred to a person who will transfer the animal to another animal control shelter or animal protection shelter. Before the first animal control shelter or animal protection shelter releases the animal, it shall obtain from the person to whom the animal is to be released a written statement by the second animal control shelter or animal protection shelter that it is willing to accept the animal for purposes of adoption or humane euthanasia. Promptly after receipt of the animal by the second animal control shelter or animal protection shelter, the person to whom the animal was released shall provide the first animal control shelter or animal protection shelter with a written statement by the second animal control shelter or animal protection shelter containing a description of the dog, cat, or ferret and acknowledging its receipt on a date specified in the statement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   A contract entered into pursuant to subsection (1) shall include a statement that if the terms of the contract are breached because a person adopting a dog, cat, or ferret fails to have the animal altered as required in the contract, then the person agrees to pay liquidated damages of the greater of $100.00 or actual reasonable costs incurred by the animal control shelter or animal protection shelter to enforce the contract. Immediately before a person signs the contract, a representative of the animal control shelter or animal protection shelter shall verbally direct the person's attention to the liquidated damages agreement in the contract.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The following administrative orders may be issued by the director to enforce this act:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A cease order in compliance with this subdivision. When the director has probable cause to believe that a commercial feed operation is manufacturing or distributing adulterated or misbranded feed or fails to comply with this act or any of the rules promulgated under this act, the director may at any time order the responsible party to cease manufacturing or distributing commercial feed entirely or with limitations. The cease order may be either oral or written and shall inform the manufacturer, distributor, or other seller of the reason for the order. An oral cease order shall be followed by a written cease order as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Upon receipt of the cease order, the responsible party shall immediately comply with the order. Failure to comply subjects the responsible party to the penalties imposed under section 16.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The director shall rescind the cease order immediately upon being satisfied by inspection that the order has been complied with. An inspection may be conducted as soon as possible at the oral or written request of the responsible party. The rescission may be oral, and the responsible party may rely on the oral rescission. However, an oral rescission shall be followed by a written rescission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A seizure order in compliance with this subdivision. When necessary for the enforcement of this act, the director may seize without formal warrant any commercial feed being distributed in violation of this act or rules promulgated under this act as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The director may issue and enforce a written seizure order when the director finds or has probable cause to believe that commercial feed is unlicensed, adulterated, or misbranded, fails to meet guarantees, or is being distributed in violation of this act or rules promulgated under this act. When the director issues a seizure order, the distributor must hold the lot of commercial feed at the location where the seizure order was issued and not dispose of the lot of commercial feed in any manner until permission is given by the director.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The director shall release the lot of seized commercial feed when this act and the rules promulgated under this act have been complied with. If compliance is not obtained within 30 days, the director may, or, upon request of the licensee, shall, begin administrative proceedings for disposal or other use of the commercial feed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An embargo order in compliance with this subdivision. If the director finds or has probable cause to believe that any commercial feed is adulterated or misbranded or poses a threat to animal or human health, the director may issue an embargo order on the commercial feed product. A person shall not remove or dispose of the commercial feed that is subject to an embargo order until permission for removal or disposal is given by the director or a court of competent jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If proper processing or relabeling will correct a violation of this act, the commercial feed may be delivered to the licensee for processing or relabeling under the supervision of the director.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A licensee that is not in compliance with this act is responsible for all costs incurred in reprocessing or relabeling the commercial feed intended to correct the violation and is responsible for all costs involved in the transportation and disposal of any commercial feed not in compliance with this act. Disposal shall be in a manner consistent with the quality of the commercial feed and the laws of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A court shall not allow the recovery of damages by a person against whom an administrative action was brought resulting in an order requiring seizure or embargo of commercial feed if the court finds that there was probable cause for the action or order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the director finds any adulterated feed that the director declares to be a nuisance, the director shall immediately condemn, destroy, or in any other manner render the feed unsaleable as commercial feed. If adulterated or misbranded feed is a nuisance or is fraudulent and requires the director's supervision, or if the feed establishment requests the supervision of the director for sorting, destruction, reconditioning, or other disposition, the feed establishment that is in possession of the feed at the time of the seizure or embargo is liable for the costs of that supervision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If storage of seized commercial feed is not possible without risk to animal or human health, the director shall order immediate destruction of the feed to be accomplished without delay by the owner, operator, or person in charge of the feed establishment. The feed shall be destroyed as specified in the order for destruction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) As used in this section, "nuisance" means animal feed that is adulterated to the extent that it constitutes an impending danger to the health, safety, or welfare of humans or animals.</div>

This prohibition does not prohibit the director from exchanging information of a regulatory nature with appointed officials of the United States government, or of other states, who are similarly prohibited by law from revealing this information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The attorney general may file a civil action for a violation of this act.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) A disease herd plan in compliance with the operational standards incorporated by reference in subsection (1) to be approved by the state veterinarian under the animal industry act, 1988 PA 466, MCL 287.701 to 287.745.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Any other information considered necessary by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Upon receipt of an application, the director shall forward 1 copy each to the departments of agriculture and environmental quality. Upon receipt of an application, the department shall send a written notice to the local unit or units of government within which the proposed cervidae livestock facility will be located unless the department determines, from information provided in the application, that the local unit of government has a zoning ordinance under which the land is zoned agricultural. The local unit or units of government may respond, within 30 days of receipt of the written notice, indicating whether the applicant's cervidae livestock facility would be in violation of any ordinance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The department shall not issue an initial cervidae livestock facility registration or modification unless the application demonstrates all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The cervidae livestock facility has been inspected by the director and he or she has determined that the cervidae livestock facility meets the standards and requirements prescribed by and adopted under this act, complies with the business plan submitted to the department, and determines that there are barriers in place to prevent the escape of cervidae species and prevent the entry of wild cervidae species. A renewal or initial applicant must provide a perimeter fence in compliance with the operational standards incorporated by reference under subsection (1). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The method for individual animal identification complies with the standards incorporated by reference under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The applicant has all necessary permits that are required under part 31 regarding water resources protection, part 301 regarding inland lakes and streams, and part 303 regarding wetland protection of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.3101 to 324.3133, 324.30101 to 324.30113, and 324.30301 to 324.30323, and any other permits or authorizations that may be required by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Beginning the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection, the department shall issue an initial registration or modification registration allowing an expansion of an existing facility not later than 120 days after the applicant files a completed application. Renewal applications shall be issued not later than 60 days after the applicant files a completed application. Receipt of the application is considered the date the application is received by the department. If the application is considered incomplete by the department, the department shall notify the applicant in writing, or make the information electronically available, within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The determination of the completeness of an application does not operate as an approval of the application for the registration and does not confer eligibility upon an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a registration. The 120-day period is tolled under any of the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Notice sent by the department of a deficiency in the application until the date all of the requested information is received by the department. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The time period during which required actions are completed that include, but are not limited to, completion of construction or renovation of the facility; mandated reinspections if by the department; other inspections if required by any state, local, or federal agency; approval by the legislative body of a local unit of government; or other actions mandated by this act or as otherwise mandated by law or local ordinance. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the department fails to issue or deny a registration within the time required by this subsection, the department shall return the registration fee and shall reduce the registration fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. The failure to issue a registration within the time required under this section does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and that application, upon completion, shall be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based upon the fact that the registration fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Upon receipt of a denial under this section and without filing a second application, the applicant may request in writing and, if requested, the department shall provide an informal review of the application. The review shall include the applicant, the department, and the departments of agriculture and environmental quality, if applicable. After the informal review, if the director determines that the proposed cervidae livestock facility or cervidae livestock operation complies with the requirements of this act, the director shall issue a registration within 30 days after the applicant notifies the department of completion of the facility. After the informal review, if the director determines that the proposed cervidae livestock facility or cervidae livestock operation does not comply with the requirements of this act, the director shall affirm the denial of the application in writing and specify the deficiencies needed to be addressed or corrected in order for a registration to be issued. The applicant may waive the informal review of the application.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this subsection, "completed application" means an application complete on its face and submitted with any applicable registration fees as well as any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of the state of Michigan.</div>

</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, Section 1 of Article V of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 vests the executive power of the State of Michigan in the Governor;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, Section 2 of Article V of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 empowers the Governor to make changes in the organization of the Executive Branch or in the assignment of functions among its units that the Governor considers necessary for efficient administration;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, facilities and operations for captive cervidae including deer, elk, moose, and reindeer, can have serious impacts on the state's wildlife population and the agricultural industry;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, unlike domestic livestock species, when deer and elk escape from privately-owned cervidae livestock facilities and operations, they are indistinguishable from free-ranging deer and elk, and also pose a potential risk to native animals, such as the transmission of parasites and disease;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, deer and other cervidae are migratory animals often moving substantial distances seasonally, magnifying potential impacts on Michigan's wildlife population;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, Chronic Wasting Disease is an incurable neurological disease of deer and elk that can be spread directly from animal to animal, or indirectly from soil or surface to animal;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, Chronic Wasting Disease was once considered to be a disease limited to small endemic areas of Western United States, but has recently been discovered in more than 15 states and in Canada.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, while the disease has the potential to devastate Michigan's deer and elk population, with state action, and the cooperation of private industry, Michigan can work to prevent Chronic Wasting Disease and other potential problems to maintain a healthy and safe future for Michigan wildlife;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, it is imperative that Michigan remain vigilant and act decisively in adopting measures to protect native deer and elk from Chronic Wasting Disease and reduce vulnerabilities to the spread of the disease;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, in light of the potential impact on Michigan's wildlife population, the Governor's Chronic Wasting Disease Task Force, chaired by Dr. Howard Tanner, has recommended that the licensing, application, registration, and inspection functions for privately-owned cervidae livestock facilities and operations be transferred to the Department of Natural Resources;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, the Governor's Chronic Wasting Disease Task Force has also recommended a complete audit of Michigan's privately-owned cervidae livestock facilities and operations, which under current budgetary conditions can most effectively be performed by the Department of Natural Resources;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, it is necessary in the interests of efficient administration and effectiveness of government to effect changes in the organization of the executive branch of state government;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>NOW THEREFORE, I, Jennifer M. Granholm, Governor of the State of Michigan, by virtue of the power and authority vested in me by the Michigan Constitution of 1963 and Michigan law, order the following: </div>

For the purposes of this subsection, an individual is lawfully on the private property of the owner or person temporarily in possession of the wolf-dog cross if the individual is on that property in the performance of any duty imposed upon him or her by the laws of this state or by the laws or postal regulations of the United States, or if the individual is on that property as an invitee or licensee of the person lawfully in possession of the property, unless the individual has gained lawful entry upon the property for the purpose of an unlawful or criminal act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a wolf-dog cross escapes or is released, intentionally or unintentionally, the owner or person temporarily in possession of the wolf-dog cross shall immediately contact a law enforcement officer of the local unit where the escape or release occurred to report the loss, escape, or release. The owner or person temporarily in possession of the wolf-dog cross is liable for all expenses associated with efforts to recapture the wolf-dog cross that is released or escapes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The owner or person temporarily in possession of the wolf-dog cross may bring against a person who is responsible in whole or part for the escape or release of the wolf-dog cross a civil action for damages, including, but not limited to, damages and expenses under subsection (1), (2), or (3).</DIV>
