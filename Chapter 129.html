<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The Michigan tobacco settlement finance authority is created as a public body corporate and politic within the department of treasury. The authority is a state institution within the meaning of section 9 of article II of the state constitution of 1963 and an instrumentality of this state exercising public and essential governmental functions. The exercise by the authority of the powers conferred by this act is an essential governmental function of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Notwithstanding the existence of common management, the authority shall be treated and accounted for as a separate legal entity with its separate corporate purposes as set forth in this act. The assets, liabilities, and funds of the authority shall not be consolidated or commingled with those of this state or of any entity capable of being a debtor in a case commenced under the federal bankruptcy code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The authority shall have power and is hereby authorized from time to time to issue bonds in the principal amount or amounts and with the maturities as the authority shall determine to be necessary to provide sufficient funds for achieving its authorized purposes, consisting of the purchase of all or a portion of the state's tobacco receipts under this act and the payment of or provision for financing costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The board of the authority shall authorize the issuance of bonds by resolution. The authority may issue bonds, including refunding bonds, without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau, or agency of this state and without any other proceedings or the occurrence of any other conditions other than those proceedings, conditions, or things that are specifically required by this act. Every issue of bonds shall be special revenue obligations payable from and secured by a pledge of encumbered tobacco revenues and other assets, including without limitation the proceeds of the bonds deposited in a reserve fund for the benefit of the owners of the bonds, earnings on funds of the authority and other funds as may become available, upon the terms and conditions as specified by the authority in the authority resolution under which the bonds are issued or in a related trust agreement or trust indenture.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The authority may issue bonds to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whenever it considers the refunding expedient, whether the bonds to be refunded have or have not matured, and to issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for restructuring or any of its other authorized purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For each issue of bonds, the authority shall determine all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The date of issuance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Whether the bonds shall bear no interest, appreciate as to principal amount, bear interest at fixed or variable rates, or any combination of these.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Whether the bonds shall be payable at or prior to maturity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) When the bonds shall mature.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Whether the authority may redeem the bonds prior to maturity, at what price, and under what conditions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The method of payment of principal of and interest on the bonds.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The form, denominations, and places of payment of principal of and interest on the bonds.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) If any officer whose signature or the facsimile of whose signature appears on any bond shall cease to be that officer before the delivery of the bond, that signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if he or she had remained in office until delivery of the bond.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Any other terms and conditions necessary to issue the bonds in fully marketable form.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The authority may sell the bonds in the manner determined by the authority board, at public or private sale, and on either a competitive or negotiated basis. The authority shall disburse the net proceeds of the bonds to the state treasurer as provided in section 8. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) This act shall govern the creation, perfection, priority, and enforcement of any pledge of revenues or other security made by the authority. Each pledge made by the authority shall be valid and binding at the time the pledge is made. The encumbered tobacco revenues, reserves, or earnings pledged or earnings on the investment of the encumbered tobacco revenues, reserves, or earnings pledged shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery or further act and the lien on that pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the authority, irrespective of whether the parties have notice of the lien or pledge, and without filing or recording the pledge. The resolution or other instrument by which a pledge is created does not have to be recorded.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) This act shall also govern the negotiability of bonds issued under this act. Any bonds issued under this act shall be fully negotiable within the meaning and for all purposes of the uniform commercial code. By accepting the bond or obligation, each owner of a bond or other obligation of the authority shall be conclusively considered to have agreed that the bond is and shall be fully negotiable within the meaning and for all purposes of the uniform commercial code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) In the discretion of the authority, any bonds and any ancillary facilities may be secured by a trust agreement or trust indenture by and between the authority and a trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company, whether located within or without this state. A trust agreement or trust indenture authorized under this subsection, or an authority resolution providing for the issuance of bonds may provide for the creation and maintenance of reserves as the authority shall determine to be proper and may include covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the bonds, the ancillary facilities, the income to the authority, the sale agreement, the encumbered tobacco revenues and residual interests. A trust agreement or trust indenture authorized under this subsection or an authority resolution may contain provisions respecting the custody, safeguarding, and application of all money and bonds and may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies under the sale agreement of the owners of the bonds and benefited parties as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state that may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of any other funds or obligations received on behalf of the authority to furnish indemnifying bonds or to pledge obligations as may be required by the authority. Any trust agreement or trust indenture authorized under this subsection or an authority resolution may contain other provisions as the authority may consider reasonable and proper for priorities and subordination among the owners of bonds and benefited parties.</div>

The authority may also purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person against the liability asserted against the person and incurred by the person in any capacity or arising out of the status of the person as a member of the board or an officer or employee of the authority, whether or not the authority would have the power to indemnify the person against that liability under this subsection. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) A member, officer, employee or agent of the authority shall not have an interest, either directly or indirectly, in any business organization engaged in any business, contract or transaction with the authority or in any contract of any other person engaged in any business with the authority, or in the purchase, sale, lease or transfer of any property to or from the authority.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The state budget director with the approval of the state administrative board may sell to the authority, and the authority may purchase, for cash or other consideration and in 1 or more installments, all or a portion of the state's tobacco receipts pursuant to the terms of 1 or more sale agreements. In the alternative, the state budget director with the approval of the state administrative board may sell all or a portion of the state's tobacco receipts for cash or other consideration to a person or persons other than the authority, if the terms of the sale agreement to sell the state's tobacco receipts are in the best interests of this state and the net proceeds of the sale will not exceed $400,000,000.00. If the sale to a person or persons other than the authority is in the best interests of this state, the state administrative board shall approve the terms of the sale agreement. The sale agreement or combined sale agreements shall provide for the sale of that portion of the state’s tobacco receipts sufficient to provide net proceeds to the state in the amount of $815,000,000.00, of which $400,000,000.00 shall be deposited to and held, used, and expended by the state treasurer in the manner provided for in the Michigan trust fund act, 2000 PA 489, MCL 12.251 to 12.260, $207,800,000.00 shall be deposited in the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963, and the balance shall be deposited in the general fund. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A sale agreement or combined sale agreements under this section may also provide for refunding, refinancing, and the sale by this state of residual interests sufficient to provide net proceeds to the state in the amount of $60,000,000.00. Any net proceeds resulting from a refunding or refinancing of bonds issued under this act prior to the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection or the sale of residual interests existing on or after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection shall be deposited in the general fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Any sale agreement shall provide that the purchase price payable by the authority to the state for TSRs shall consist of the net proceeds and the residual interests, if any. In addition, any sale shall be pursuant to 1 or more sale agreements that may contain the terms and conditions considered appropriate by the state budget director to carry out and effectuate the purposes of this section, including without limitation covenants binding this state in favor of the authority and its assignees, including without limitation the owners of the bonds and benefited parties, including a requirement that the state enforce the provisions of the master settlement agreement that require the payment of the TSRs, a requirement that the state enforce the provisions of the qualifying statute, a provision authorizing inclusion of the state's pledge and agreement, as set forth in section 11, in any agreement with owners of the bonds or any benefited parties, and covenants with respect to the application and use of the proceeds of the sale of the state's tobacco receipts to preserve the tax exemption of the interest on any bonds, if issued as tax-exempt. The state budget director in any sale agreement may agree to, and the authority may provide for, the assignment of the authority's right, title, and interest under the sale agreement for the benefit and security of the owners of bonds and benefited parties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A sale agreement may provide that the remedies available to the authority and the bondholders for any breach of the pledges and agreements of this state set forth in subsection (3) shall be limited to injunctive relief and that this state shall be considered to have diligently enforced the qualifying statute if there has been no judicial determination by a court of competent jurisdiction in this state, in an action commenced by a participating tobacco manufacturer under the master settlement agreement, that this state has failed to diligently enforce the qualifying statute.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The approval of the state administrative board shall be made by a resolution adopted by the state administrative board and that approval together with the sale agreement made pursuant to that approval shall be conclusively presumed to be valid for all purposes unless challenged in an action brought in the court of appeals within 30 days after the adoption of the resolution. All challenges shall be heard and determined as expeditiously as possible with lawful precedence over other matters. Consideration by the court of appeals shall be based solely on the record before the state administrative board and briefs to the court shall be limited to whether the resolution conforms to the constitution and laws of this state and the United States and is within the authority of the state administrative board under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A sale of all or a portion of the state’s tobacco receipts to the authority under a sale agreement shall be treated as a true sale and absolute transfer of the state’s tobacco receipts transferred and not as a pledge or other security interest for any borrowing. A sale agreement that expressly states that the transfer of all or a portion of the state’s tobacco receipts to the authority is a sale or other absolute transfer signifies that the transaction is a true sale and is not a secured transaction and that title, legal and equitable, has passed to the authority. The characterization of a sale as an absolute transfer by the participants shall not be negated or adversely affected by the fact that only a portion of the state's tobacco receipts are transferred, or by the acquisition or retention by this state of a residual interest, or by the participation by any state official as a member or officer of the authority, or by whether the state is responsible for collecting the TSRs or otherwise enforcing the master settlement agreement or retains legal title to the portion of the state's tobacco receipts for the purposes of these collection activities, or by any characterization of the authority or its obligations for purposes of accounting, taxation, or securities regulation, or by any other factor whatsoever. A true sale under this act exists regardless of whether the authority has any recourse against this state, or any other term of the sale agreement, including the fact that this state acts as a collector of the state's tobacco receipts or the treatment of the transfer as a financing for any purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) On and after the effective date of each sale of TSRs, the state shall have no right, title, or interest in or to the TSRs sold, and the TSRs sold shall be property of the authority and not of this state, and shall be owned, received, held, and disbursed by the authority and not this state. On or before the effective date of a sale described in this subsection, this state through the state treasurer shall notify the escrow agent under the master settlement agreement that this state has sold all or a portion of the state’s tobacco receipts to the authority, including, if applicable, a statement as to the percentage sold and shall irrevocably instruct the escrow agent that, subsequent to the date specified in the notice, that portion of the state’s tobacco receipts are to be paid directly to the authority or the trustee under the applicable authority resolution, trust agreement, or trust indenture for the benefit of the owners of the bonds and benefited parties until the authority’s bonds and ancillary facilities are no longer outstanding. Once the bonds or ancillary facilities are no longer outstanding, an officer or agent of this state who shall receive any TSRs shall hold them in trust for the authority or the trustee, as applicable, and shall promptly remit the same to the authority or the trustee, as applicable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The net proceeds and any earnings on the net proceeds shall never be pledged to, or made available for, payment of the bonds or ancillary facilities or any interest or redemption price or any other debt or obligation of the authority.</div>

Any recipient of the proceeds of bonds bearing interest that is intended to be exempt from federal income tax, including without limitation this state or any political subdivision of this state, is authorized to execute a tax regulatory agreement with the authority and, as to any political subdivision that is a recipient of the proceeds of bonds bearing interest that is intended to be exempt from federal income, this state.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) At the end of the 90-day period or by the first meeting of the fiduciary following the 90-day period described in section 3, the fiduciary shall assemble all scrutinized companies identified into a scrutinized companies list.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The fiduciary shall update the scrutinized companies list described in subsection (1) on a quarterly basis based on evolving information from, among other sources, those sources listed in section 3. However, if a fiduciary receives credible information that shows that a scrutinized company was wrongfully identified as a scrutinized company, the fiduciary shall immediately modify the scrutinized company list to remove the name of the scrutinized company.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The fiduciary shall adhere to the following procedure for companies on the scrutinized companies list described in subsection (1):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The fiduciary shall immediately determine the companies on the scrutinized companies list in which the fiduciary oversees pursuant to its responsibilities as described in section 2(e).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For each company identified in subdivision (a) with only inactive business operations, the fiduciary shall send a written notice informing the company of this section and encourage the company to continue to refrain from initiating active business operations in a state sponsor of terror until it is able to avoid scrutinized business operations and further encourage the company to engage in substantial humanitarian operations in the country. The fiduciary shall continue the correspondence on a semiannual basis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For each company newly identified in subdivision (a) with active business operations, the fiduciary shall send a written notice informing the company of its scrutinized company status and that it may become subject to divestment by the fiduciary. The notice shall offer the company the opportunity to clarify its state sponsor of terror-related activities and shall encourage the company, within 90 days, to either cease its scrutinized business operations or convert such operations to inactive business operations in order to avoid qualifying for divestment by the fiduciary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If, within 90 days following the fiduciary's first engagement with a company, that company ceases scrutinized business operations, the company shall be removed from the scrutinized companies list and this act shall cease to apply to it unless it resumes scrutinized business operations. If, within 9 months following the fiduciary's first engagement, the company converts its scrutinized active business operations to inactive business operations, the company shall not be subject to this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If, after 90 days following the fiduciary's first engagement with a company, if the company has not developed and announced a plan to convert its active business operations to inactive business operations, and only while the company continues to have scrutinized active business operations, the fiduciary shall sell, redeem, divest, or withdraw all publicly traded securities of the company, according to the following schedule:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) At least 50% of the assets shall be removed from the fiduciary's assets under management within 9 months after the company's most recent appearance on the scrutinized companies list.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) 100% of the assets shall be removed from the fiduciary's assets under management within 15 months after the company's most recent appearance on the scrutinized companies list.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Except as provided in subdivision (g), at no time shall the fiduciary acquire securities of companies on the scrutinized companies list that have active business operations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Subdivisions (e) and (f) shall not apply to indirect holdings in actively managed investment funds. For purposes of this section, actively managed investment funds include private equity funds and publicly traded funds. Before the fiduciary invests in a new private equity fund that is not in the fiduciary's portfolio as of the effective date of this act, the fiduciary shall perform due diligence to prevent investment in any private equity fund in violation of this act. The fiduciary is not required to identify holdings in private equity funds or submit engagement letters to those funds. If the manager of a publicly traded, actively managed fund that is in the fiduciary's portfolio on the effective date of this act creates a similar publicly traded, actively managed fund with indirect holdings devoid of identified scrutinized companies with scrutinized active business operations as defined in this act, the fiduciary is not required to, but is strongly encouraged to, replace all applicable investments with investments in the similar fund in an expedited time frame consistent with prudent investment standards.</div>
