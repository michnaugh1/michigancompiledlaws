<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   June 14 through July 14 each year is designated as the official flag month of this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Handling and displaying the flag of the United States is encouraged according to the following guidelines:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The flag of the United States should be at the center and at the highest point of the group when a number of flags of states or localities or pennants of societies are grouped and displayed from staffs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   When flags of states, cities, or localities, or pennants of societies are flown on the same halyard with the flag of the United States, the flag of the United States should always be at the peak. When the flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the flag of the United States should be hoisted first and lowered last. No other flag or pennant should be placed above the flag of the United States or to the United States flag's right.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   When flags of 2 or more nations are displayed, they should be flown from separate staffs of the same height. The flags should be of approximately equal size. A flag of 1 nation should not be placed above the flag of another nation in time of peace.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   When the flag of the United States is displayed from a staff projecting horizontally or at an angle from the windowsill, balcony, or front of a building, the union of the flag should be placed at the peak of the staff. The flag should be hoisted out, union first, from the building.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   When the flag of the United States is displayed either horizontally or vertically, the union should be uppermost and to the flag's own right and should be to the observer's left. When displayed in a window, the flag of the United States should be displayed in the same way, with the union or blue field to the left of the observer in the street.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   When the flag is displayed over the middle of the street, it should be suspended vertically with the union to the north in an east and west street and to the east in a north and south street. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   When used on a speaker's platform, the flag, if displayed flat, should be displayed above and behind the speaker.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   When displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium, the flag of the United States should be at the clergyman's or speaker's right as he or she faces the audience. Any other flag displayed should be placed on the left of the clergyman or speaker or to the right of the audience. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The flag of the United States should form a distinctive feature of the ceremony of unveiling a public statue or monument, but the flag should not be used as the covering for the public statue or monument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)   The flag of the United States, when flown at half-staff, should be first hoisted to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff position. The flag should be raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Be it resolved by the senate and house of representatives of the state of Michigan, that </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whereas, The eighty-first general assembly of Ohio in house bill 701 passed May twenty-seventh, 1915, and the forty-eighth Legislature of Michigan by Act 84 of Public Acts of 1915, provided for a joint re-location and permanent monumenting of the line between Ohio and Michigan, and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whereas, This work has been duly executed by the proper officers of both states as evidenced by their report dated July first, 1916, to the governing authorities of both states, therefore be it</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Resolved, That the said boundary line as re-located and monumented under authority of the acts above cited be adopted as the true boundary, and that the work of the commissioners and their above mentioned report be adopted as final.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whereas, Uncertainty has existed concerning the boundary between the states of Ohio and Michigan in Lake Erie, due to the omission of this portion of the boundary on some maps and its incorrect position on others; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whereas, The easterly terminal monument of the Ohio-Michigan land-boundary line set in 1817 by Andrew Harris has disappeared, due to the washing away of North Cape at the place where the monument originally stood; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whereas, The earliest United States lake survey charts of the region show that the aforesaid terminal monument was at or near the intersection of the land-line between the two states and a line drawn south forty-five degrees west (S 45° W) through the center of Turtle island which is located at latitude 41° 45' 08.8" and longitude 83° 23' 28.8" according to primary triangulation of the United States lake survey published in 1882; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whereas, The center part of the island was preserved by a circular concrete sea wall about 190 feet in diameter by the U.S. lighthouse service, which wall is still standing; now therefore be it</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That the boundary line between the states of Ohio and Michigan in Lake Erie shall be a line passing through the center of the aforesaid circular wall and bearing south forty-five degrees west (S 45° W) therefrom until it shall intersect the land-line between the two states as marked and monumented by them in 1915; and that from the aforesaid center of the circular wall the boundary in Lake Erie shall extend north forty-five degrees east (N 45° E) until it shall intersect the international boundary between the United States and Canada, it being understood that all bearings herein referred to shall be measured from a true meridian through the center of the aforesaid circular wall on Turtle island. </DIV>

<P>
</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whereas, In the 1945 regular session of the legislature of Michigan adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 15 relative to the boundary line between the two states of Ohio and Michigan in Lake Erie; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whereas, Said concurrent resolution was presented to the legislature as a part of a proposal to determine the area of the entire state by inclusion of water areas within the total and without any other significance; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whereas, Upon subsequent investigation it became apparent that an area of about 70 square miles in Lake Erie was involved in the matter then presented and some question as to the jurisdiction over said water existed between the state of Ohio and the state of Michigan; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whereas, The particular area in question became a matter of dispute because of early surveys and maps purporting to determine the boundary line between the states in Lake Erie and showing for a great many years that the said boundary ran from a terminus in Lake Erie from a non-existent boundary marker, which was formerly Grassy Point, to a turning point in the international boundary line between the United States and Canada, said line being at an angle more acute than 45 degrees; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whereas, The state of Ohio, by a concurrent resolution adopted several years ago attempted to resolve the stated uncertainty concerning the boundary line by adopting a point on Turtle Island in Lake Erie as a basis for a line at 45° to intersect the land boundary line between the states and to intersect the International boundary line thereby conforming more closely to the language of the original and enabling acts and the constitutional provisions regarding the boundary line between the two states; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whereas, It is apparent that for many years the state of Michigan has exercised jurisdiction over the area in question and may have established by adverse possession and by consent and acquiescence of the state of Ohio a good title thereto; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whereas, Since the action of the two legislatures by concurrent resolution is not sufficient in the law governing the relationship of States to convey title or change boundary lines, no settlement of any such dispute can be reached by such method; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whereas, If a settlement is to be reached it will, of necessity, require statutory enactment by the two states and should be the subject matter of an investigation by a joint boundary commission; now therefore be it</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That the State of Michigan nor any rights of said state concerning the boundary line in Lake Erie between the state of Ohio and the state of Michigan were not affected by the adoption of Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 15 of the 1945 session of the Michigan legislature; and be it further</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Resolved, That insofar as said concurrent resolution No. 15 may in any manner be interpreted as determinative of the position of the state of Michigan with regard to the said boundary in Lake Erie, said concurrent resolution is hereby rescinded; and be it further</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Resolved, That the Governor of the state of Michigan is hereby requested to confer with the Governor of the state of Ohio concerning the subject matter hereof with a view to requesting the legislatures to establish a boundary commission to investigate and to report to the legislatures the rights of the respective states within Lake Erie; and be it further</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Resolved, That a copy of this concurrent resolution be sent to the Governor of this state.</DIV>
