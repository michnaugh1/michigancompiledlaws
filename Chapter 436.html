If an appellate court declares this amendatory act unconstitutional, then it is the intent of the legislature that a good faith effort be made to amend section 305 of the Michigan liquor control code of 1998, 1998 PA 58, MCL 436.1305, to make it less burdensome for a small winery to terminate an agreement with a wholesaler."</p>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The legislature finds that the 3-tier system is necessary to protect public health and safety of Michigan residents and to promote competition and access to market for all alcoholic beverage suppliers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The legislature further finds that vertical integration of the alcoholic beverage industry is contrary to this state's interest in protecting public health and safety of Michigan residents and leads to anti-competitive behavior by beverage alcohol suppliers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The legislature further finds that the 3-tier system and the prohibitions under section 603 achieve the following public policy goals:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Promote consumer choice and product variety by providing a platform that provides all suppliers access to Michigan's beverage alcohol market.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Encourage wholesalers to invest in their businesses and all the brands they distribute, free from undue interference from the suppliers of the brands they distribute.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The commission shall, as provided in section 203(1), by order appoint authorized distribution agents to warehouse and deliver spirits in this state to ensure that all retail licensees are properly serviced with spirits. An authorized distribution agent is subject to uniform requirements, including business operating procedures, that the commission may prescribe by rule, subject to this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A person is eligible for appointment by the commission as an authorized distribution agent if all of the following circumstances exist:</div>

A supplier of spirits or a retailer shall not have a direct or indirect interest in an authorized distribution agent. An authorized distribution agent shall not hold title to spirits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An authorized distribution agent shall deliver to each retailer located in its assigned distribution area on at least a weekly basis if the order meets the minimum requirements. Except that in a week that accompanies a state holiday, the commission may order a modified delivery schedule if a retailer will not wait longer than 9 days between deliveries because of the modified delivery schedule. The commission shall provide for an integrated online ordering system for spirits and shall require the continuance of any ordering system in existence on the activation date of the system established under section 206. The commission shall set minimum requirements that must be a sufficient number of bottles to comprise not more than 2 cases. A retailer may pick up the product at the authorized distribution agent's warehouse. To avoid occasional emergency outages of spirits, a retail licensee may make up to 12 special emergency orders to an authorized distribution agent in each calendar year. An authorized distribution agent shall make a special emergency order available to the retail licensee within 18 hours of the placing of the order. An authorized distribution agent shall make a special emergency order placed on Saturday or Sunday available to the retail licensee before noon on the following Monday. An authorized distribution agent may impose a fee of up to $20.00 to deliver a special emergency order to a retail licensee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) In locations inaccessible to a motor vehicle as that term is defined by section 33 of the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.33, an authorized distribution agent shall arrange that a delivery of spirits to a retailer be in compliance with the following procedures:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) After processing an order from a retailer, an authorized distribution agent shall contact a retailer to confirm the quantity of cases or bottles, or both, and the exact dollar total of the order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The authorized distribution agent shall coordinate with the retailer the date and time a driver is scheduled to deliver the order to a ferry transport dock, shall arrange any ferry, drayage, or other appropriate service, and shall pick up the retailer's payment at that time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The ferry transport company or company representing any other form of conveyance shall take the retailer's payment to the mainland dock and give that payment to the authorized distribution agent's driver.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The ferry transport company or company representing any other form of conveyance shall transport the order to the drayage or other appropriate company at the island dock for immediate delivery to the retailer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The drayage or other appropriate company shall deliver the order to the retailer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An authorized distribution agent is responsible for the payment of all transportation and delivery charges imposed by the ferry, drayage, or other conveyance company and is responsible for all breakage and any shortages, whether attributable to the ferry, drayage, or other conveyance company or any combination of those companies, until the order is delivered to the retailer's establishment. This subsection does not prevent the authorized distribution agent from seeking reimbursement or damages from any company conveying the authorized distribution agent's product.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4), an authorized distribution agent shall not charge a delivery fee or a split-case fee for delivery of spirits sold by the commission to a retailer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) An authorized distribution agent or prospective authorized distribution agent shall maintain and make available to the commission or its representatives, on notice, any contract or written agreement it has with a supplier of spirits or other authorized distribution agent for the warehousing and delivering of spirits in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) For a violation of this act, a rule promulgated under this act, or the terms of an order appointing an authorized distribution agent, an authorized distribution agent is subject to the suspension, revocation, forfeiture, and penalty provisions of sections 903(1) and 907 in the same manner in which a licensee would be subject to those provisions. An authorized distribution agent aggrieved by a penalty imposed by the commission may invoke the hearing and appeal procedures of section 903(2) and rules promulgated under section 903.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A specially designated distributor may sell to an on-premises retailer up to 120 liters of spirits during any calendar year and an on-premises retailer may purchase, collectively from specially designated distributors, up to 120 liters of spirits during any calendar year. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act or rule promulgated under this act, a specially designated distributor is only liable for knowingly violating this section. An on-premises retailer shall maintain and make available to the commission on request records verifying the purchases described in this subsection. For each month in which an on-premises retailer purchases spirits under this subsection, the on-premises retailer shall submit a report to the commission indicating the purchases the on-premises retailer made under this subsection during that month. By July 1, 2020, the commission shall establish the method and form for the electronic reporting of purchases made under this subsection by on-premises retailers. The commission shall not require an on-premises retailer to submit a report under this subsection in less than monthly intervals and shall not require a report from an on-premises retailer in a month in which the on-premises retailer did not purchase spirits under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) In addition to paying a vendor of spirits the acquisition price for purchasing spirits, the commission may pay a vendor of spirits an additional amount of not less than $8.25 and not more than $12.50 for each case of spirits purchased as an offset to the costs being incurred by that vendor of spirits in contracting with an authorized distribution agent for warehousing and delivering spirits to retailers. The payment described in this subsection may not be included in the cost of purchasing spirits by the commission and is not subject to the commission's markup, special taxes, or state sales tax. The per-case offset established by this subsection may be increased by the state administrative board each January to reflect reasonable increases in the authorized distribution agent's cost of warehousing and delivering. As used in this subsection, "case" means a container holding twelve 750 ml bottles of spirits or other containers containing spirits that are standard to the industry.</div>

The supplier shall repurchase the ineligible product from the wholesaler when the ineligibility is caused by the supplier. The supplier must give the wholesaler written notice specifying the ineligible product.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Notwithstanding subsections (7), (10), (11), and (12), a supplier may terminate, cancel, not renew, or discontinue an agreement upon not less than 30 days' prior written notice if the supplier discontinues production or discontinues distribution in this state of all the brands sold by the supplier to the wholesaler. Nothing in this section prohibits a supplier upon not less than 30 days' notice to discontinue the distribution of any particular brand or package of wine or mixed spirit drink. This subsection does not prohibit a supplier from conducting test marketing of a new brand of wine or mixed spirit drink or from conducting the test marketing of a brand of wine or mixed spirit drink that is not currently being sold in this state if the supplier has notified the commission in writing of its plans to test market. The notice must describe the market area in which the test must be conducted; the name or names of the wholesaler or wholesalers who will be selling the wine or mixed spirit drink; the name or names of the brand of wine or mixed spirit drink being tested; and the period of time during which the testing will take place.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) A supplier shall not withhold consent to any transfer of a wholesaler's business if the proposed transferee meets the material and reasonable qualifications and standards required by the supplier. A wholesaler shall give the supplier written notice of intent to transfer the wholesaler's business. A supplier shall not unreasonably delay a response to a request for a proposed transfer of a wholesaler's business. However, a transfer of a wholesaler's business that is not approved by the supplier is void. A supplier shall not interfere with, or prevent, the transfer of the wholesaler's business if the proposed transferee is a designated member.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) A supplier as part of the written agreement required by this section may, subject to the provisions of subsection (3)(l), require a wholesaler to designate a successor manager who shall be subject to prior approval by the supplier. If the designated successor manager fails to assume the role of approved manager or for any reason does not continue to manage the wholesaler's business, after assuming that responsibility, then any successor shall be subject to the prior approval of the supplier, subject to the provisions of subsection (3)(l), notwithstanding the transferee's interest as a designated member.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) A supplier that has amended, canceled, terminated, or refused to renew any agreement; has caused a wholesaler to resign from an agreement; or has withheld consent to any assignment or transfer of a wholesaler's business, except as provided for in this section, shall pay the wholesaler reasonable compensation for the diminished value of the wholesaler's business or of any ancillary business which has been negatively affected by the act of the supplier, or both. The value of the wholesaler's business or ancillary business must include, but not be limited to, its goodwill.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) A supplier or wholesaler may, at any time, determine that mutual agreement on the amount of reasonable compensation cannot be reached. If such a determination is made, the supplier or the wholesaler shall send written notice to the other party declaring their intention to proceed with arbitration. Arbitration may proceed only by mutual agreement of both parties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) The supplier and wholesaler may, by agreement, submit the matter of determining the amount of compensation under arbitration to a 5-member arbitration panel consisting of 2 representatives selected by the supplier but unassociated with the affected supplier, 2 wholesaler representatives selected by the wholesaler but unassociated with the wholesaler, and an impartial arbitrator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) Not more than 10 days after the notice to enter into arbitration has been sent, the supplier and wholesaler shall request, in writing, a list of 5 arbitrators from the American arbitration association. Not more than 10 days after the supplier and wholesaler receive of the list of 5 choices, the wholesaler arbitrators and the supplier arbitrators may strike and disqualify up to 2 names each from the list. If the supplier or wholesaler fails to respond within the 10 days or if more than 1 name remains, the American arbitration association shall select the impartial arbitrator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) Not more than 30 days after the supplier and wholesaler receive the list of arbitrators, the wholesaler and supplier shall exchange in writing the names of their respective arbitration panel representatives.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) Not more than 30 days after the final selection of the arbitration panel is made, the arbitration panel shall convene to decide the dispute. The panel shall render a decision by majority vote of the participants within 20 days after the arbitration concludes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(23) The cost of the impartial arbitrator, the stenographer, and the meeting site must be equally divided between the wholesaler and the supplier. All other costs must be paid by the party incurring them. The award of the arbitration panel is final and binding on the parties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(24) If the supplier or wholesaler fails to abide by the time limitations as prescribed in subsections (20), (21), and (22), or fails or refuses to select any arbitrators, or fails to participate in the arbitration hearings, the other party shall make the selection of their arbitrators and proceed to arbitration. The party who has failed or refused to comply as prescribed in this subsection is considered to be in default. Any party considered to be in default under this subsection waives any rights the party would have had in the arbitration and is considered to have consented to the determination of the arbitration panel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(25) A wholesaler shall not waive any of the rights granted in this section. This section does not limit or prohibit a good faith dispute settlement voluntarily entered into by the parties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(26) A successor to a supplier that continues in business as a wine maker, mixed spirit drink manufacturer, an outstate seller of wine, outstate seller of mixed spirit drink, or master distributor is bound by all terms and conditions of each agreement of the supplier with a wholesaler licensed in this state that were in effect on the date on which the successor received the distribution rights of the previous supplier.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(27) This section applies to agreements in existence on June 26, 1984, as well as agreements entered into or renewed after that date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(28) If a supplier engages in conduct prohibited under this section, a wholesaler with which the supplier has an agreement may maintain a civil action against the supplier to recover actual damages reasonably incurred as the result of the prohibited conduct. If a wholesaler engages in conduct prohibited under this section, a supplier with which the wholesaler has an agreement may maintain a civil action against the wholesaler to recover actual damages reasonably incurred as the result of the prohibited conduct.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(29) A supplier that violates this section is liable for all actual damages and all court costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by a wholesaler as a result of that violation. A wholesaler that violates this section is liable for all actual damages and all court costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the supplier as a result of that violation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(30) A supplier or wholesaler may bring an action for declaratory judgment for determination of any controversy arising under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(31) Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a court finds that a supplier has not acted in good faith in amending, terminating, canceling, or not renewing any agreement; or has unreasonably withheld its consent to any assignment, transfer, or sale of a wholesaler's business, the court may award exemplary damages, as well as actual damages, court costs, and reasonable attorney fees to the wholesaler that has been damaged by the action of the supplier.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(32) On proper application to a court, a supplier or wholesaler may obtain injunctive relief against any violation of this section. If the court grants injunctive relief or issues a temporary restraining order, bond is not required to be posted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(33) The procedure for resolving any violation of subsection (3)(a), (b), (c), (e), (f), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), or (4) is the procedure prescribed by this act and the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328. Any other violation of or dispute regarding this section, unless the dispute is resolved pursuant to subsections (18) to (24), must only be resolved by a civil action in court as provided in this section and not by the commission.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   There was fraudulent conduct on the part of the wholesaler in dealings with the supplier.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The wholesaler failed to confine its sales of a brand or brands to the assigned sales territory. This subdivision does not apply if there is a dispute between 2 or more wholesalers as to the boundaries of the assigned territory, and the boundaries cannot be determined by a reading of the description contained in the agreements between the supplier and the wholesalers.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The sale by the wholesaler of any brand or brands sold by the supplier to the wholesaler and known by the wholesaler to be ineligible for sale prior to the actual sale to the retailer. The supplier shall repurchase the ineligible product from the wholesaler when the ineligibility is caused by the supplier. The supplier must give the wholesaler written notice specifying the ineligible product. This subdivision does not apply when a supplier ships a brand or brands to a wholesaler that must be removed within 60 days of the deadline for retail sale of the product. This 60-day period shall commence upon receipt of the product by the wholesaler.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   Notwithstanding subsections (7), (10), (11), and (12), a supplier may terminate, cancel, not renew, or discontinue an agreement upon not less than 30 days' prior written notice if the supplier discontinues production or discontinues distribution in this state of all the brands sold by the supplier to the wholesaler. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a supplier upon not less than 30 days' notice to discontinue the distribution of any particular brand or package of beer. This subsection does not prohibit a supplier from conducting test marketing of a new brand of beer or from conducting the test marketing of a brand of beer which is not currently being sold in this state provided that the supplier has notified the commission in writing of its plans to test market. The notice shall describe the market area in which the test shall be conducted; the name or names of the wholesaler or wholesalers who will be selling the beer; the name or names of the brand of beer being tested; and the period of time during which the testing will take place. A market testing period shall not exceed 18 months.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(16)   A supplier shall not withhold consent to any transfer of a wholesaler's business if the proposed transferee meets the material and reasonable qualifications and standards required by the supplier. A wholesaler shall give the supplier written notice of intent to transfer the wholesaler's business. A supplier shall not unreasonably delay a response to a request for a proposed transfer of a wholesaler's business. However, a transfer of a wholesaler's business which is not approved by the supplier shall be null and void. A supplier shall not interfere with, or prevent, the transfer of the wholesaler's business if the proposed transferee is a designated member.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(17)   A supplier that has amended, canceled, terminated, or refused to renew any agreement; has caused a wholesaler to resign from an agreement; or has withheld consent to any assignment or transfer of a wholesaler's business, except as provided for in this section, shall pay the wholesaler reasonable compensation for the diminished value of the wholesaler's business or of any ancillary business which has been negatively affected by the act of the supplier, or both. The value of the wholesaler's business or ancillary business shall include, but not be limited to, its good will.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(18)   Either party may, at any time, determine that mutual agreement on the amount of reasonable compensation cannot be reached. Should such a determination be made, the supplier or the wholesaler shall send written notice to the other party declaring their intention to proceed with arbitration. Arbitration shall proceed only by mutual agreement of both parties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(19)   The matter of determining the amount of compensation under arbitration may, by agreement of the parties, be submitted to a 5-member arbitration panel consisting of 2 representatives selected by the supplier but unassociated with the affected supplier, 2 wholesaler representatives selected by the wholesaler but unassociated with the wholesaler, and an impartial arbitrator.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(20)   Not more than 10 days after the notice to enter into arbitration has been sent, each party shall request, in writing, a list of 5 arbitrators from the American arbitration association. Not more than 10 days after the receipt of the list of 5 choices, the wholesaler arbitrators and the supplier arbitrators may strike and disqualify up to 2 names each from the list. Should either party fail to respond within the 10 days or should more than 1 name remain, the American arbitration association shall make the selection of the impartial arbitrator.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(21)   Not more than 30 days after the list of arbitrators is received, the wholesaler and supplier shall exchange in writing the names of their respective arbitration panel representatives.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(22)   Not more than 30 days after the final selection of the arbitration panel is made, the arbitration panel shall convene to decide the dispute. The panel shall render a decision by majority vote of the participants within 20 days from the conclusion of the arbitration.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(23)   The cost of the impartial arbitrator, the stenographer, and the meeting site shall be equally divided between the wholesaler and the supplier. All other costs shall be paid by the party incurring them. The award of the arbitration panel shall be final and binding on the parties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(24)   After both parties have agreed to arbitrate should either party fail to abide by the time limitations as prescribed in subsections (20), (21), and (22), or fail or refuse to make the selection of any arbitrators, or fail to participate in the arbitration hearings, the other party shall make the selection of their arbitrators and proceed to arbitration. The party who has failed or refused to comply as prescribed in this subsection shall be considered to be in default. Any party considered to be in default pursuant to this subsection shall have waived any and all rights the party would have had in the arbitration and shall be considered to have consented to the determination of the arbitration panel.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(25)   A wholesaler shall not waive any of the rights granted in any provision of this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or prohibit good faith dispute settlements voluntarily entered into by the parties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(26)   A successor to a supplier that continues in business as a brewer, an outstate seller of beer, or a master distributor shall be bound by all terms and conditions of each agreement of the supplier with a wholesaler licensed in this state that were in effect on the date on which the successor received the distribution rights of the previous supplier.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(27)   This section shall apply to agreements in existence on June 26, 1984, as well as agreements entered into or renewed after that date.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(28)   If a supplier engages in conduct prohibited under this section, a wholesaler with which the supplier has an agreement may maintain a civil action against the supplier to recover actual damages reasonably incurred as the result of the prohibited conduct. If a wholesaler engages in conduct prohibited under this section, a supplier with which the wholesaler has an agreement may maintain a civil action against the wholesaler to recover actual damages reasonably incurred as the result of the prohibited conduct.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(29)   A supplier that violates any provision of this section is liable for all actual damages and all court costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by a wholesaler as a result of that violation. A wholesaler that violates any provision of this section is liable for all actual damages and all court costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the supplier as a result of that violation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(30)   A supplier or wholesaler may bring an action for declaratory judgment for determination of any controversy arising pursuant to this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(31)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a court finds that a supplier has not acted in good faith in effecting an amendment, termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal of any agreement; or has unreasonably withheld its consent to any assignment, transfer, or sale of a wholesaler's business, it may award exemplary damages, as well as actual damages, court costs, and reasonable attorney fees to the wholesaler who has been damaged by the action of the supplier.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(32)   Upon proper application to the court, a supplier or wholesaler may obtain injunctive relief against any violation of this section. If the court grants injunctive relief or issues a temporary restraining order, bond shall not be required to be posted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(33)   The procedure for resolving any violation of subsection (3)(a), (b), (c), (e), (f), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), or (4) shall be the procedure prescribed by this act and the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328. Any other violation of or dispute regarding this section, unless the dispute is resolved pursuant to subsections (18) to (24), shall only be resolved by a civil action in court as provided in this section and not by the commission.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in this section, the commission shall levy and collect a tax on all beer manufactured or sold in this state at the rate of $6.30 per barrel if the beer is sold in bulk or in different quantities. Before February 1, 2015, the tax must be paid by the brewer or brewpub if manufactured in this state or by the wholesaler or the person from whom purchased if manufactured outside this state, whichever is designated by the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Beginning on and after February 1, 2015, the tax under this section must be paid by the brewer or brewpub if the beer is manufactured in this state or if the beer is manufactured outside this state the tax must be paid by the wholesaler assigned to distribute that beer and the tax must be levied and collected on the number of barrels the wholesaler actually sold to licensed retailers in this state. A brewer may designate a wholesaler to pay the tax on behalf of the brewer.

Beginning March 15, 2020, the commission shall not require that the tax be paid in less than quarterly intervals.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The tax levied under subsection (1) must not be collected on beer that is consumed on the premises of the manufacturer or is damaged in the process of brewing, packaging, storage, and distribution and is not offered for sale, except that beer sold by a brewpub for consumption on the premises or beer produced and consumed on the premises of a micro brewer is subject to the tax levied under subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The tax levied under subsection (1) must be rebated to the person that paid the tax if the person provides satisfactory proof to the commission that the beer was shipped outside of this state for sale and consumption outside this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For the purposes of the tax levied under subsection (1), a barrel of beer contains 31 gallons.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The commission may promulgate a rule that designates the states or the laws or the rules of other states that require a licensed wholesaler of beer to pay an additional fee for the right to purchase, import, or sell beer manufactured in this state; that denies the issuance of a license authorizing the importation of beer to any wholesaler of beer in that state who applies for the license; that prohibits wholesalers of beer in that state from possessing or selling beer purchased in this state, unless the person from whom the beer was purchased has secured a license and paid a fee in that state, if the seller does not transport the beer into the state and does not sell the beer in the state; or that imposes any higher taxes or inspection fees on beer manufactured in this state when transporting the beer into or selling the beer in that state than taxes or fees imposed on beer manufactured and sold within that state. A rule promulgated under this subsection must prohibit all licensees from purchasing, receiving, possessing, or selling any beer manufactured in any state designated in the rule. A rule promulgated under this subsection becomes effective as provided in section 47 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.247. Any licensee or person adversely affected by a rule promulgated under this subsection is entitled to review by leave to a court of competent jurisdiction regarding the question as to whether the commission acted illegally or in excess of its authority in making its finding under this subsection with respect to any state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Regardless of whether the tax was remitted to this state by the eligible brewer or a designated wholesaler, an eligible brewer may claim a credit or request a refund, in a manner as determined by the commission, against the tax levied under subsection (1) in the amount of $2.00 per barrel for the first 30,000 barrels. As used in this subsection, "eligible brewer" means a brewer, whether or not located in this state, or brewpub that manufactures not more than 60,000 barrels of beer during the tax year for which the credit is claimed. In determining the number of barrels for purposes of the credit, all brands and labels of a brewer must be combined and all facilities for the production of beer that are owned or controlled by the same person is treated as a single facility.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The commission may issue licenses as provided in this act on the payment of the fees provided in section 525 and the filing of liability insurance as provided in section 803. The commission shall provide a notification of the ability of the purchaser or transferee to obtain a tax clearance certificate, as provided in subsection (6). Subject to section 906(2) and (3), the commission shall not issue a new on premises license or transfer more than 50% interest in an existing on premises license unless the applicant or transferee offers proof acceptable to the commission that he or she has employed or has present on the licensed premises, at a minimum, supervisory personnel on each shift and during all hours in which alcoholic liquor is served who have successfully completed a server training program described in section 906. The commission may consider an individual enrolled and actively participating in a server training program as having successfully completed the program for the time the individual is participating. The commission may allow an applicant or a conditionally approved licensee at least 180 days, or more on a showing of good cause, to meet the minimum personnel training requirements of this subsection. The commission may suspend the license of a conditionally approved licensee if that licensee does not comply with this subsection. The commission may waive the server training requirements of this subsection on the basis of either of the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The licensee's responsible operating experience or training.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The person's demonstration of an acceptable level of responsible operation either as a licensee during the preceding 3 years or as a manager with substantial experience in serving alcoholic liquor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A full-year license issued by the commission expires on April 30 following the date of issuance or the date fixed by the commission. A license issued under this act is a contract between the commission and the licensee and shall be signed by both parties. If a licensee dies, the commission may approve a personal representative or independent personal representative appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction to operate the establishment, pending the settlement of the estate of the deceased licensee. The commission may approve a receiver or trustee appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction to operate the licensed establishment of a licensee. The commission may grant a part-year license for a proportionate part of the license fee specified in section 525. In a resort area the commission shall grant a license for a period of time as short as 3 months. A license may be transferred with the consent of the commission. A class C or specially designated distributor license obtained in a manner other than by transfer must not be transferred within 3 years after it is issued except under circumstances where the licensee clearly and convincingly demonstrates that unusual hardship will result if the transfer does not receive the consent of the commission. An application for a license to sell alcoholic liquor for consumption on the premises, except in a city having a population of 600,000 or more, must be approved by the local legislative body in which the applicant's place of business is located before the license is granted by the commission, except that for an application for renewal of an existing license, if an objection to a renewal has not been filed with the commission by the local legislative body not less than 30 days before the date of expiration of the license, the approval of the local legislative body is not required. The commission shall provide the local legislative body and the local chief of police with the name, home and business addresses, and home and business phone numbers to accomplish the local legislative reviews of new and transferred license applications required by this subsection. On request of the local legislative body after due notice and proper hearing by the local legislative body and the commission, the commission shall revoke the license of a licensee granted a license to sell alcoholic liquor for consumption on the premises or any permit held in conjunction with that license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A local legislative body, by resolution, may request that the commission revoke the license of a licensee granted a license to sell alcoholic liquor for consumption off the premises whose place of business is located within the local legislative body's jurisdiction and that has been determined in commission violation hearings to have sold or furnished alcoholic liquor, on at least 3 separate occasions in a consecutive 12-month period, to a minor if those violations did not involve the use of falsified or fraudulent identification by the minor. If the commission verifies that the licensee who is the subject of the resolution has been found to have committed the violations as prescribed in this subsection, the commission may suspend or revoke the licensee's license and any permit held in conjunction with that license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) This act does not prohibit a hotel that is or was the holder of a license authorizing the retail sale of alcoholic liquor for consumption on the premises from applying for and receiving under this act any other and different type of license authorizing the retail sale of alcoholic liquor for consumption on the premises. The application for the license is not considered a new application for a license if the total number of public licenses for consumption on the premises does not exceed the authorized total established in this act and the sale of alcoholic liquor is approved by the electors. The commission may divide the state into 3 zones and establish for each zone an anniversary date for renewal of full-year retail licenses in the licensing year. The commission shall promulgate rules under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, for the effective administration of the renewal of licenses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The commission, with the written approval of the department of agriculture and rural development for the Michigan state fairgrounds and the Upper Peninsula state fairgrounds, may issue without regard to the quota provision of section 531 a tavern license to a person as concessionaire leasing or renting a portion of either the Upper Peninsula state fairgrounds or the state fairgrounds, or both, to service the licensed area in use for recreational or exhibition purposes other than at the time of the annual Upper Peninsula state fair under section 2 of 1927 PA 89, MCL 285.142. A license issued under this subsection is not transferable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The application for initial licensure or for a transfer of a license shall contain a notice in substantial compliance with the following:
<B></B><table>
    <tr>
      <td>

      <td>When
  purchasing a license, a buyer can be held liable for tax debts incurred by

  issuance. Obtaining sound professional assistance from an attorney or

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the commission requires an applicant to submit fingerprints, the applicant shall have the fingerprints taken by a local law enforcement agency, the department of state police, or any other person qualified to take fingerprints as determined by the department of state police. The applicant shall submit the fingerprints and the appropriate state and federal fees, which shall be borne by the applicant, to the department of state police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a criminal history check. After conducting the criminal history check, the department of state police shall provide the commission with a report of the criminal history check.

If a criminal arrest fingerprint card is subsequently submitted to the department of state police and matches against a fingerprint that was submitted under this act and stored in its automated fingerprint identification system (AFIS) database, the department of state police shall notify the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except for a resort or resort economic development license issued under section 531(2), (3), (4), or (5) or a license issued under section 521a, the commission shall issue an initial or renewal license not later than 90 days after the applicant files a completed application. The application is considered to be received the date the application is received by an agency or department of this state. If the commission determines that an application is incomplete, the commission shall notify the applicant in writing, or make the information electronically available, within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The determination of the completeness of an application is not an approval of the application for the license and does not confer eligibility on an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license. The 90-day period is tolled for the following periods under any of the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If notice is sent by the commission of a deficiency in the application, until the date all of the requested information is received by the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For the time required to complete actions required by a person, other than the applicant or the commission, including, but not limited to, completion of construction or renovation of the licensed premises; mandated inspections by the commission or by any state, local, or federal agency; approval by the legislative body of a local unit of government; criminal history or criminal record checks; financial or court record checks; or other actions mandated by this act or rule or as otherwise mandated by law or local ordinance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the commission fails to issue or deny a license within the time required by this section, the commission shall return the license fee and shall reduce the license fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. The failure to issue a license within the time required under this section does not allow the commission to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and the application, on completion, must be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The commission shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application because the license fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If, in addition to a completed application under this section, an applicant submits a separate form requesting a conditional license with an acceptable proof of financial responsibility form under section 803, an executed property document, and, for an application to transfer the location of an existing retailer license other than specially designated distributor license, a church or school proximity affidavit on a form prescribed by the commission attesting that the proposed location is not within 500 feet of a church or school building using the method of measurement required under section 503, the commission shall, after considering the arrest and conviction records or previous violation history in the management, operation, or ownership of a licensed business, approve or deny a conditional license. A conditional license issued under subsection (7) must only include any existing permits and approvals held in connection with the license, other than permits or approvals for which the conditional applicant does not meet the requirements in this act or rules promulgated under this act, or permits or approvals that the conditional applicant has requested to cancel as part of the application that serves as the basis for the conditional license. The commission shall not issue a new permit with a conditional license issued under subsection (7). The following applicants may request a conditional license:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An applicant seeking to transfer ownership of an existing retailer license at the same location to sell alcoholic liquor for consumption on or off the premises.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An applicant seeking to transfer the ownership and location of an existing retailer license, other than a specially designated distributor license, to sell alcoholic liquor for consumption on or off the premises.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An applicant seeking a new specially designated merchant license, other than a specially designated merchant license issued under section 533(6), not to be held in conjunction with a license for the sale of alcoholic liquor for consumption on the premises.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The commission shall issue a conditional license to applicants approved under subsection (6) within 20 business days after receipt of a completed application and a completed conditional license request form and documentation for a conditional license at a single location. The commission may take up to 30 business days to issue conditional licenses to approved applicants seeking conditional licenses at multiple locations. However, for an applicant described under this subsection that is seeking a specially designated merchant license under section 533(7), the commission may take up to 45 business days to issue a conditional license. Notwithstanding the applicant's submission of a church or school proximity affidavit under subsection (6), if the commission determines that a conditional license in conjunction with an application to transfer the location of an existing retailer license has been issued under this subsection at a proposed location that is within 500 feet of a church or school building, the commission shall suspend the conditional license and notify the church or school of the proposed location under the rules promulgated under this act. If the commission issues a conditional license under this subsection based on a church or school proximity affidavit under subsection (6) without knowledge that the representations included in the affidavit are incorrect, this state is not liable to any person for the commission's issuance of the conditional license. The commission may assume without inquiry the existence of the facts contained in the affidavit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A conditional license approved under subsection (6) and issued under subsection (7) is nontransferable and nonrenewable. A conditional licensee is required to comply with the server training requirements in section 501(1) beginning on the date a conditional license is issued under subsection (7) regardless of whether the conditional licensee is actively operating under the conditional license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A conditional license approved under subsection (6) and issued under subsection (7) expires when the first of the following occurs:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The commission issues an order of denial of the license application that serves as the basis for the conditional license and all administrative remedies before the commission have been exhausted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The commission issues the license under subsection (4) for which the applicant submitted the license application that serves as the basis for the conditional license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The licensee or conditional licensee notifies the commission in writing that the initial or conditional application should be canceled.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) One year passes after the date the conditional license was issued, notwithstanding any suspension of the conditional license by the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If a conditional licensee fails to maintain acceptable proof of its financial responsibility as required under section 803, the commission shall summarily suspend the conditional license under section 92(2) of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.292, until the conditional licensee files an acceptable proof of financial responsibility form under section 803. If a conditional license is revoked, the conditional licensee shall not recover from this state or a unit of local government any compensation for property, future income, or future economic loss because of the revocation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) On issuing a conditional license under subsection (7), the commission shall, until the conditional license expires under subsection (9), place the existing license under subsection (4) for which the applicant submitted the application that serves as the basis for the conditional license in escrow in compliance with R 436.1107 of the Michigan Administrative Code. If the conditional license expires under subsection (9), an existing licensee may do 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Request that the commission release the license from escrow.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Keep the license in escrow. The escrow date for compliance with R 436.1107 of the Michigan Administrative Code is the date the conditional license expires.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The chair of the commission shall submit a report by December 1 of each year to the standing committees and appropriations subcommittees of the senate and house of representatives concerned with liquor license issues. The chair of the commission shall include all of the following information in the report concerning the preceding fiscal year:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The number of initial and renewal applications the commission received and completed within the 90-day time period described in subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The number of applications denied.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The number of applicants not issued a license within the 90-day time period and the amount of money returned to licensees under subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) As used in this section, "completed application" means an application complete on its face and submitted with any applicable licensing fees as well as any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of this state.</div>

A minor who violates this subsection is responsible for a state civil infraction or guilty of a misdemeanor as follows and is not subject to the penalties prescribed in section 909:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For the first violation, the minor is responsible for a state civil infraction and must be fined not more than $100.00. A court may order a minor under this subdivision to participate in substance use disorder services as defined in section 6230 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.6230, and designated by the administrator of the office of substance abuse services, and may order the minor to perform community service and to undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at his or her own expense as described in subsection (5). A minor may be found responsible or admit responsibility only once under this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If a violation of this subsection occurs after 1 prior judgment, the minor is guilty of a misdemeanor. A misdemeanor under this subdivision is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 30 days if the court finds that the minor violated an order of probation, failed to successfully complete any treatment, screening, or community service ordered by the court, or failed to pay any fine for that conviction or juvenile adjudication, or by a fine of not more than $200.00, or both. A court may order a minor under this subdivision to participate in substance use disorder services as defined in section 6230 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.6230, and designated by the administrator of the office of substance abuse services, to perform community service, and to undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at his or her own expense as described in subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If a violation of this subsection occurs after 2 or more prior judgments, the minor is guilty of a misdemeanor. A misdemeanor under this subdivision is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 60 days, if the court finds that the minor violated an order of probation, failed to successfully complete any treatment, screening, or community service ordered by the court, or failed to pay any fine for that conviction or juvenile adjudication, or by a fine of not more than $500.00, or both, as applicable. A court may order a minor under this subdivision to participate in substance use disorder services as defined in section 6230 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.6230, and designated by the administrator of the office of substance abuse services, to perform community service, and to undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at his or her own expense as described in subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An individual who furnishes fraudulent identification to a minor or, notwithstanding subsection (1), a minor who uses fraudulent identification to purchase alcoholic liquor, is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $100.00, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If an individual who pleads guilty to a misdemeanor violation of subsection (1)(b) or offers a plea of admission in a juvenile delinquency proceeding for a misdemeanor violation of subsection (1)(b), the court, without entering a judgment of guilt in a criminal proceeding or a determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the juvenile has committed the offense and with the consent of the accused, may defer further proceedings and place the individual on probation. The terms and conditions of that probation include, but are not limited to, the sanctions set forth in subsection (1)(c), payment of the costs including minimum state cost as provided for in section 18m of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.18m, and section 1j of chapter IX of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 769.1j, and the costs of probation as prescribed in section 3 of chapter XI of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 771.3. If a court finds that an individual violated a term or condition of probation or that the individual is utilizing this subsection in another court, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt, or a determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the individual has committed the offense, and proceed as otherwise provided by law. If an individual fulfills the terms and conditions of probation, the court shall discharge the individual and dismiss the proceedings. A discharge and dismissal under this section is without adjudication of guilt or without a determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the individual has committed the offense and is not a conviction or juvenile adjudication for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law on conviction of a crime. An individual may obtain only 1 discharge and dismissal under this subsection. The court shall maintain a nonpublic record of the matter while proceedings are deferred and the individual is on probation and if there is a discharge and dismissal under this subsection. The secretary of state shall retain a nonpublic record of a plea and of the discharge and dismissal under this subsection. These records shall be furnished to any of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) To the department of corrections, a prosecutor, or a law enforcement agency, on the department's, a prosecutor's, or a law enforcement agency's request, subject to all of the following conditions:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The record is used by the department of corrections, the prosecutor, or the law enforcement agency only to determine whether an employee has violated his or her conditions of employment or whether an applicant meets criteria for employment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A misdemeanor violation of subsection (1) successfully deferred, discharged, and dismissed under subsection (3) is considered a prior judgment for the purposes of subsection (1)(c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A court may order an individual found responsible for or convicted of violating subsection (1) to undergo screening and assessment by a person or agency as designated by the department-designated community mental health entity as defined in section 100a of the mental health code, 1974 PA 258, MCL 330.1100a, to determine whether the individual is likely to benefit from rehabilitative services, including alcohol or drug education and alcohol or drug treatment programs. A court may order an individual subject to a misdemeanor conviction or juvenile adjudication of, or placed on probation regarding, a violation of subsection (1) to submit to a random or regular preliminary chemical breath analysis.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A law enforcement agency, on determining that an individual who is less than 18 years of age and not emancipated under 1968 PA 293, MCL 722.1 to 722.6, allegedly consumed, possessed, or purchased alcoholic liquor, attempted to consume, possess, or purchase alcoholic liquor, or had any bodily alcohol content in violation of subsection (1) shall notify the parent or parents, custodian, or guardian of the individual as to the nature of the violation if the name of a parent, guardian, or custodian is reasonably ascertainable by the law enforcement agency. The law enforcement agency shall notify the parent, guardian, or custodian not later than 48 hours after the law enforcement agency determines that the individual who allegedly violated subsection (1) is less than 18 years of age and not emancipated under 1968 PA 293, MCL 722.1 to 722.6. The law enforcement agency may notify the parent, guardian, or custodian by any means reasonably calculated to give prompt actual notice including, but not limited to, notice in person, by telephone, or by first-class mail. If an individual less than 17 years of age is incarcerated for violating subsection (1), his or her parents or legal guardian must be notified immediately as provided in this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) This section does not prohibit a minor from possessing alcoholic liquor during regular working hours and in the course of his or her employment if employed by a person licensed by this act, by the commission, or by an agent of the commission, if the alcoholic liquor is not possessed for his or her personal consumption.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A minor who initiates contact with a peace officer or emergency medical services personnel for the purpose of obtaining medical assistance for a legitimate health care concern.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If a minor who is less than 18 years of age and who is not emancipated under 1968 PA 293, MCL 722.1 to 722.6, voluntarily presents himself or herself to a health facility or agency for treatment or for observation as provided under subsection (9), the health facility or agency shall notify the parent or parents, guardian, or custodian of the individual as to the nature of the treatment or observation if the name of a parent, guardian, or custodian is reasonably ascertainable by the health facility or agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) This section does not limit the civil or criminal liability of a vendor or the vendor's clerk, servant, agent, or employee for a violation of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The consumption of alcoholic liquor by a minor who is enrolled in a course offered by an accredited postsecondary educational institution in an academic building of the institution under the supervision of a faculty member is not prohibited by this act if the purpose of the consumption is solely educational and is a requirement of the course.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) The state police, the commission, or a local police agency shall not recruit or attempt to recruit a minor for participation in an undercover operation at the scene of a violation of subsection (1), section 701(1), or section 801(1). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) In a prosecution for the violation of subsection (1) concerning a minor having any bodily alcohol content, it is an affirmative defense that the minor consumed the alcoholic liquor in a venue or location where that consumption is legal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) As used in this section: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Any bodily alcohol content" means either of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A retail licensee shall not directly, individually, or by a clerk, agent, or servant sell, furnish, or give alcoholic liquor to a minor except as otherwise provided in this act. A retail licensee shall not directly or indirectly, individually or by a clerk, agent, or servant sell, furnish, or give alcoholic liquor to an individual who is visibly intoxicated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an individual who suffers damage or who is personally injured by a minor or visibly intoxicated person by reason of the unlawful selling, giving, or furnishing of alcoholic liquor to the minor or visibly intoxicated person, if the unlawful sale is proven to be a proximate cause of the damage, injury, or death, or the spouse, child, parent, or guardian of that individual, has a right of action in his or her name against the person who by selling, giving, or furnishing the alcoholic liquor has caused or contributed to the intoxication of the person or who has caused or contributed to the damage, injury, or death. In an action under this section, the plaintiff has the right to recover actual damages in a sum of not less than $50.00 in each case in which the court or jury determines that intoxication was a proximate cause of the damage, injury, or death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An action under this section must be instituted within 2 years after the injury or death. A plaintiff seeking damages under this section shall give written notice to all defendants within 120 days after entering an attorney-client relationship for the purpose of pursuing a claim under this section. Failure to give written notice within the time specified is grounds for dismissal of a claim as to any defendants that did not receive that notice unless sufficient information for determining that a retail licensee might be liable under this section was not known and could not reasonably have been known within the 120 days. In the event of the death of either party, the right of action under this section survives to or against his or her personal representative. In each action by a husband, wife, child, or parent, the general reputation of the relation of husband and wife or parent and child is prima facie evidence of the relation, and the amount recovered by either the husband, wife, parent, or child is his or her sole and separate property. The damages, together with the costs of the action, must be recovered in an action under this section. If the parents of the individual who suffered damage or who was personally injured are entitled to damages under this section, the father and mother may sue separately, but recovery by 1 is a bar to action by the other.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An action under this section against a retail licensee must not be commenced unless the minor or the alleged intoxicated person is a named defendant in the action and is retained in the action until the litigation is concluded by trial or settlement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Any licensee subject to subsection (2) regarding the unlawful selling, furnishing, or giving of alcoholic liquor to a visibly intoxicated person has the right to full indemnification from the alleged visibly intoxicated person for all damages awarded against the licensee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) All defenses of the alleged visibly intoxicated person or the minor are available to the licensee. In an action alleging the unlawful sale of alcoholic liquor to a minor, proof that the defendant retail licensee or the defendant's agent or employee demanded and was shown a Michigan driver license or official state personal identification card, appearing to be genuine and showing that the minor was at least 21 years of age, is a defense to the action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) There is a rebuttable presumption that a retail licensee, other than the retail licensee who last sold, gave, or furnished alcoholic liquor to the minor or the visibly intoxicated person, has not committed any act giving rise to a cause of action under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The alleged visibly intoxicated person does not have a cause of action under this section and a person does not have a cause of action under this section for the loss of financial support, services, gifts, parental training, guidance, love, society, or companionship of the alleged visibly intoxicated person. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) This section provides the exclusive remedy for money damages against a licensee arising out of the selling, giving, or furnishing of alcoholic liquor to a minor or intoxicated person.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Except as otherwise provided for under this section and section 815, a civil action under subsection (2) against a retail licensee is subject to the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.101 to 600.9947.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If an action is instituted against a retailer as defendant in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the liability provided in section 801 and service of process has not been effected in the manner provided for by law, and either the sheriff or constable to whom process has been delivered for service shall make return that he or she has not been able to serve the defendant for a period of 30 days, in which period he or she has made 3 or more attempts to serve the defendant at his or her residence or place of business, or the plaintiff or another person with knowledge of the facts files an affidavit in the cause stating that the defendant has ceased to be a resident of the state of Michigan or has been absent from the state for a continuous period of 6 months, then it shall be competent for the plaintiff to cause service of process to be made upon the defendant by service of the process upon the commission, the liability for which suit is brought arose during the period in which the defendant was a licensed retailer and was insured under the provisions of section 803. Such service of process shall be made in duplicate on the commission, and return showing such service shall be made to the court. The commission shall mail a copy of the process served upon it to the defendant at the address shown in the consent to service of process, and shall immediately transmit to the clerk of the court in which the action is pending an acknowledgment of the mailing of the copy of that process by the commission to the defendant. Whenever the foregoing provisions of this section have been complied with, the court may proceed to hear and determine the matter as fully and effectually as though the defendant retailer had been personally served with process within the jurisdiction of the court. The commission shall also notify the insurer under the liability policy of the defendant, on file with the commission, that the commission has received service of that process, stating the names of the parties to the action and the court in which the action is pending. If the defendant retailer is deceased, service of process may be made upon the executor or administrator of the deceased defendant by service on the commission, in an action in which that service would be authorized by this section upon the defendant if he or she were living, in the manner provided in this section. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    In defense of a civil action under section 801, a retail licensee may present evidence that, at the time of the selling, giving, or furnishing of the alcoholic liquor, the retail licensee was adhering to responsible business practices. Responsible business practices are those business policies, procedures, and actions which an ordinarily prudent person would follow in like circumstances.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A person, directly or indirectly, himself or herself or by his or her clerk, agent, or employee, shall not manufacture, manufacture for sale, sell, offer or keep for sale, barter, furnish, import, import for sale, transport for hire, transport, or possess any alcoholic liquor unless the person complies with this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A licensee shall not allow unlawful gambling on the licensed premises and shall not allow on the licensed premises any gaming devices prohibited by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A licensee shall not sell, offer or keep for sale, furnish, possess, or allow a customer to consume alcoholic liquor that is not authorized by the license issued to the licensee by the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A person, whether or not a licensee, shall not sell, deliver, or import spirits unless the sale, delivery, or importation is made by the commission, the commission's authorized agent or distributor, an authorized distribution agent certified by order of the commission, a person licensed by the commission, or by prior written order of the commission. A person who violates this subsection is subject to the sanctions and penalties contained in section 909(4) and, in the case of a violation of section 909(4)(a), is subject to forfeiture of proceeds or an instrumentality as provided for in chapter XXVA of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.159f to 750.159x.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The commission or any commissioner or duly authorized agent of the commission designated by the chairperson of the commission, on notice and proper hearing, may suspend or revoke any license on a violation of this act or any of the rules promulgated by the commission under this act. The commission or any commissioner or authorized agent of the commission designated by the chairperson of the commission, may assess a penalty of not more than $300.00 for each violation of this act or rules promulgated under this act, or not more than $1,000.00 for each violation of section 801(1), in addition to or instead of revocation or suspension of the license, which penalty must be paid to the commission and deposited with the state treasurer and must be credited to the general fund of the state. The commission shall hold a hearing and order the suspension or revocation of a license if the licensee has been found liable for 3 or more separate violations of section 801(1) which violations occurred on different occasions within a 24-month period unless the violations for the sale, furnishing, or giving alcoholic liquor to a minor were discovered by the licensee and disclosed to an appropriate law enforcement agency immediately on discovery. A retail licensee who sells, offers to sell, accepts, furnishes, possesses, or allows the consumption of spirits in violation of section 901(6) is subject to an administrative fine of not more than $2,500.00 per occurrence and the following license sanctions after notice and opportunity for an administrative hearing under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For a first violation, a license revocation or suspension for between 1 and 30 days.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For a second violation, a license revocation or suspension for between 31 and 90 days.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For a third or subsequent violation, revocation of the license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The commission shall provide a procedure by which a licensee who is aggrieved by any penalty imposed under subsection (1) and any suspension or revocation of a license ordered by the commission, a commissioner, or a duly authorized agent of the commission may request a hearing for the purpose of presenting any facts or reasons to the commission as to why the penalty, suspension, or revocation should be modified or rescinded. The request must be in writing and accompanied by a fee of $25.00. The commission, after reviewing the record made before a commissioner or an authorized agent of the commission, may allow or refuse to allow the hearing in accordance with the commission's rules. The right to a hearing provided in this subsection, however, must not be interpreted by a court as curtailing, removing, or annulling the right of the commission to suspend or revoke licenses as provided for in this act. A licensee does not have a right of appeal from the final determination of the commission, except by leave of the circuit court. Notice of the order of suspension or revocation of a license or of the assessment of a penalty, or both, must be given in the manner prescribed by the commission. The suspension or revocation of a license or the assessment of a penalty, or both, by the commission or an authorized agent of the commission does not prohibit the institution of a criminal prosecution for a violation of this act. The institution of a criminal prosecution for a violation of this act or the acquittal or conviction of a person for a violation of this act does not prevent the suspension or revocation of a license or the assessment of a penalty, or both, by the commission. In a hearing for the suspension or revocation of a license issued under this act, proof that the defendant licensee or an agent or employee of the licensee demanded and was shown, before furnishing any alcoholic liquor to a minor, a motor vehicle operator or chauffeur license or a registration certificate issued by the federal selective service, or other bona fide documentary evidence of majority and identity of the person, may be offered as evidence in a defense to a proceeding for the suspension or revocation of a license issued under this act. A licensee who has reason to believe that a minor has used fraudulent identification to purchase alcoholic liquor in violation of section 703 shall file a police report concerning the violation with a local law enforcement agency and shall also present the alleged fraudulent identification to the local law enforcement agency at the time of filing the report if the identification is in the possession of the licensee. The commission may promulgate rules under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, regarding the use by licensees of equipment designed to detect altered or forged driver licenses, state identification cards, and other forms of identification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In addition to the hearing commissioners provided for in section 209, the chairperson of the commission may designate not more than 2 authorized agents to hear violation cases. A person appointed under this subsection must be a member in good standing of the State Bar of Michigan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An authorized agent who has been designated by the chairperson under subsection (3) has, in the hearing of violation cases, the same authority and responsibility as does a hearing commissioner under this act and the rules promulgated under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An authorized agent who has been designated by the chairperson under subsection (3) is ineligible for appointment to the commission for a period of 1 year after the person ceases to serve as an authorized agent.</div>
