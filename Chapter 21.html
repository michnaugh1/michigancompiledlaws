If any examination discloses malfeasance, misfeasance, nonfeasance, or gross neglect of duty on the part of any officer or employee of any county office, for which a criminal penalty is provided by law, an additional copy of the report shall be made and filed with the attorney general, and the attorney general, within 60 days after receipt of that report, shall institute criminal proceedings against the officer or employee, or direct that criminal proceedings be instituted by the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the offense was committed. The attorney general, or the prosecuting attorney, as the case may be, also shall institute civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction for the recovery of any public money, disclosed by any examinations to have been illegally expended, or collected and not accounted for and for the recovery of any public property disclosed to have been converted and misappropriated.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The executive officer of each county office shall adopt and use the books, forms, records and systems of accounting and reporting prescribed by the state treasurer and shall promptly purchase the books, forms, and records as may be necessary to implement their use, in the manner now provided by law for the purchase of those articles. Refusal or neglect on the part of any county officer to provide the books, forms, or records, or to use them, or to make the reports required by this act, or keep the accounts of his or her office as directed by the state treasurer, is sufficient cause for his or her removal from office by the governor. If, after the uniform accounting system has been installed in any county, it becomes necessary for an examiner employed under this act to perform any service, which a county officer has neglected or refused to do, in order to properly continue the system, then the per diem and expense incurred is a proper charge against the county where the service was performed. A statement covering that per diem and expense may be forwarded by the state treasurer to the county clerk who shall immediately issue his or her warrant upon the county treasurer who shall pay it from the general fund of the county.
