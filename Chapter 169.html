If, within 10 business days after the date of service of the inventory statement, the candidate does not file with the secretary of state a demand for a hearing before the secretary of state or a person designated by the secretary of state, the money seized is forfeited to this state by operation of law. If, after a hearing before the secretary of state or a person designated by the secretary of state, the secretary of state or a person designated by the secretary of state determines that the money is lawfully subject to seizure and forfeiture and the candidate does not appeal to the circuit court of the county in which the seizure was made within the time prescribed in this section, the money seized is forfeited to this state by operation of law. If a candidate is aggrieved by the decision of the secretary of state or a person designated by the secretary of state, that candidate may appeal to the circuit court of the county where the seizure was made to obtain a judicial determination of the lawfulness of the seizure and forfeiture. The action must be commenced within 20 days after notice of a determination by the secretary of state or a person designated by the secretary of state is sent to the candidate. The court shall hear the action and determine the issues of fact and law involved in accordance with rules of practice and procedure as in other in rem proceedings.</div>

A connected organization may also pay actual costs related to mailing or shipping of an item or prize purchased under subsection (8). A separate segregated fund established by a connected organization under this section must be organized as a political committee or an independent committee, and, in addition to any other disbursements not restricted or prohibited by law, must only make contributions to, and expenditures on behalf of, candidate committees, ballot question committees, political party committees, political committees, independent expenditure committees, independent committees, and other separate segregated funds.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Contributions must not be obtained for a separate segregated fund established under this section by use of coercion or physical force, by making a contribution a condition of employment or membership, or by using or threatening to use job discrimination or financial reprisals. A connected organization may solicit or obtain contributions for a separate segregated fund established under this section from an individual described in subsection (2), (3), (4), or (5) on an automatic basis, including, but not limited to, a payroll deduction plan, only if the individual who is contributing to the fund affirmatively consents to the contribution. Affirmative consent does not expire until revoked by the individual who provided the affirmative consent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A contribution by an individual to a separate segregated fund may be collected by or made payable first to a connected organization of the separate segregated fund, for subsequent transfer to the separate segregated fund if all of the following occur:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For contributions that are aggregated with dues or other payments, the individual making the contribution does either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Specifically indicates in a record or electronic record that the amount collected, or a specified portion of the total amount if remitted as part of a dues or other payment to the connected organization, is a contribution to the separate segregated fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Fails to return a record or electronic record described in subparagraph (i), but remits payment to the connected organization in response to a specifically requested amount that includes a solicited contribution, the solicitation for a contribution was clearly distinguishable from any dues or other fees requested as part of the total, and the connected organization maintains a record or electronic record of the solicitation that includes the amount of the solicited contribution and the amount of any dues or other fees charged in conjunction with the solicitation for each contributor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The connected organization transfers the entire specified amount of any contribution, individually or aggregated with other contributions, for deposit to the separate segregated fund electronically or by written instrument. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The connected organization reports all information required under section 26 for each individual contributor, and a transfer of contributions for deposit to the separate segregated fund by a connected organization described in subsection (12)(a)(ii) must be accompanied by or logically associated with a record or electronic record that sets forth all required information for each individual whose contribution is transferred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The connected organization and the separate segregated fund have a written policy governing the handling, accounting, and transfer of any contribution under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) In connection with an investigation or hearing under section 15 regarding any contributions under this subsection, the connected organization voluntarily agrees to make available to the secretary of state any records described in subdivisions (a) to (d) and provides those records at the request of the secretary of state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) In addition to any other expenditures or disbursements allowed under subsection (1), a connected organization may make an in-kind contribution to pay costs for a prize, or 1 or more items to be sold or offered in exchange for a contribution, as part of fundraising activities for the separate segregated fund. Any in-kind contribution for payment of costs by the connected organization for a prize or per individual item to be sold or offered in exchange for a contribution must not be disproportionately valuable related to the amount raised by that prize or the amount to be raised or contributed per individual item sold or offered. It is not a violation of this subsection if the connected organization makes an in-kind contribution for a payment of costs under this subsection that is disproportionately valuable and the separate segregated fund reimburses at least the impermissible portion to the connected organization within 60 days of the payment, or as directed by the secretary of state under section 15. An in-kind contribution for a payment of costs under this subsection is disproportionately valuable unless both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The in-kind contribution is equal to or less than $5.00 per prize or per individual item to be sold or offered in exchange for a contribution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The in-kind contribution is equal to or less than 10% of the total amount raised by the prize, or if the payment of costs per item sold or offered in exchange for a contribution is equal to or less than 10% of the amount to be raised per individual item sold or offered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (8) and (11), a person that knowingly violates this section is guilty of a felony punishable, if the person is an individual, by imprisonment for not more than 3 years or a fine of not more than $5,000.00, or both, or, if the person is not an individual, by a fine of not more than $10,000.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If a connected organization that obtains contributions for a separate segregated fund from individuals described in subsection (2), (3), (4), or (5) pays to 1 or more of those individuals a bonus or other remuneration for the purpose of reimbursing those contributions, then that connected organization is subject to a civil fine of not more than 2 times the total contributions obtained from all individuals for the separate segregated fund during that calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If a violation of this section results solely from the failure of a connected organization to transfer 1 or more contributions, that connected organization is not guilty of a felony as described in subsection (9), but shall notify the contributor of the failure to transfer the contribution and refund the full amount of the contribution to the contributor if requested. The penalties described in subsection (9) apply to any other violation of this section, including use or diversion of any contributions by a connected organization before those contributions are transferred to the separate segregated fund under subsection (7).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Connected organization" means either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A corporation organized on a for-profit or nonprofit basis, a joint stock company, a domestic dependent sovereign, or a labor organization formed under the laws of this or another state or foreign country. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A member of any entity under subparagraph (i) that is not an individual and that does not maintain its own separate segregated fund, unless its separate segregated fund and the separate segregated fund of the entity of which it is a member are treated as a single independent committee as provided in section 52(10).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Record" and "electronic record" mean those terms as defined in section 2 of the uniform electronic transactions act, 2000 PA 305, MCL 450.832.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Written instrument" means a money order, or a check, cashier's check, or other negotiable instrument, as those terms are defined in section 3104 of the uniform commercial code, 1962 PA 174, MCL 440.3104, in the name of the connected organization and payable to the separate segregated fund.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A minor political party nominee whose party received 5% or more of the vote for the same office in the last election is entitled to an amount from the state campaign fund of not more than $1,125,000.00, multiplied by the number of popular votes the minor party received in the preceding general election for governor and then divided by the average number of votes the major parties received in that general election for governor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A minor political party nominee not eligible under subsection (2) but who receives more than 5% of the vote in that general election for governor is entitled to reimbursement from the state campaign fund in an amount of not more than $1,125,000.00, multiplied by the number of popular votes the minor party received in the preceding general election for governor and then divided by the average number of votes the major parties received in that general election for governor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A minor political party nominee qualified under subsection (2) who receives more popular votes in an election than the candidate of that minor political party received at the preceding election is entitled to additional reimbursement from the state campaign fund in an amount determined as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Compute the amount that the candidate would have received under subsection (3) had the candidate otherwise qualified.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Subtract the amount received under subsection (2) from the amount computed under subdivision (a).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A candidate listed on the ballot in the general election is entitled to $1.00 for each $1.00 of qualifying contributions certified to the secretary of state pursuant to this act up to $750,000.00, if the candidate has certified to the secretary of state $75,000.00 or more in qualifying contributions. A candidate who chooses to receive any public funds under this subsection shall not receive any money under subsection (1), (2), (3), or (4).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A major political party nominee shall receive from the state treasurer $56,250.00 of the funds that the candidate may be entitled to under this section not later than 10 days after the primary election, unless there is less than a 2% difference in vote totals of the top 2 primary election candidates of the same political party according to unofficial vote totals available to the secretary of state. The balance of any funds owed to a major political party nominee under this section shall be payable by the state treasurer within 3 days after the board of state canvassers' certification of the primary election results, but not later than 30 days after the primary election. Any funds paid to a major political party nominee under this section either erroneously or based on election results that are reversed due to a recount or fraud shall be repaid by that major political party nominee to the state treasurer within 60 days of receipt of notification by certified mail from the state treasurer.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) As soon as practicable, but not later than 5 business days after a report required to be filed under this act is received, make the report or all of the contents of the report available without charge to the public on a separate webpage or its website homepage.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) There is no private right of action, either in law or in equity, under this act. The remedies provided in this act are the exclusive means by which this act may be enforced and by which any harm resulting from a violation of this act may be redressed.</div>
