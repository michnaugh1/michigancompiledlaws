<P>Sec. 2.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Villages may be incorporated or territory detached therefrom or added thereto, or consolidation made of 2 or more villages into 1 village by proceedings originating by petition therefor signed by qualified electors residing within the cities, villages, or townships to be affected thereby, to a number not less than 1% of the population of the territory affected thereby according to the last preceding United States census, which number shall in no case be less than 100. If all or any part of the district proposed to be incorporated, annexed, or detached has been subdivided into 1 or more subdivisions, the plat or plats of which have been recorded in the register of deeds' office of the proper county, the petition therefor shall be signed by qualified electors residing within each such subdivision and by qualified electors residing within the unsubdivided portion, if any, of such district to a number in each case of not less than 1% of the population of each such subdivision and of such unsubdivided portion of such district, such population to be determined as of the date on which the first signature to such petition shall be obtained. If there are no qualified electors residing within the district proposed to be annexed or detached, or within a subdivided or unsubdivided portion of such a district then such petition shall be signed by persons who collectively hold equitable title as vendees under a recorded land contract or memorandum of land contract, or record legal title to more than 1/2 the area of the land, exclusive of streets, lying within such district, or subdivided portion of such district, at the time the first signature to such petition is obtained, and also by qualified electors in the remainder of the district to be affected by such annexation or detachment, to the number hereinbefore provided. If a summer resort association has been incorporated and has existed for 2 consecutive years under Act No. 230 of the Public Acts of 1897, as amended, being sections 455.1 to 455.24 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, and such association having a number of legal voters of not less than 30 residing within such territory, the same may be incorporated as a village as hereinafter provided. Signatures of land owners as above provided shall be followed by a description of the land and area thereof. In proceedings for the incorporation of a new village or the consolidation of 2 or more villages into 1 village, a petition signed by not less than 20 qualified electors who are freeholders residing within the territory proposed to be incorporated or consolidated, praying for the taking of a census of the inhabitants of the territory affected thereby, may be filed with the county clerk of the county in which the territory is located. The county clerk within 5 days after the filing of the petition shall certify to the president of each village and supervisor of each township affected thereby, and to the secretary of state, that the petition has been so filed. Within 5 days after the service of the certificate, the secretary of state shall appoint enumerators to enumerate the inhabitants of each village proposed to be incorporated, or a consolidation made thereof. Before entering upon the duties of office, each enumerator shall take and subscribe to the constitutional oath of office before some officer authorized to administer oaths and file the same with the secretary of state and with the county clerk in which the territory is located. Each enumerator shall enumerate all of the bona fide inhabitants of the village or township, territory or portion thereof assigned to the enumerator by the secretary of state, and shall visit each house or dwelling and obtain the names of each known resident thereof. Each enumerator shall receive for his or her services not to exceed $5.00 per day, together with actual and necessary expenses therefor, which sum shall be paid by the village or township within which the services of the enumerator were rendered. Upon completing the enumeration it shall be the duty of the persons so appointed to make a return in duplicate of the enumeration showing the names of the inhabitants of each village or township, territory or district to the county clerk and to the secretary of state. No enumeration or census shall be conducted in any village or township, or portion thereof, within 2 years of the date of the last enumeration in the territory. Every enumeration shall be conducted under the general supervision and control of the secretary of state who shall make rules and regulations in accordance with the the administrative procedures act of 1969, Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, being sections 24.201 to 24.315 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, for the purpose of carrying out this section. If a petition is signed by land owners in the case of a district which is proposed to be annexed or detached in which there are no qualified electors residing, as above provided, then a sworn statement shall also accompany such petition giving the total area of the land, exclusive of streets, included within such uninhabited district to be annexed or detached, or such subdivided or unsubdivided portion thereof. The term "qualified electors" as used in this section as applied to persons residing within unsubdivided portions of the district shall include only such electors who are owners of property assessed for taxes within the unsubdivided portions of the district.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In the absence of such federal census, an official special census shall be taken of that part of the areas of each township which form the newly incorporated village and of the balance of the area of such township or townships. Such census shall be taken by enumerators appointed by the secretary of state upon application by any one of the municipalities affected by such incorporation, which census shall be taken, as near as may be, in accordance with the provisions of section 6 of Act No. 279 of the Public Acts of 1909, as amended, the ratio of population between the areas incorporated from each township to form the newly incorporated village and the remainder of the respective township or townships from which the village was incorporated, shall be the basis for determination of the pro rata share of the state funds, moneys or grants to be distributed, and the township or townships from which such incorporated village is incorporated or the county agency receiving the funds, moneys or grants in respect of population in such township or townships shall be liable to the incorporated village for its proper pro rata share of any state funds, moneys or grants received by such township or townships or such county agency, respectively, after the date of incorporation;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In the absence of a federal census and in lieu of an official special census determining the respective populations of the municipalities affected by such incorporation, the newly incorporated village and each township from which the same was incorporated, may agree, by joint resolution, as to the prorating between them and between the village and any county agency receiving state funds, moneys or grants in respect of population in such township or townships of any funds, moneys, or grants distributable by the state, a certified copy of which joint resolution shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state and shall be binding upon all parties affected by said incorporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whenever a part of a city, village or township is annexed to a village, the village to which such territory is annexed shall be entitled to its proper pro rata share of any of the said state funds, moneys or grants thereafter distributable under the law to the city, village or township from which said territory was detached or to any county agency receiving state funds, moneys or grants in respect of population in such township or townships, determined as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   According to ratio of population between the area annexed and the remainder of the township, city or village from which said area was detached, as determined by the last official federal or state census showing such populations;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If there be no official census by which said respective populations can be determined, then a census shall be taken of the territory detached and the remainder of the territory in the township, city or village from which it was detached as provided above in the case of a newly incorporated village;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In the absence of a federal census and in lieu of taking an official special census, the village to which said territory was annexed and the cities, townships, or villages from which said territory was detached, may agree by joint resolution of their governing bodies as to the prorating of any such state funds, moneys, or grants between them and between the village and any county agency receiving said funds, moneys, or grants in respect of population in such township or townships as provided above in the case of a newly incorporated village, a copy of which agreement shall be filed with the secretary of state and shall thereafter be binding upon all parties to said incorporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The foregoing provisions shall be used hereafter in determining the prorata distributions of any state funds, moneys or grants between townships and/or county agencies and any village which has become newly incorporated since the last decennial federal census, either before or after the passing of this law, and between townships and/or county agencies and any village which has annexed territory since the last decennial federal census, either before or after the passing of this law; but in no event shall the sharing of any distribution of state funds, moneys, or grants made previous to the effective date of this law be altered.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The indebtedness and liabilities of every city, village, and township, a part of which shall be annexed to a village, shall be assumed by the village to which the same is annexed in the same proportion which the assessed valuation of the taxable property in the territory annexed bears to the assessed valuation of the taxable property in the entire city, village or township from which such territory is taken. Assessed valuations shall be determined in every division pursuant to this section from the last assessment roll of the city, village or township which has been confirmed by the board of review.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The governing body of a village may provide by resolution for the acquisition or financing of energy conservation improvements to be made to village facilities or infrastructure and may pay for the improvements or the financing or refunding of the improvements from operating funds of the village or from the savings that result from the energy conservation improvements. Energy conservation improvements may include, but are not limited to, heating, ventilating, or air-conditioning system improvements, fenestration improvements, roof improvements, the installation of any insulation, the installation or repair of heating, ventilating, or air-conditioning controls, and entrance or exit way closures, information technology improvements associated with an energy conservation improvement, and municipal utility improvements associated with an energy conservation improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The governing body of a village may acquire, finance, or refund 1 or more of the energy conservation improvements described in subsection (1) by installment contract, which may include a lease-purchase agreement described in subsection (5), or may borrow money and issue notes for the purpose of securing funds for the improvements or may enter into contracts in which the cost of the energy conservation improvements is paid from a portion of the savings that result from the energy conservation improvements. These contractual agreements may provide that the cost of the energy conservation improvements are paid only if the energy savings are sufficient to cover their cost. An installment contract, a lease-purchase agreement described in subsection (5), or notes issued pursuant to this subsection shall extend for a period of time not to exceed 20 years from the date of the final completion of the energy conservation improvements or the useful life of the aggregate energy conservation improvements, whichever is less. Notes issued pursuant to this subsection shall be full faith and credit, tax limited obligations of the village, payable from tax levies and the general fund as pledged by the governing body of the village. The notes are subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821. A lease-purchase agreement issued pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821, and shall not be a municipal security or a debt as those terms are defined in that act. This subsection does not limit in any manner the borrowing or bonding authority of a village as provided by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Prior to entering into a contract for energy conservation improvements under this section, the governing body of a village shall determine the following information and, within 60 days of the completion of the improvements, shall report the following information to the department of treasury: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Name of each facility to which an improvement is made and a description of the energy conservation improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Actual energy consumption during the 12-month period before commencement of the improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Project costs and expenditures, including the total of all lease payments over the duration of the lease-purchase agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Estimated annual energy savings, including projected savings over the duration of the installment contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If energy conservation improvements are made as provided in this section, the governing body of a village shall report to the department of treasury, by July 1 of each of the 5 years after the improvements are completed, only the actual annual energy consumption of each facility to which improvements are made. The forms for the reports required by this section shall be furnished by the department of treasury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An installment contract described in this section may include a lease-purchase agreement, which may be a multiyear contractual obligation that provides for automatic renewal unless positive action is taken by the legislative body to terminate that contract. Payments under a lease-purchase agreement shall be a current operating expense subject to annual appropriations of funds by the legislative body and shall obligate the legislative body only for those sums payable during the fiscal year of contract execution or any renewal year thereafter. The legislative body may make payments under a lease-purchase agreement from any legally available funds or from a combination of energy or operational savings, capital contributions, future replacement costs avoided, or billable revenue enhancements that result from energy conservation improvements, provided that the legislative body has determined that those funds are sufficient to cover, in aggregate over the full term of the contractual agreement, the cost of the energy conservation improvements. The lease-purchase agreement will terminate immediately and absolutely and without further obligation on the part of the legislative body at the close of the fiscal year in which it was executed or renewed or at such time as appropriated and otherwise unobligated funds are no longer available to satisfy the obligations of the legislative body under the lease-purchase agreement. During the term of the lease-purchase agreement, the legislative body shall be the vested owner of the energy conservation improvements and may grant a security interest in the energy conservation improvements to the provider of the lease-purchase agreement. Upon the termination of the lease-purchase agreement and the satisfaction of the obligations of the legislative body, the provider of the lease-purchase agreement shall release its security interest in the energy conservation improvements.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Adopt a charter or amendment to a charter, unless approved by a majority of the electors voting on the charter or amendment at a general or special election.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Authorize an issue of bonds unless approved at an election by a majority of the electors of the village voting on the issuance of the bonds. This subdivision does not apply to special assessment bonds, bonds for the village portion of local improvements, not to exceed 40% of the cost of the improvement, refunding bonds, bonds for relief from fire, flood, or calamity, or for payment of judgments, or bonds that the legislative body is authorized by specific statute to issue without vote of the electors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Adopt a scheme for exemption from municipal taxation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Repudiate a debt by a change in its charter or by consolidation with any other municipality.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Incur indebtedness by the issue of bonds, or otherwise, in a sum that, including existing indebtedness, exceeds 10% of the assessed valuation of the real and personal property within the village subject to taxation, as shown by the last assessment roll of the village. Bonds issued in anticipation of the collection of special assessments, even though they are a general obligation of the village, motor vehicle highway fund bonds, revenue bonds, and bonds issued, or contract or assessment obligations incurred, to comply with an order of the department of environmental quality or a court of competent jurisdiction, even though they are a general obligation of the village, bonds issued, or contract or assessment obligations incurred, for water supply, sewerage, drainage, or refuse disposal projects necessary to protect the public health by abating pollution, even though they are a general obligation of the village, and bonds issued or assessments or contract obligations incurred for the construction, improvement, or replacement of a combined sewer overflow abatement facility are not included in this limitation. Money on hand in a sinking fund limited to the payment of indebtedness may be treated as a reduction of the indebtedness to that extent. If, because of fire, flood, or other calamity, an emergency fund is required for the relief of the inhabitants of the village or for the repairing or rebuilding of any of its municipal buildings, works, bridges, or streets, the legislative body of the village may borrow money due in not more than 3 years and in an amount not exceeding 1/4 of 1% of the assessed valuation of the village, notwithstanding that the loan may increase the indebtedness of the village beyond the limitations fixed by its charter or in this subdivision. If a village is authorized to acquire or operate a public utility, it may issue mortgage bonds for that purpose beyond the general limit of bonded indebtedness prescribed by law. The mortgage bonds issued beyond the limit of general indebtedness prescribed by law must not impose a liability upon the village, but must be secured only upon the property and revenues of the public utility, including a franchise, stating the terms upon which, in case of foreclosure, the purchaser may operate the public utility. The franchise must not extend for a period longer than 20 years from the date of the sale of the public utility and franchise on foreclosure. Bonds issued, or contract or assessment obligations incurred, before July 31, 1973 are validated. As used in this subdivision:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Issue bonds without creating a sinking fund for the payment of the bonds, except special assessment bonds that are a charge upon a special district created for the payment of the bonds, and serial bonds payable annually.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In computing the net indebtedness for the purposes of subsection (1)(h), there may be added to the assessed value of real and personal property in a village for a fiscal year an amount equal to the assessed value equivalent of certain village revenues as determined under this subsection. The assessed value equivalent must be calculated by dividing the sum of the following amounts by the village's millage rate for the fiscal year:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The amount paid or the estimated amount required to be paid by the state to the village during the village's fiscal year for the village's use under the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921, and the amount of any eligible reimbursement to the village under the local community stabilization authority act, 2014 PA 86, MCL 123.1341 to 123.1362, except any amount distributed under section 17(4)(c) of the local community stabilization authority act, 2014 PA 86, MCL 123.1357, in excess of the village's qualified loss.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Beginning on September 13, 2011, a village shall not adopt a village charter or ordinance that includes any minimum staffing requirement for village employees. Any provision in a village charter or ordinance adopted on or after September 13, 2011 that contains a minimum staffing requirement for village employees is void and unenforceable.</div>
