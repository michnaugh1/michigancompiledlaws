<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The commissioner shall not issue a license to a person to engage in business exclusively as a lottery sales agent. Before issuing a lottery sales license, the commissioner shall consider factors such as the financial responsibility and security of the person and his or her business or activity, the accessibility of his or her place of business or activity to the public, the sufficiency of existing licenses to serve the public convenience, and the volume of expected sales.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The commissioner shall issue an initial or renewal lottery sales license not later than 90 days after the applicant files a completed application. Receipt of the application is considered the date the application is received by any agency or department of this state. If the commissioner determines that the application is incomplete, the commissioner shall notify the applicant in writing, or make information electronically available, within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The 90-day period is tolled upon notification by the commissioner of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the commissioner. The determination of the completeness of an application does not operate as an approval of the application for the license and does not confer eligibility of an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the commissioner fails to issue or deny a lottery sales license within the time required by this section, the commissioner shall return the license fee and shall reduce the license fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. The failure to issue a lottery sales license within the time required under this section does not allow the commissioner to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and that application, upon completion, shall be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The commissioner shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based upon the fact that the license fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The commissioner shall submit a report by December 1 of each year to the standing committees and appropriations subcommittees of the senate and house of representatives concerned with gaming issues. The commissioner shall include all of the following information in the report concerning the preceding fiscal year:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The number of initial and renewal applications the commissioner received and completed within the 90-day time period described in subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The number of applications denied.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The number of applicants not issued a license within the 90-day time period and the amount of money returned to licensees and applicants under subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person licensed as a lottery sales agent may sell lottery tickets and shares. A person lawfully engaged in nongovernmental business on state property may be licensed as a lottery sales agent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A lottery sales license is not assignable or transferable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A licensed agent or his or her employee may sell lottery tickets or shares only on the premises stated in the lottery sales license. A licensed agent who violates this subsection is, at the commissioner's discretion, subject to 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Probation for not more than 2 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A fine of not more than $1,000.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Removal of his or her lottery terminal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The commissioner may require a bond from a licensed agent in an amount provided in rules promulgated under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A licensed agent shall display his or her license or a copy of the license conspicuously in accordance with rules promulgated under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The commissioner may suspend or revoke the license of an agent who violates this act or a rule promulgated under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) For purposes of terminal placement, the commissioner shall take into account with equal emphasis both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The total instant game sales for the 3 months immediately preceding a market evaluation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The need to maximize net lottery revenues from the total number of terminals placed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A licensed lottery sales agent shall not offer to give or give any money or other thing of value to the holder of a lottery ticket or share for winning the lottery, other than the prize if payment of the prize by the agent is authorized by the commissioner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Completed application" means an application complete on its face and submitted with any applicable licensing fees and any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Person" means an individual, association, corporation, club, trust, estate, society, company, joint stock company, receiver, trustee, referee, or other person acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity who is appointed by a court, or any combination of individuals. Person includes a department, commission, agency, or instrumentality of the state, including a county, city, village, or township and an agency or instrumentality of the county, city, village, or township.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 25.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)     The bureau shall give a prizewinner in the Michigan lotto game the option of receiving his or her prize in a single payment or in installments. This option shall be made available to and exercised by the purchaser of a Michigan lotto game ticket at the point of purchase. As used in this subsection, "Michigan lotto game" means a game administered by the bureau in which the matrix is 6 out of 49 numbers drawn.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The right of any person to a prize drawn from the state lottery is not assignable, except as provided in this section. The commissioner shall be discharged of all further liability upon payment of a prize pursuant to this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Payment of any prize drawn may be made to a person pursuant to an appropriate judicial order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Payment of any prize drawn may be made to the state pursuant to section 32.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a prizewinner dies before collecting the full amount of his or her prize drawn from the state lottery, the bureau shall continue to make the remaining prize payments to the prizewinner's surviving spouse and the prizewinner's living children, in equal proportions, unless otherwise directed by the prizewinner. If there is not a surviving spouse or living children or other designated beneficiaries, the remaining prize payments shall be made to the prizewinner's estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Except as provided in subsection (11), payment of any prize drawn may be made to any person pursuant to a voluntary assignment of the right to receive future prize payments, in whole or in part, if the assignment is made to a person or entity designated pursuant to an appropriate judicial order of a court of competent jurisdiction located in either the county in which the assignor resides or the county in which the bureau is located. An order approving the assignment and directing the commissioner to pay the assignee all or a part of future prize payments is properly issued if the court finds that all of the following circumstances exist:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The assignment is in writing, executed by the assignor in accordance with the laws of this state, and the terms of the assignment are disclosed, including the identity of the assignee, the portion or portions of prize payments to be assigned, and the amounts and dates of any payments that shall be given in exchange for the assignment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The assignor provides a sworn affidavit to the court attesting that the assignor is of sound mind, is not acting under duress, has been advised regarding the assignment by his or her legal counsel, and understands and agrees that the state and the commissioner will have no further liability or responsibility to make prize payments to the assignor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The proposed assignment does not include or cover payments or portions of payments that are subject to section 32.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Not less than 5 days after filing a petition for a judicial order that approves a voluntary assignment under this subsection and not less than 10 days before a hearing on the petition, the petitioner shall cause a copy of the petition and notice of hearing on the petition to be served upon the attorney general.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Soliciting or offering rights to lottery prize payments, either by assignment or through pledge as collateral for a loan, shall not be considered selling or offering for sale lottery tickets or shares under this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The commissioner is authorized to establish a reasonable fee to defray the cost of any administrative expenses associated with assignments made pursuant to this section, including the cost of a processing fee that may be imposed by a private annuity provider. The amount of the fee shall reflect the direct and indirect costs associated with processing the assignments.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   Except as otherwise provided by state or federal law, the commissioner or an officer or employee of the bureau shall not disclose the name, address, or any other personal information concerning a winner of a prize greater than $10,000.00 drawn from the state lottery, unless the winner of a prize agrees in writing to allow the disclosure. Subject to subsection (10), the information protected against disclosure under this section is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   Notwithstanding subsection (9), the commissioner or an officer or employee of the bureau may disclose the name, address, or any other personal information concerning a winner of a prize awarded under a game played pursuant to a joint enterprise to the extent required under the joint enterprise participation agreement executed by the commissioner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   If at any time the federal internal revenue service or a court of competent jurisdiction issues a determination letter, revenue ruling, other public ruling of the internal revenue service, or published decision to any state lottery or state lottery prizewinner declaring that the voluntary assignment of prizes will affect the federal income tax treatment of prizewinners who do not assign their prizes, the commissioner shall immediately file a copy of that letter, ruling, or published decision with the secretary of state and the office of the state court administrator. A court shall not issue a voluntary assignment order under subsection (6) after the date the ruling, letter, or published decision is filed.</DIV>

Am. 2021, Act 92, Imd. Eff. Oct. 29, 2021 <BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> Act 118 of 1994, which was approved by the governor and filed with the secretary of state on May 12, 1994, provided for the amendment of Secs. 3 and 7a of Act 382 of 1972, known as the Traxler-McCauley-Law-Bowman Bingo Act, such amendments to be effective April 1, 1995. On January 31, 1995, a petition seeking a referendum on Act 118 of 1994 was filed with the secretary of state. Const 1963, art 2, sec 9, provides that no law as to which the power of referendum properly has been invoked shall be effective thereafter unless approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon at the next general election. A referendum on Act 118 of 1994 was presented to the electors at the November 1996 general election as Proposal A, which read as follows:“Public Act 118 of 1994 would:1) Change the definition of a qualified organization which is permitted to sponsor certain forms of gaming, including bingo, millionaire parties, and raffles, so that an organization which is organized under the Michigan Campaign Finance Act, including a candidate committee, political committee, political party committee, ballot question committee, or independent committee, is no longer qualified to receive a license to sponsor such gaming.2) Permit a change in the single maximum prize or payout for a charity game sold by a licensed religious, educational, service, senior citizens, fraternal or veterans organization.Should this law be approved?Yes [  ]No [  ]”Act 118 of 1994 was rejected by a majority of the electors voting thereon at the November 1996 general election.Act 275 of 1995, which was approved by the governor on January 7, 1996, and filed with the secretary of state on January 8, 1996, provided for the amendment of Sec. 3 of Act 382 of 1972, as amended by Act 118 of 1994.In Reynolds v Martin, 240 Mich App 84, 610 NW2d 597 (No. 210973)(2000), the Court of Appeals stated that the primary question raised in this appeal from the Barry County Circuit Court's decision granting declaratory relief to defendants is whether, under the constitutional provisions governing referendums, “the Legislature was without authority to pass 1995 PA 275 and thus reenact the provisions of 1994 PA 118, which was then subject to a referendum effort.” The court concluded “that the Legislature had this authority and that, in exercising it, the Legislature did not undermine the referendum authority granted to the people by our constitution.”For transfer of the Bureau of State Lottery from the Department of Management and Budget to be an autonomous entity within the Department of Treasury, see E.R.O.

If more than 3 applicants meet the standards for eligibility and suitability provided for in subsections (4) and (5), the board shall first issue licenses to those eligible and suitable applicants that submitted any casino gaming proposal for voter approval before January 1, 1995, in the city in which the casino will be located and the voters approved the proposal. </div>

For a period during which the licensee is paying the city's share of the tax under this subsection directly to the city under either of the methods in subsection (4), the payment to the state casino gaming fund under this subsection is 4% and must be allocated 7/8 to the general fund and 1/8 to the Michigan agriculture equine industry development fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Subject to subsections (7) and (8), and unless an act of God, a war, a disaster, or an act of terrorism directly and substantially impacts the ability of a casino licensee to complete construction of its casino and casino enterprise, if a casino licensee is not fully operational by each of the following dates, the tax on the casino licensee under subsection (5) is as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) July 1, 2009, 7%, allocated 1/2 to the general fund, 1/14 to the Michigan agriculture equine industry development fund, and 3/7 to the city in which the licensee's casino is located.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) July 1, 2011, 9%, allocated 7/18 to the general fund, 1/18 to the Michigan agriculture equine industry development fund, and 5/9 to the city in which the licensee's casino is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Subject to subsection (8), and irrespective of whether there has been an increase under subsection (6), after a casino licensee has been fully operational for 30 consecutive days, the casino licensee may apply to the board for certification under this subsection. If the board determines that a casino licensee that makes an application under this subsection has been fully operational and in compliance with its development agreement that is in existence on July 1, 2004 or a subsequent original development agreement, for at least 30 consecutive days, the board shall certify the casino licensee under this subsection, and the tax imposed on the casino licensee under subsection (5), as adjusted, if applicable, by subsection (6), shall be, retroactive to the first day of the 30 consecutive day period that the casino licensee was fully operational, reduced to 1% and must be allocated entirely to the city where the licensee operates its casino.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the McCauley-Traxler-Law-Bowman-McNeely lottery act, 1972 PA 239, MCL 432.1 to 432.47, is amended to allow the operation of video lottery at horse racetracks in this state, and if video lottery is being conducted at horse racetracks in this state, the casino licensee is no longer obligated to pay the wagering tax under subsections (5) to (7).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Notwithstanding section 9b, if the McCauley-Traxler-Law-Bowman-McNeely lottery act, 1972 PA 239, MCL 432.1 to 432.47, is amended to allow the operation of video lottery at horse racetracks in this state, and if video lottery is being conducted at horse racetracks in this state, a casino licensee may, after obtaining approval from the board, apply to the racing commissioner for authorization to simulcast horse races under the horse racing law of 1995, 1995 PA 279, MCL 431.301 to 431.336. A casino licensee that is authorized under this subsection shall comply with all applicable provisions of the horse racing law of 1995, 1995 PA 279, MCL 431.301 to 431.336, rules promulgated under that act, and the written permit to conduct simulcasting and any related order issued to the casino licensee by the racing commissioner. Simulcasting and wagering under this subsection are under the primary control of the racing commissioner, and the racing commissioner may revoke or suspend the authorization of or take other disciplinary action against the casino licensee for failing to comply with a law, rule, permit, or order as required by this subsection. However, the simulcasting and wagering under this subsection is part of the licensee's casino operation under this act and subject to the same control by the board as are other parts of the licensee's casino operation. The board may take disciplinary action under section 4a against a casino licensee for failure to comply with a law, rule, permit, or order as required by this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A casino licensee is entitled to the same commission from money wagered on horse races simulcast by the licensee as a race meeting licensee is entitled to receive from wagering on simulcast horse races under the horse racing law of 1995, 1995 PA 279, MCL 431.301 to 431.336. The same taxes, fees, and other deductions must be subtracted and paid from the licensee's commission as are subtracted and paid from a race meeting licensee's commission under the horse racing law of 1995, 1995 PA 279, MCL 431.301 to 431.336.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Payments to a city under 1 of the methods in subsection (4) must be made in a manner, at those times, and subject to reporting requirements and penalties and interest for delinquent payment as may be provided for in the development agreement if the payment is required under a development agreement, or by ordinance if the payment is required for a tax levied by the city. Payments required under the method described in subsection (4)(a) may be in addition to any other payments that may be required in the development agreement for the conveyance of any interest in property, the purchase of services, or the reimbursement of expenses. Payments to a city under the method described in subsection (4) must be used by the city for the purposes listed in subsection (3)(a).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Approval by the city of a development agreement or adoption of an ordinance approving either casino gaming or the levy of a local excise tax does not constitute the granting of a franchise or license by the city for purposes of any statutory, charter, or constitutional provision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The taxes imposed under this section and any tax imposed under section 13(2) must be administered by the department of treasury in accordance with 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and this act. In case of conflict between the provisions of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and this act, the provisions of this act prevail.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) Funds from this act must not be used to supplant existing state appropriations or local expenditures.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) If internet sports betting or other forms of internet gaming are authorized and regulated by other laws of this state, any taxes, payments, and fees relating to such internet wagers received by a casino licensee and such internet gaming are subject to those other laws of this state. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (15), and in lieu of the taxes and fees that otherwise would be imposed under this act on sports betting, a wagering tax of 8.4% is imposed on the qualified adjusted gross receipts received by a casino licensee from any form of sports betting conducted under this act. Wagering taxes paid under this subsection must be allocated as provided in subsection (3). As used in this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Gross sports betting receipts" means the total of all sums, including, but not limited to, valid or invalid checks, valid or invalid credit or debit card deposits, valid or invalid ACH deposits, currency, coupons, free play or promotional credits, redeemable credits, vouchers, entry fees assessed for tournaments or other contests, or instruments of monetary value whether collected or uncollected, in each case actually wagered by a person authorized by law to participate in sports betting at or with a casino licensee on sports betting, less all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Winnings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Amounts returned to a person authorized by law to participate in sports betting due to a game, platform, or system malfunction or because the sports bet must be voided due to concerns regarding integrity of the wager or game.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Uncollectible markers or successfully disputed credit or debit card charges that were previously included in the computation of gross sports betting receipts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Qualified adjusted gross receipts" means gross sports betting receipts minus the monetary value of free play provided to and wagered by persons authorized by law to participate in sports betting as an incentive to place or as a result of their having placed sports betting wagers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) Notwithstanding subsection (15), if a casino licensee provides a wagerer with a device to conduct internet gaming while at the casino, the taxes otherwise provided for under subsections (1) to (14), not to exceed 19%, are imposed on the adjusted gross receipts received by the casino licensee from the wagerer's internet gaming on the device. This subsection does not apply to sports betting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) A casino licensee shall provide to the board a monthly report to include all of the following regarding its gaming operations under this act by game category, such as slots, poker and table games, and sports betting by sport:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Total amount of wagers received.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Winnings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Free play redeemed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Deductions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Adjusted gross receipts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) The board shall provide the report under subsection (18) to the department and state budget office on request. In addition, the department and the state budget office may request additional information from the casino licensees that is directly related to, and for the purposes of verification of, the financial data provided under subsection (18)(a) and (b), which must be provided within 60 days after the request. All information provided under this section is confidential and proprietary and is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) This section does not impair the contractual rights under an existing development agreement between a city and a casino licensee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Fully operational" means that a certificate of occupancy has been issued to the casino licensee for the operation of a hotel with not fewer than 400 guest rooms and, after issuance of the certificate of occupancy, the casino licensee's casino, casino enterprise, and 400-guest-room hotel have been opened and made available for public use at their permanent location and maintained in that status.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Michigan agriculture equine industry development fund" means the Michigan agriculture equine industry development fund created in section 20 of the horse racing law of 1995, 1995 PA 279, MCL 431.320.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 24.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, when the board revokes a casino license, or suspends a casino license for a period in excess of 120 days, or refuses to renew a casino license, whether or not an appeal is pending, the board, with notice to the mayor of the city in which the casino is located, shall appoint a conservator to, among other things, take into his or her possession and control all the property and business of the licensee relating to the casino. However, this subsection shall not apply in any instance in which the casino for which the casino license had been issued has not been in operation and open to the public. A person shall not be appointed as conservator unless the board is satisfied that he or she is qualified.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The board may proceed in a conservatorship action in a summary manner and shall have the power to appoint and remove 1 or more conservators and to enjoin the former or suspended licensee from exercising any of its privileges from collecting any debts and from selling, assigning, or transferring any of its property to a person other than a conservator, except as the board may order. The board shall have the further powers necessary for fulfilling the purposes of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Every conservator shall, before assuming his or her duties, execute and file a bond for the faithful performance of his or her duties payable to the board in the office of the board with the surety or sureties and in the form that the board shall approve and in the amount prescribed by the board.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   When more than 1 conservator is appointed pursuant to this section, each conservator is subject to this act. Each conservator may collect the debts and property of the former or suspended licensee. The powers and rights conferred upon the conservators shall be exercised only when a majority of the conservators have agreed to the proposed action.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Upon his or her appointment, the conservator shall become vested with the title of all the property of the former or suspended licensee relating to the casino. Subject to any and all valid liens, claims, and encumbrances, the conservator shall have the duty to conserve and preserve the assets to ensure that the assets shall continue to be operated on a sound and businesslike basis.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Subject to the general supervision of the board and pursuant to any specific order it may consider appropriate, a conservator shall have power to do all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Take into his or her possession all the property of the former or suspended licensee relating to the casino and the approved hotel, including its books, records, and papers. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Institute and defend actions by or on behalf of the former or suspended licensee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Settle or compromise with any debtor or creditor of the former or suspended licensee, including any taxing authority.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Continue the business of the former or suspended licensee including entering into contracts, borrowing money, and pledging, mortgaging, or otherwise encumbering the property of the former or suspended licensee as security for the repayment of the conservator's loans. However, the power shall be subject to any provisions and restrictions in any existing credit documents.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Hire, fire, and discipline employees.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Review all outstanding agreements to which the former or suspended licensee is a party that fall within the purview of this act and advise the board on which, if any, of the agreements should be the subject of scrutiny, examination, or investigation by the board.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Do all acts that best fulfill the purposes of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (8), the conservator shall sell, assign, or otherwise transfer ownership of all of the property, in bulk, of a former licensee that was part of the casino or an approved hotel to a person who meets all of the requirements of this act and rules promulgated under this act to receive a casino license under this act subject to all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Prior approval of the board with the consent of the mayor of the city in which the casino is located. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Prior consultation with the former licensee about the reasonableness of the terms and conditions of the sale, assignment, or transfer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Prior written notice to all creditors and other persons required to be notified pursuant to court rule or statute.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The conservator shall not conduct a sale, assignment, or transfer under subsection (7) under any of the following circumstances:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A suspension of the casino license is pending.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   An appeal from an action that precipitated the conservatorship is pending.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The board has not approved a sale, assignment, or transfer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   Upon the request of the conservator, prior to a sale, assignment, or transfer under subsection (7), the board shall conduct a summary review of the proposed sale, assignment, or transfer of ownership. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   The board may direct that the conservator retain the property and continue the business of the former or suspended licensee relating to the casino and the approved hotel for an indefinite period of time. Without being personally liable, during any period of operation by the conservator, the conservator shall pay when due all secured obligations. The conservator is not immune from foreclosure or other legal proceedings to collect the secured debt. The conservator shall have all of the legal rights, claims, or defenses that would have been available to the former or suspended licensee. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   In a proceeding described in subsection (10), the board shall allow a reasonable compensation for the services, costs, and expenses for the conservator, the attorney for the conservator, the appraiser, the auctioneer, the accountant, and the other persons as the board may appoint in connection with the conservatorship.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   As an incident of its prior approval of the sale, assignment, or other transfer, in bulk, of all property of the former licensee that was a part of the casino, the board may require that the purchaser of the property assume in a form acceptable to the board all of the outstanding debts of the former licensee that arise from or were based upon the operation of the casino.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   The conservator shall not make a payment of net earnings during the period of the conservatorship without the prior approval of the board, which may direct that all or any part of the net earnings be paid to the suspended or former licensee or to the state casino gaming fund or the state services fee fund or to the city as a municipal services fee or tax or municipal wagering tax, in accordance with rules promulgated by the board. The former or suspended licensee is entitled to a fair rate of return out of net earnings, if any, during the period of the conservatorship on the property retained by the conservator.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(14)   Following any sale, assignment, or other transfer, in bulk, of all the property subject to the conservatorship, the conservator shall pay the net proceeds from the sale that remain after payment of all obligations owing to the state of Michigan and any political subdivisions of the state and of those allowances set forth in this act to the former or suspended licensee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(15)   A conservator appointed pursuant to this act shall at all times be subject to this act and the rules, limitations, restrictions, terms, and conditions as the board may prescribe. Except as otherwise provided in this act, during the period of any conservatorship imposed by this act, the casino operation in the form of the conservatorship shall be considered a licensed casino operation subject to this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(16)   The board shall direct the discontinuation of a conservatorship when the conservator has, with the prior approval of the board, consummated the sale, assignment, or other transfer, in bulk, of all of the property of the former licensee that was part of the casino.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(17)   The board may direct the discontinuation of any conservatorship when it determines that the reason for which the action was instituted no longer exists.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(18)   Upon the discontinuation of the conservatorship and with the approval of the board, the conservator shall take the steps necessary to effect an orderly transfer of the property of the former or suspended licensee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(19)   The sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, or other disposition of the securities issued by a former or suspended licensee during the pendency of a conservatorship instituted pursuant to this act does not divest or otherwise affect the powers conferred upon a conservator by this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(20)   A conservator appointed pursuant to this act shall file with the board reports on the administration of the conservatorship in the form and at the intervals the board shall prescribe. Such reports shall be available for examination and inspection by any creditor or party in interest and, in addition, the board may direct that copies of the reports be mailed to designated creditors or other persons and that summaries of any reports be published in designated newspapers of general circulation. </DIV>
