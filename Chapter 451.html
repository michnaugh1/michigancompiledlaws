<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   It shall be unlawful for any person to act as a member of a protective committee, as a depositary or as a solicitor in this state for the purpose of procuring the modification and/or amendment and/or foreclosure of any instrument in writing securing any issue of bonds, notes, debentures and all other similar evidences of indebtedness without first procuring a license and continuing to be licensed therefor. Any person desiring a license either as a member of a protective committee, as a depositary, or as a solicitor shall apply therefor to the commission upon application forms to be furnished by the commission. Such application shall, in the event that the applicant is a natural person, set forth the name, age, residence, business address, principal occupation and antecedent business experience of the applicant, the name of the security with respect to which the applicant desires to act, and such other facts as the commission shall require. In the event that the applicant is a non-natural person the application shall set forth such pertinent information as the commission may require including information and facts concerning the applicant's principal officers or members similar to those required of natural persons.

In case the payment of such respective license fees is deferred as above provided, such fees shall be a lien on the securities deposited. If the commission should conclude that a license should not issue, the application may be denied: Provided, That no order of denial shall be entered until the applicant has been given a hearing on the reasons for such denial.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In case any protective committee or depositary which is in existence at the time this act shall take effect, shall fail to function, the commission, in its discretion, may grant to the protective committee or depositary whose application covering the same issue of securities has been granted under the provisions of this act, power to function as and in lieu of such inactive protective committee or depositary or the commission may designate a person or persons to act as a protective committee and/or the commission may designate a person or persons to act as a depositary under the provisions of this act, and/or the commission may designate a person or persons to act as conservator of the deposit agreement of the inactive protective committee and/or the deposited securities pledged or remaining or deposited under the emergency clause of this act. In all cases of inactive or delinquent protective committees or inactive or delinquent depositaries the commission shall have power to summon and compel such committees and/or depositaries to appear at a hearing before said commission, by giving 3 days notice to such inactive or delinquent committee and/or depositary. At such hearing, the commission shall take proofs and hear evidence as to the delinquency and/or inactivity complained of.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Before said commission shall authorize a protective committee which is organized after this act goes into effect to solicit, either through its members or its employes, the deposit of securities and/or the consent of holders or owners of securities, it shall cause notice to be served by registered mail upon the person or persons who executed said security, advising said person or persons that an application for permission to solicit the deposit of the particular security and/or the consent of the holders or owners to a protective committee agreement has been filed with said commission and that if there are any objections to the granting of such application written objections thereto shall be filed with the commission within 15 days from the date of the receipt of said notice. The commission is hereby authorized and empowered for good cause shown to extend the time within which such written objections may be filed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In the event that no written objections are filed with said commission by the person or persons who executed said security within 15 days from the date of the receipt of the aforesaid notice or within such further time as the commission may allow, said commission shall proceed promptly to dispose of said application.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In the event, however, that written objections are filed within proper time as aforesaid, the commission shall promptly serve notice upon the chairman and secretary of the protective committee and upon the person or persons who filed the written objections that a hearing of the matter will be had before the commission at a time and place designated by the commission. At such hearing there may be presented to the commission such testimony and evidence as bears upon the question whether the solicitation of the deposit of securities and/or the consent of holders or owners to the protective committee agreement would work a fraud, deception, or damage on the holders or owners of said security. After said hearing, the commission shall proceed promptly to dispose of said application.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upon filing in any circuit court in chancery a report of the proceedings had in relation to the sale under a decree of said court for the foreclosure of any trust mortgage given to a trustee to secure bonds issued and authenticated as therein set forth, if it shall appear from said report that no bid was made for the mortgaged property or if a bid therefor was made and it shall, in the manner hereinafter set forth, be made to appear to the court that the sum so bid does not represent the then fair and reasonable value of the interest of the holders of such bonds secured thereby, and, in either event, that no bid for a sum representing such fair and reasonable value of said interest appears to be obtainable, the court may authorize the trustee to bid for and acquire said mortgaged property as hereinafter set forth. Such authorization to bid for and acquire such property shall be made only upon written request therefor to said court by said trustee, or the holders of not less than a majority of the amount of such bonds then secured by said trust mortgage. The request by such holders may be executed by said holders in person, or by agent or attorney. Upon the filing of such request the court shall make an order requiring all interested persons to appear at a time to be designated in said order and show cause, if any, why the court should not authorize the trustee to bid for and acquire the mortgaged property as above provided. The trustee shall cause said order to be published in some newspaper designated by the court and printed in the county where such foreclosure proceedings are pending, and/or in such other newspaper as the court may direct, once in each week for 15 successive weeks prior to the return day of said order to show cause and shall mail or cause to be mailed a copy thereof to the mortgagor, to all other parties in said foreclosure proceedings and to each holder of said bonds secured by said mortgage insofar as the names of such holders are known to the trustee, at least 12 weeks prior to the date specified in said order, such notice to be mailed in each instance to the last known postoffice address. Proof of such publication and of such mailing shall be filed in said proceedings on or before the return day of said order, and proof of mailing shall be sufficient if made by affidavit of the trustee, or by an agent, employee or representative of the trustee having knowledge of the facts, merely avering [averring] that a copy of said order was so mailed. Neither the validity nor the regularity of proceedings under this act shall be affected by the fact that any mortgagor, party, holder of said bonds or interested person may not have had actual notice of said order to show cause or by the fact that a copy of said order may not have been mailed to, or, for any other reason, may not have been received by such mortgagor, party, holder of said bonds or interested person. Any interested party shall have a right to be heard and may offer testimony upon the hearing on said order to show cause. On or before the return day of said order to show cause any holder of bonds secured by said trust mortgage may file in writing a refusal to concur in such request. An order authorizing but not requiring the trustee to bid for and acquire the mortgaged property for such sum as shall, in the judgment of the court, represent the fair and reasonable value of the interests therein of the holders of the bonds may be entered if, upon said hearing, the court shall find either that no bid was made for the property offered for sale under said decree or that the sums so bid therefor did not represent the fair and reasonable value of the interests of such holders in said property and that no bid for a sum representing such fair and reasonable value of such interest appears to be obtainable: Provided, however, That no such order shall be entered where the request has been made by the trustee unless the holders of not less than a majority of the amount of such bonds then outstanding shall, prior to the entry of said order, have joined in said request, by a writing filed in said proceedings executed by said holders in person or by agent or attorney. The trustee may make said bid in open court or may file said bid in writing in said proceedings within 30 days after the entry of said order. Such bid for and acquisition of said property by said trustee shall be for and on behalf of all holders of bonds secured by said trust mortgage who shall not, in the manner herein set forth, have filed in said proceedings their written refusal to concur in the request whereon said order to show cause was entered, according to respective pro rata interests, and every holder of said bonds shall be conclusively presumed to have assented to such acquisition of said property and to the use of such bonds of such holders therefor unless such holder shall have filed such refusal to concur. Any such acquisition by the trustee shall be subject to all rights of redemption of the mortgagor and other parties. The subsequent transfer of any bond in respect of which any request, assent or action under any provision of this act shall have been made, presumed or taken shall not affect such request, assent or action. To the extent of the net amount which would have been distributable on the bonds secured by said trust mortgage if such bid were fully paid in cash, the bid shall be satisfied by a pro rata credit deemed to have been made on each such bond. The court shall make provision in said order for payment to non-concurring holders of their pro rata share of the net amount to which each of said holders shall be entitled by reason of said bid and acquisition.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The court may in its discretion provide in said order that such payment to non-concurring holders may be made in installments, or otherwise deferred for a period of time if the amount so deferred shall not exceed 25 per cent of the net amount of the bid: Provided, however, That the full pro rata to be paid said non-concurring holders hereunder shall, in any event, be made within 18 months from the entry of said order. The sum so deferred shall bear interest at the rate borne by said bonds. No personal obligation for such deferred payment shall be imposed upon the trustee but such deferred payment shall be secured upon the right, title and interest acquired by the trustee as a result of such acquisition and shall be enforced as herein provided. If payment to said non-concurring holders shall not be made as provided in said order, the court may, upon application of any non-concurring holder to whom such payment shall not have been made, order the trustee to sell the property so purchased by the trustee, or such part thereof as may be necessary, either at public or private sale after notice thereof shall have been given to all interested parties in such manner as the court shall direct, and out of the proceeds of said sale pay the sums due said non-concurring holders, the balance, if any, to belong to the beneficiaries of the trust hereafter provided for and to be held and dealt with by the trustee as the court shall direct.</DIV>

The court may provide such other terms and conditions of the trust and powers, duties and authority of the trustee, not inconsistent with the foregoing, as to the court shall be deemed to be to the interests of the beneficiaries of the trust as a whole. Upon the complete consummation of a sale or other disposition of all of the trust property the trustee shall render in writing a full and complete report and account of the administration of said trust and of the distribution of the assets, income and proceeds thereof upon which a hearing shall be had after such notice to the beneficiaries of the trust as the court shall direct. If any such trust shall continue for more than 1 year an account and report of the administration of such trust shall be rendered at such times as may be required by the court but at least annually and when any such report shall have been made the final account and report aforesaid shall be required to cover only from the date of the then last account and report.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A licensee may enter into a contract or agreement to provide debt management services to a debtor only if the licensee has conducted a written and thorough budget analysis of the debtor and made a determination, based on the analysis of the information provided by the debtor or otherwise available to the licensee, that a debt management plan is a suitable solution for the debtor and that the debtor will be able to meet the payment obligations under the plan. If the licensee determines that a plan is suitable for a debtor whose current monthly expense and debt payments exceed the debtor's net income, the licensee must establish a written plan outlining how the debtor will meet the payment obligations under the plan before entering into a contract or agreement to provide debt management services to the debtor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A budget analysis described in subsection (1) shall contain all of the following information about the debtor:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Name and address.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Number of dependents.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Amount of all employment compensation, payments from government programs, child support and alimony payments, and other income and the debtor's net monthly income.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Monthly home mortgage or rental payment, if any. If the home mortgage payment does not include an escrow for real estate taxes, the budget analysis shall contain an estimate of the annual amount of the real estate taxes on the property, if the amount is available from the debtor or public source.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Type and amount of all of the debtor's obligations included in the debt management plan, including, but not limited to, a description of and amount owed for any outstanding garnishments and judgments, and the type and amount of the debtor's obligations that are known to the debtor and are not included in the debt management plan.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A licensee shall attempt to obtain consent to participate in a debt management plan from at least 51%, in number or dollar amount, of the debtor's creditors within 90 days after establishing the debt management plan. If the required consent is not actually received by the licensee, the licensee shall provide notice to the debtor of the lack of required consent and the debtor may, at its option, close the account. If the debtor decides to close the account, any unexpended funds shall be returned to the debtor or disbursed as directed by the debtor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For purposes of subsection (2), a licensee may seek the consent of a creditor to participate in a debt management plan by sending a notice of a debt management plan to the creditor by an appropriate means including by telephone, facsimile, electronic means, or first-class mail. If the creditor does not respond within 14 days after the notice is sent, the licensee may presume that the creditor has given consent. However, this subsection does not require that a licensee send notice of a debt management plan to all of a debtor's creditors.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Any disbursements by a licensee to the debtor or to the creditors of the debtor shall be made from a trust account established under this section. A licensee shall deposit a payment from a debtor or on behalf of a debtor in the account not later than 2 business days after receiving the payment. A licensee may utilize a sweep arrangement if the trust account is insured for 100% or more of the balance in the trust account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A licensee shall reconcile a trust account established under this section at least every month. The reconciliation shall ascertain the actual cash balance in the account and compare it with the sum of the escrow balances attributable to the debtor or debtors whose funds are included in the account. The licensee may reconcile the account electronically or by any other appropriate method and shall complete the reconciliation within 45 business days after receiving the bank statement for the account. The licensee shall keep an electronic or other appropriate notation of the reconciliation as a permanent record of the licensee. The licensee shall individually schedule each debtor's trust account balance in the licensee's reconciliation records. On request, the licensee shall make the reconciliation of the total account, including the balance for each debtor whose funds are included in the account, available to the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A trust account established under this section shall at all times have an actual cash balance equal to or greater than the sum of the escrow balances of each debtor's account, and failure to maintain that amount is cause for a summary suspension of a license unless the failure is the result of an inadvertent clerical or human error.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a trust account established under this section does not contain sufficient funds to cover the debtor escrow balances, the licensee shall immediately on discovery notify the director by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, or other method approved by the department. The licensee shall also provide written notice to the director that includes a description of the remedial action taken by the licensee.</div>

<P>Sec. 23.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   When it appears to the department, either upon complaint or otherwise, that this act, or a rule promulgated under this act, has or is about to be violated, it may, in its discretion, either issue a cease and desist order or require the person to file with it a statement in writing, under oath, or otherwise, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning the subject matter which it believes to be in the public interest to investigate and may investigate those facts, and where appropriate, with or without the request for information, issue a cease and desist order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A person who knowingly authorizes, directs, or aids in violation of a final cease and desist order, or who knowingly fails to comply with the terms of a final cease and desist order, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and may be fined not more than $5,000.00, or imprisoned for not more than 6 months, or both. Each violation constitutes a separate offense.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The department in its discretion may:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Make public or private investigations within or without this state as it deems necessary to determine if a person has violated or is about to violate this act or any rule or order promulgated hereunder or to aid in the enforcement of this act or in the prescribing of rules and forms hereunder, and publish information concerning the violation of this act or any rule or order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Require or permit any person to file a statement under oath or otherwise subject to the penalties of perjury as the department requires in writing as to all the facts and circumstances concerning the matter to be investigated. Failure to file the statement with all required information within 15 days after receipt of a departmental letter requesting it shall be the basis for issuance of a cease and desist order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   For the purpose of an investigation or proceeding under this act, the department or any officer designated by it may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, agreements, or other documents or records which the department deems relevant or material to the inquiry.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to a person, the circuit court, upon application by the department, may issue to the person an order requiring him to appear before the department, or an officer designated by it, to produce documentary evidence, if so ordered, or to give evidence touching the matter under investigation or in question. Failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A person is not excused from attending and testifying or from producing a document or record before the department, or in obedience to the subpoena of the department or an officer designated by it or in a proceeding instituted by the department on the ground that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to penalty or forfeiture. A person may not be prosecuted or subjected to a penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he is compelled, after validly claiming his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, except that the person testifying is not exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury or contempt committed in testifying.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   When it appears to the department that a person is engaged or about to engage in an act or practice which constitutes or will constitute a violation of this act, or a rule promulgated under this act, it may in its discretion, bring an action in the circuit court for Ingham county or another circuit court to enjoin the act or practice and upon a proper showing a permanent or temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted without bond.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If an issuer's nonexempt sales of a security in this state during a 1-year notice filing period exceed the projections for that period that the issuer had submitted to the administrator for determination of the issuer's renewal fee for that 1-year notice filing period, the issuer is not required to amend its projections or pay an additional fee for that notice filing period. However, the fee for renewal of the notice filing shall be the greater of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) If the administrator determines that for 2 consecutive 1-year notice filing periods an issuer's nonexempt sales of a security in this state exceeded the issuer's sales projections for that period, the administrator may assess the issuer an administrative fine in the amount of the renewal fees the issuer would have paid under subdivision (a) if its projections had been accurate. This administrative fine is in addition to an increased fee for renewal under subdivision (c), if any.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the administrator finds that there is a failure to comply with a notice or fee requirement of this section, the administrator may issue a stop order suspending the offer and sale of a federal covered security in this state, except a federal covered security under section 18(b)(1) of the securities act of 1933, 15 USC 77r.

If a posteffective amendment is made to increase the number of securities specified to be offered or sold, the person filing the amendment shall pay a registration fee calculated in the manner specified in subsection (2).

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Enforcement of civil liability under this section is subject to the securities litigation uniform standards act of 1998.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A person is liable to the purchaser if the person sells a security in violation of section 301, or by means of an untrue statement of a material fact or an omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it is made, not misleading, the purchaser not knowing the untruth or omission, and the seller not sustaining the burden of proof that the seller did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care, could not have known of the untruth or omission. All of the following apply to an action under this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The purchaser may maintain an action to recover the consideration paid for the security, less the amount of any income received on the security, and interest at 6% per year from the date of the purchase, costs, and reasonable attorney fees determined by the court, upon the tender of the security, or for actual damages as provided in subdivision (c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The tender referred to in subdivision (a) may be made any time before entry of judgment. Tender requires only notice in a record of ownership of the security and willingness to exchange the security for the amount specified. A purchaser that no longer owns the security may recover actual damages as provided in subdivision (c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Actual damages in an action arising under this subsection are the amount that would be recoverable upon a tender less the value of the security when the purchaser disposed of it and interest at 6% from the date of purchase, costs, and reasonable attorney fees determined by the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A person is liable to the seller if the person buys a security by means of an untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it is made, not misleading, if the seller did not know of the untruth or omission and the purchaser does not sustain the burden of proving that the purchaser did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the untruth or omission. All of the following apply to an action under this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The seller may maintain an action to recover the security, any income received on the security, costs, and reasonable attorney fees determined by the court, on the tender of the purchase price, or for actual damages as provided in subdivision (c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The tender referred to in subdivision (a) may be made any time before entry of judgment. Tender requires only notice in a record of the present ability to pay the amount tendered and willingness to take delivery of the security for the amount specified. If the purchaser no longer owns the security, the seller may recover actual damages as provided in subdivision (c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Actual damages in an action arising under this subsection are the difference between the price at which the security was sold and the value the security would have had at the time of the sale in the absence of the purchaser's conduct causing liability, interest at 6% from the date of sale of the security, costs, and reasonable attorney fees determined by the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A person acting as a broker-dealer or agent that sells or buys a security in violation of section 401(1), 402(1), or 506 is liable to the customer.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A person acting as an investment adviser or investment adviser representative that provides investment advice for compensation in violation of section 403(1), 404(1), or 506 is liable to the client. The client may maintain an action at law or in equity to recover the consideration paid for the advice, interest at 6% from the date of payment, costs, and reasonable attorney fees determined by the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A person that receives, directly or indirectly, any consideration for providing investment advice to another person and that employs a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud the other person or engages in an act, practice, or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit on the other person is liable to the other person. The person defrauded may maintain an action to recover the consideration paid for the advice and the amount of any actual damages caused by the fraudulent conduct that gives rise to liability under this subsection, interest at 6% from the date of the fraudulent conduct, costs, and reasonable attorney fees determined by the court, less the amount of any income received as a result of the fraudulent conduct. This subsection does not apply to a broker-dealer or its agents if the investment advice provided is solely incidental to transacting business as a broker-dealer and no special compensation is received for the investment advice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The following persons are liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as persons liable under subsections (2) to (6):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A person that directly or indirectly controls a person liable under subsections (2) to (6), unless the controlling person sustains the burden of proving that the controlling person did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of the conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An individual who is a managing partner, executive officer, or director of a person liable under subsections (2) to (6), including each individual having a similar status or performing similar functions, unless the individual sustains the burden of proving that the individual did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of the conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An individual who is an employee of or associated with a person liable under subsections (2) to (6) and who materially aids the conduct giving rise to the liability, unless the individual sustains the burden of proving that the individual did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of the conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A person that is a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative that materially aids the conduct giving rise to the liability under subsections (2) to (6), unless the person sustains the burden of proving that the person did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of the conduct by reason of which liability is alleged to exist.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A person liable under this section has a right of contribution as in cases of contract against any other person liable under this section for the same conduct.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A person may not obtain relief if an action is not commenced within 1 of the following time limits, as applicable:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A condition, stipulation, or provision binding a person purchasing or selling a security or receiving investment advice to waive compliance with this act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act is void.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the basis for relief under this section may have been a violation of section 509(2), offers to repurchase the security for cash, payable on delivery of the security, equal to the consideration paid, and interest at 6% per year from the date of purchase, less the amount of any income received on the security, or, if the purchaser no longer owns the security, offers to pay the purchaser upon acceptance of the offer damages in an amount that would be recoverable upon a tender, less the value of the security when the purchaser disposed of it, and interest at 6% from the date of purchase in cash equal to the damages computed in the manner provided in this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If the basis for relief under this section may have been a violation of section 509(3), offers to tender the security, on payment by the seller of an amount equal to the purchase price paid, less income received on the security by the purchaser and interest at 6% from the date of the sale, or if the purchaser no longer owns the security, offers to pay the seller upon acceptance of the offer, in cash, damages in the amount of the difference between the price at which the security was purchased and the value the security would have had at the time of the purchase in the absence of the purchaser's conduct that may have caused liability and interest at 6% from the date of the sale.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the legality or exempt status of a sale of a security made in accordance with this act is contingent on the intrastate nature of that transaction, a person's agreement to purchase, or the purchase of, that security is considered a representation that the person is a resident of this state at the time that agreement is made, and if this representation is subsequently shown to be false, the agreement for the sale of the security is void.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Conduct public or private investigations in or out of this state that the administrator considers necessary or appropriate to determine whether any person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate this act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act, or to aid in the enforcement of this act or the adoption of rules and forms under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Require or permit a person to testify, file a statement, or produce a record, under oath or otherwise as the administrator determines, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning a matter to be investigated or about which an action or proceeding is to be commenced.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An individual is not excused from attending, testifying, filing a statement, producing a record or other evidence, or obeying a subpoena of the administrator under this act or in an action commenced or proceeding instituted by the administrator under this act on the ground that the required testimony, statement, record, or other evidence, directly or indirectly, may tend to incriminate the individual or subject the individual to a criminal fine, administrative or civil fine, or forfeiture. If the individual refuses to testify, file a statement, or produce a record or other evidence on the basis of the individual's privilege against self-incrimination, the administrator may apply to the circuit court to compel the testimony, the filing of the statement, the production of the record, or the giving of other evidence. The testimony, record, or other information compelled under a court order obtained under this subsection shall not be used, directly or indirectly, against the individual in a criminal case, except in a prosecution for perjury, contempt, or otherwise failing to comply with the order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) At the request of the securities regulator of another state or a foreign jurisdiction, the administrator may provide assistance if the requesting regulator states that it is conducting an investigation to determine whether a person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate a law or rule of the other state or foreign jurisdiction relating to securities matters which the requesting regulator administers or enforces. The administrator may provide the assistance by using the authority to investigate and the powers conferred by this section as the administrator determines is necessary or appropriate. The assistance may be provided without regard to whether the conduct described in the request would also constitute a violation of this act or other law of this state if occurring in this state. In deciding whether to provide the assistance, the administrator may consider whether the requesting regulator is permitted and has agreed to provide assistance reciprocally within its state or foreign jurisdiction to the administrator on securities matters when requested, whether compliance with the request would violate or prejudice the public policy of this state, and the availability of resources and employees of the administrator to carry out the request for assistance.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An order under subsection (1) is effective on the date of issuance.

The order must include a statement of any civil fine or costs of the investigation the administrator will seek, a statement of the reasons for the order, and notice that the matter will be scheduled for a hearing within 15 days after receipt of a request in a record from the person. If a person subject to the order does not request a hearing and none is ordered by the administrator within 30 days after the date of service of the order, the order, including any civil fine imposed or requirement for payment of the costs of investigation sought in a statement in that order, becomes final as to that person by operation of law. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the administrator, after notice of and opportunity for hearing to each person subject to the order, may modify or vacate the order or extend it until final determination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a hearing is requested or ordered pursuant to subsection (2), the hearing shall be held pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328.

The final order may make final, vacate, or modify the order issued under subsection (1).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Impose a civil fine of not more than $10,000.00 for a single violation of this act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act or $500,000.00 for multiple violations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) In addition to a civil fine imposed under subdivision (a), if the violation or violations of this act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act includes an act, practice, or course of business directed at, or that resulted in damage to, any of the following, the administrator may impose a civil fine of not more than $10,000.00 for a single violation or $500,000.00 for multiple violations:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Charge the actual cost of an investigation or proceeding for a violation of this act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a petition for judicial review of a final order is not filed in accordance with section 609, the administrator may file a certified copy of the final order with the clerk of a court of competent jurisdiction. The filed order shall have the same effect as a judgment of the court and may be recorded, enforced, or satisfied in the same manner as a judgment of the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a person fails to comply with an order under this section, the administrator may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the order. The court shall not require the administrator to post a bond. If the court finds, after service and opportunity for hearing, that the person is not in compliance with the order, the court may adjudge the person in civil contempt of the order. The court may impose an additional civil fine against the person for contempt in an amount not less than $10,000.00 or more than $500,000.00 for each violation and may grant any other relief the court determines is just and proper in the circumstances.</div>
