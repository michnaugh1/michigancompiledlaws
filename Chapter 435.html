<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The legislature recognizes the fundamental contribution that Cesar E. Chavez made to this nation by organizing farm workers to campaign for safe and fair working conditions, reasonable wages, decent housing, and the outlawing of child labor. Cesar E. Chavez began working in the fields of Arizona and California at the age of 10. Profoundly influenced by these humble beginnings, Chavez embraced the nonviolent principles of Mohandas Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to crusade against racial and economic discrimination, coordinate voter registration drives, and found the united farm workers of America. In 1994, Chavez was posthumously awarded the presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor given to civilians by the United States government. In memory of this great American, the legislature declares that March 31 of each year shall be known as "Cesar E. Chavez Day".</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The legislature recognizes the exceptional contributions to American life, history, and leadership made by Gerald R. Ford, the thirty-eighth president of the United States and the only United States president from Michigan, who for decades has served the United States and the state of Michigan. For much of his life, President Ford resided in Grand Rapids. He attended South high school in Grand Rapids and the university of Michigan in Ann Arbor. He served with distinction as a member of the United States house of representatives, vice president of the United States, and president of the United States. Among numerous other awards and honors, President Ford has received the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the nation, and the Congressional Gold Medal for his "dedicated public service and outstanding humanitarian contributions". In commemoration of the significant role Gerald R. Ford has played in the history of the state of Michigan and our nation, the legislature declares that July 14 of each year shall be known as "President Gerald R. Ford Day".</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The legislature recognizes the outstanding contributions to American life, history, and culture made by Henry Ford, founder of Ford motor company and a man of great vision. During most of his life, Henry Ford resided in Dearborn. He pioneered industrial mass production methods and made an automobile that was affordable for his workers. The Ford motor company debuted the Model T in 1908; by 1918, fully half of all cars sold in America were Model Ts. In 1910, Ford opened a large automobile factory in Highland Park; later, he introduced the moving assembly line. This innovation reduced costs, increased production, and revolutionized industrial manufacturing in the United States and abroad. In honor of the significant role Henry Ford has played in the history of the state of Michigan and the United States, the legislature declares that July 30 of each year shall be known as "Henry Ford Day".</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The legislature recognizes the contributions to civil liberties made by Fred Korematsu. Fred Korematsu was born to Japanese immigrant parents in Oakland, California, on January 30, 1919, the third of 4 sons. Fred Korematsu was 1 of the many American citizens of Japanese ancestry living on the West Coast during World War II. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued Executive Order No. 9066 on February 19, 1942. The order authorized the Secretary of War and his military commanders to require all Americans of Japanese ancestry to be placed in incarceration camps. Fred Korematsu is famously known for his arrest, at the age of 23, on May 30, 1942, and conviction on September 8, 1942 for defying the government's order to report to an assembly center to be moved to an incarceration camp. He appealed his case all the way to the United States Supreme Court. In the December 1944 landmark decision of Korematsu  v United  States, the high court ruled against him with a 6-to-3 decision that declared that the incarceration was justified by the Army's claims that Americans of Japanese ancestry were radio-signaling enemy ships from shore and were prone to dishonesty. Fred Korematsu later moved to Detroit, Michigan, where his younger brother resided. There he met his wife Kathryn, and the 2 wed before moving to the state of California to raise their children, Karen and Ken. Fred Korematsu's conviction was formally vacated on November 10, 1983 by United States District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel of the United States District Court of Northern California in San Francisco. This action, considered to be a pivotal moment in civil rights history, cleared Fred Korematsu's name but did not overturn the 1944 Supreme Court decision. Fred Korematsu remained an activist throughout his life. On February 9, 1989, Fred Korematsu spoke to 400 people at the University of Michigan Law School. He said, "America finally came through for me, but I don't want this to happen again". In 1998, he received the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, from President Clinton for his contributions. Fred Korematsu served on the Constitution Project's bipartisan Liberty and Security Committee from 2001 until his death on March 30, 2005. Fred Korematsu was recognized in 2010 when the state of California passed the Fred Korematsu day of civil liberties and the constitution bill, making January 30 of each year the first day in United States history designated to honor an Asian American. Fred Korematsu Day has also been recognized in the states of Hawaii, Utah, Georgia, and Virginia. Fred Korematsu is considered by many as a national civil rights hero whose growing legacy continues to inspire people of all backgrounds.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The legislature recognizes that the horrors of the Holocaust should never be forgotten. The Holocaust was the state-sponsored, systematic persecution and annihilation of European Jewry by Nazi Germany and its collaborators between 1933 and 1945. In addition to the murder of some 6,000,000 Jews, millions more, including the handicapped, Poles, Gypsies, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, prisoners of war, and political dissidents, also suffered grievous oppression and death under Nazi tyranny.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A key date in the history of the Holocaust is April 19, 1943, the beginning of the Warsaw ghetto uprising, when Jews, using homemade bombs and stolen or bartered weapons, resisted death camp deportation by the Nazis for 27 days. This date, which in the Hebrew calendar is the twenty-seventh day of Nisan, has been established by the United States congress as a national Holocaust remembrance day, and the week surrounding this date has been established as the Days of Remembrance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The legislature declares that the twenty-seventh day of the month of Nisan in the Hebrew calendar shall be Holocaust remembrance day, and that the period beginning on the Sunday before that day through the following Sunday shall be the Days of Remembrance in this state, in memory of the victims of the Holocaust, and in honor of the survivors, as well as the rescuers and liberators.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The legislature recognizes the fundamental contribution that Willie Horton has made to the city of Detroit and the state of Michigan through his humanitarian works. Raised in a Detroit housing project, Willie fulfilled a boyhood dream by playing for his hometown team, the Detroit Tigers. Throughout his career, Willie has been involved with such organizations as the United Way, the Boys and Girls Club of America, Meals on Wheels, and the Foundation Fighting Blindness. His dedication to helping the youth of his city and beyond has been a hallmark of his playing career and in the years since he left the game. In 1967, Willie used his ambassadorship and goodwill to help crush the violence that erupted during the riots in Detroit. In 2000, the Detroit Tigers further honored this man by retiring his number and erecting a statue in his image at Comerica Park. In recognition of this great man, the legislature declares October 18 of each year to be known as "Willie Horton Day".</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The legislature recognizes the fundamental contribution Sojourner Truth made to the abolition of slavery, to the establishment of equal rights for women, and to several other significant social reform and human justice movements in the nineteenth century. Truth toured the nation for more than 40 years as a forceful and passionate advocate for the dispossessed, using her quick wit and fearless tongue to deliver her message of equality and justice. She lived in Battle Creek, Michigan, from 1857 until her death on November 26, 1883. Empowered by her religious faith, the former slave worked tirelessly for many years to transform national attitudes and institutions. According to Nell Painter, Princeton professor and Truth biographer, "No other woman who had been through the ordeal of slavery managed to survive with sufficient strength, poise, and self-confidence to become a public presence over the long term". Designating Sojourner Truth Day in this state not only acknowledges the importance of this national figure in the antislavery and human justice movements, but it also recognizes her strong ties to this state during her 26 years of Michigan residence. In recognition of this great woman, the legislature declares that November 26 of each year shall be known as "Sojourner Truth Day".</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The legislature recognizes all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Women have proudly served the United States in many military roles throughout its history. The roles include, but are not limited to, all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Soldiers, disguised as men, during the American Revolution and the American Civil War.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Nurses in World War I.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Combat helicopter pilots in Afghanistan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Women have served as an informal part of the United States Armed Forces since its inception. Women have served as a formal part of the United States Armed Forces since the establishment of the Army Nurse Corps in 1901.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) In 1917, the United States Navy announced that it would allow women to enlist. During World War I, approximately 12,000 women served in the United States Navy as couriers and translators, among other roles. By 1945, the end of World War II, there were approximately 280,000 women in the United States Armed Forces.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Women were permitted to serve as permanent members of the United States Armed Forces with the enactment of the women's armed services integration act of 1948, but the federal law restricted women to not more than 2% of the enlisted force for each branch of the United States Armed Forces. A subsequent act in 1967 lifted the restriction and allowed women to achieve higher military rank.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Laws passed since the 1970s have formally granted veteran status to women with World War II service; have recognized the many contributions made by women veterans; and have allowed women veterans more equal status and access to benefits, opportunities, and programs from the federal government, state governments, and veteran service organizations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) More than 2,000,000 women veterans live in the United States, and approximately 48,000 women veterans reside in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In recognition of women veterans, the legislature declares that June 12 of each year shall be known as "Women Veterans Recognition Day".</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><center><i>The People of the State of Michigan enact:</i></center><BR><BR><B>435.381 Juneteenth.</B><P>Sec. 1.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The legislature recognizes that slavery existed in American history for more than 200 years. Millions of African-Americans were brought to the Americas as slaves stacked in the bottom of slave ships in a 5- to 12-week journey across the Atlantic Ocean known as the "Middle Passage". Although approximately 11,500,000 African-Americans survived the voyage across the ocean, the number of those who died in the inhuman conditions of the passage is probably even higher. Once in the United States, the slaves were subjected to whipping, castration, branding, and rape. The legislature further observes that President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation was issued on January 1, 1863 and declared that all slaves in Confederate-controlled areas were free. In the following months, spontaneous celebrations erupted throughout the United States as African-Americans learned of their freedom. News of the Emancipation Proclamation reached the states at different times, and it was not until June 19, 1865 that the message of freedom reached the state of Texas. In honor of this great moment in United States history, the legislature declares that June 19 of each year shall be known as "Juneteenth".</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The legislature encourages each individual in this state to pause on Juneteenth and reflect on the strong survival instinct of the African-American slaves and the excitement and great joy with which African-Americans first celebrated the emancipation from slavery. It is a reminder to all Americans of the status and importance of Americans of African descent as American citizens.</div>
