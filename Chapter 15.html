<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as expressly provided in section 13, upon providing a public body's FOIA coordinator with a written request that describes a public record sufficiently to enable the public body to find the public record, a person has a right to inspect, copy, or receive copies of the requested public record of the public body. A request from a person, other than an individual who qualifies as indigent under section 4(2)(a), must include the requesting person's complete name, address, and contact information, and, if the request is made by a person other than an individual, the complete name, address, and contact information of the person's agent who is an individual. An address must be written in compliance with United States Postal Service addressing standards. Contact information must include a valid telephone number or electronic mail address. A person has a right to subscribe to future issuances of public records that are created, issued, or disseminated on a regular basis.

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>15.234 Fee; limitation on total fee; labor costs; establishment of procedures and guidelines; creation of written public summary; detailed itemization; availability of information on website; notification to requestor; deposit; failure to respond in timely manner; increased estimated fee deposit; deposit as fee; failure to pay or appeal deposit; request abandoned.</B><P>Sec. 4.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A public body may charge a fee for a public record search, for the necessary copying of a public record for inspection, or for providing a copy of a public record if it has established, makes publicly available, and follows procedures and guidelines to implement this section as described in subsection (4). Subject to subsections (2), (3), (4), (5), and (9), the fee must be limited to actual mailing costs, and to the actual incremental cost of duplication or publication including labor, the cost of search, examination, review, and the deletion and separation of exempt from nonexempt information as provided in section 14. Except as otherwise provided in this act, if the public body estimates or charges a fee in accordance with this act, the total fee must not exceed the sum of the following components:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That portion of labor costs directly associated with the necessary searching for, locating, and examining of public records in conjunction with receiving and fulfilling a granted written request. The public body shall not charge more than the hourly wage of its lowest-paid employee capable of searching for, locating, and examining the public records in the particular instance regardless of whether that person is available or who actually performs the labor. Labor costs under this subdivision shall be estimated and charged in increments of 15 minutes or more, with all partial time increments rounded down.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That portion of labor costs, including necessary review, if any, directly associated with the separating and deleting of exempt information from nonexempt information as provided in section 14. For services performed by an employee of the public body, the public body shall not charge more than the hourly wage of its lowest-paid employee capable of separating and deleting exempt information from nonexempt information in the particular instance as provided in section 14, regardless of whether that person is available or who actually performs the labor. If a public body does not employ a person capable of separating and deleting exempt information from nonexempt information in the particular instance as provided in section 14 as determined by the public body's FOIA coordinator on a case-by-case basis, it may treat necessary contracted labor costs used for the separating and deleting of exempt information from nonexempt information in the same manner as employee labor costs when calculating charges under this subdivision if it clearly notes the name of the contracted person or firm on the detailed itemization described under subsection (4). Total labor costs calculated under this subdivision for contracted labor costs must not exceed an amount equal to 6 times the state minimum hourly wage rate determined under section 4 of the improved workforce opportunity wage act, 2018 PA 337, MCL 408.934. Labor costs under this subdivision shall be estimated and charged in increments of 15 minutes or more, with all partial time increments rounded down. A public body shall not charge for labor directly associated with redaction under section 14 if it knows or has reason to know that it previously redacted the public record in question and the redacted version is still in the public body's possession.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For public records provided to the requestor on any form of nonpaper physical media, the actual and most reasonably economical cost of the nonpaper physical media. The requestor may stipulate that the public records be provided on nonpaper physical media, electronically mailed, or otherwise electronically provided to him or her in lieu of paper copies. This subdivision does not apply if a public body lacks the technological capability necessary to provide records on the particular nonpaper physical media stipulated in the particular instance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) For paper copies of public records provided to the requestor, the actual total incremental cost of necessary duplication or publication, not including labor. The cost of paper copies shall be calculated as a total cost per sheet of paper and shall be itemized and noted in a manner that expresses both the cost per sheet and the number of sheets provided. The fee must not exceed 10 cents per sheet of paper for copies of public records made on 8-1/2- by 11-inch paper or 8-1/2- by 14-inch paper. A public body shall utilize the most economical means available for making copies of public records, including using double-sided printing, if cost saving and available.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The cost of labor directly associated with duplication or publication, including making paper copies, making digital copies, or transferring digital public records to be given to the requestor on nonpaper physical media or through the internet or other electronic means as stipulated by the requestor. The public body shall not charge more than the hourly wage of its lowest-paid employee capable of necessary duplication or publication in the particular instance, regardless of whether that person is available or who actually performs the labor. Labor costs under this subdivision may be estimated and charged in time increments of the public body's choosing; however, all partial time increments shall be rounded down.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The actual cost of mailing, if any, for sending the public records in a reasonably economical and justifiable manner. The public body shall not charge more for expedited shipping or insurance unless specifically stipulated by the requestor, but may otherwise charge for the least expensive form of postal delivery confirmation when mailing public records. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) When calculating labor costs under subsection (1)(a), (b), or (e), fee components shall be itemized in a manner that expresses both the hourly wage and the number of hours charged. The public body may also add up to 50% to the applicable labor charge amount to cover or partially cover the cost of fringe benefits if it clearly notes the percentage multiplier used to account for benefits in the detailed itemization described in subsection (4). Subject to the 50% limitation, the public body shall not charge more than the actual cost of fringe benefits, and overtime wages shall not be used in calculating the cost of fringe benefits. Overtime wages shall not be included in the calculation of labor costs unless overtime is specifically stipulated by the requestor and clearly noted on the detailed itemization described in subsection (4). A search for a public record may be conducted or copies of public records may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge if the public body determines that a waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because searching for or furnishing copies of the public record can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public. A public record search shall be made and a copy of a public record shall be furnished without charge for the first $20.00 of the fee for each request by either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An individual who is entitled to information under this act and who submits an affidavit stating that the individual is indigent and receiving specific public assistance or, if not receiving public assistance, stating facts showing inability to pay the cost because of indigency. If the requestor is eligible for a requested discount, the public body shall fully note the discount on the detailed itemization described under subsection (4). If a requestor is ineligible for the discount, the public body shall inform the requestor specifically of the reason for ineligibility in the public body's written response. An individual is ineligible for this fee reduction if any of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The individual has previously received discounted copies of public records under this subsection from the same public body twice during that calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The individual requests the information in conjunction with outside parties who are offering or providing payment or other remuneration to the individual to make the request. A public body may require a statement by the requestor in the affidavit that the request is not being made in conjunction with outside parties in exchange for payment or other remuneration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A nonprofit organization formally designated by the state to carry out activities under subtitle C of the developmental disabilities assistance and bill of rights act of 2000, Public Law 106-402, and the protection and advocacy for individuals with mental illness act, Public Law 99-319, or their successors, if the request meets all of the following requirements:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Is made directly on behalf of the organization or its clients.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Is made for a reason wholly consistent with the mission and provisions of those laws under section 931 of the mental health code, 1974 PA 258, MCL 330.1931.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Is accompanied by documentation of its designation by the state, if requested by the public body.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A fee as described in subsection (1) shall not be charged for the cost of search, examination, review, and the deletion and separation of exempt from nonexempt information as provided in section 14 unless failure to charge a fee would result in unreasonably high costs to the public body because of the nature of the request in the particular instance, and the public body specifically identifies the nature of these unreasonably high costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A public body shall establish procedures and guidelines to implement this act and shall create a written public summary of the specific procedures and guidelines relevant to the general public regarding how to submit written requests to the public body and explaining how to understand a public body's written responses, deposit requirements, fee calculations, and avenues for challenge and appeal. The written public summary shall be written in a manner so as to be easily understood by the general public. If the public body directly or indirectly administers or maintains an official internet presence, it shall post and maintain the procedures and guidelines and its written public summary on its website. A public body shall make the procedures and guidelines publicly available by providing free copies of the procedures and guidelines and its written public summary both in the public body's response to a written request and upon request by visitors at the public body's office. A public body that posts and maintains procedures and guidelines and its written public summary on its website may include the website link to the documents in lieu of providing paper copies in its response to a written request. A public body's procedures and guidelines must include the use of a standard form for detailed itemization of any fee amount in its responses to written requests under this act. The detailed itemization must clearly list and explain the allowable charges for each of the 6 fee components listed under subsection (1) that compose the total fee used for estimating or charging purposes. Other public bodies may use a form created by the department of technology, management, and budget or create a form of their own that complies with this subsection. A public body that has not established procedures and guidelines, has not created a written public summary, or has not made those items publicly available without charge as required in this subsection is not relieved of its duty to comply with any requirement of this act and shall not require deposits or charge fees otherwise permitted under this act until it is in compliance with this subsection. Notwithstanding this subsection and despite any law to the contrary, a public body's procedures and guidelines under this act are not exempt public records under section 13.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the public body directly or indirectly administers or maintains an official internet presence, any public records available to the general public on that internet site at the time the request is made are exempt from any charges under subsection (1)(b). If the FOIA coordinator knows or has reason to know that all or a portion of the requested information is available on its website, the public body shall notify the requestor in its written response that all or a portion of the requested information is available on its website. The written response, to the degree practicable in the specific instance, must include a specific webpage address where the requested information is available. On the detailed itemization described in subsection (4), the public body shall separate the requested public records that are available on its website from those that are not available on the website and shall inform the requestor of the additional charge to receive copies of the public records that are available on its website. If the public body has included the website address for a record in its written response to the requestor and the requestor thereafter stipulates that the public record be provided to him or her in a paper format or other form as described under subsection (1)(c), the public body shall provide the public records in the specified format but may use a fringe benefit multiplier greater than the 50% limitation in subsection (2), not to exceed the actual costs of providing the information in the specified format.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A public body may provide requested information available in public records without receipt of a written request. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a verbal request for information is for information that a public body believes is available on the public body's website, the public employee shall, where practicable and to the best of the public employee's knowledge, inform the requestor about the public body's pertinent website address.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) In either the public body's initial response or subsequent response as described under section 5(2)(d), the public body may require a good-faith deposit from the person requesting information before providing the public records to the requestor if the entire fee estimate or charge authorized under this section exceeds $50.00, based on a good-faith calculation of the total fee described in subsection (4). Subject to subsection (10), the deposit must not exceed 1/2 of the total estimated fee, and a public body's request for a deposit must include a detailed itemization as required under subsection (4). The response must also contain a best efforts estimate by the public body regarding the time frame it will take the public body to comply with the law in providing the public records to the requestor. The time frame estimate is nonbinding upon the public body, but the public body shall provide the estimate in good faith and strive to be reasonably accurate and to provide the public records in a manner based on this state's public policy under section 1 and the nature of the request in the particular instance. If a public body does not respond in a timely manner as described under section 5(2), it is not relieved from its requirements to provide proper fee calculations and time frame estimates in any tardy responses. Providing an estimated time frame does not relieve a public body from any of the other requirements of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If a public body does not respond to a written request in a timely manner as required under section 5(2), the public body shall do the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Reduce the charges for labor costs otherwise permitted under this section by 5% for each day the public body exceeds the time permitted under section 5(2) for a response to the request, with a maximum 50% reduction, if either of the following applies:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The late response was willful and intentional. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The written request included language that conveyed a request for information within the first 250 words of the body of a letter, facsimile, electronic mail, or electronic mail attachment, or specifically included the words, characters, or abbreviations for "freedom of information", "information", "FOIA", "copy", or a recognizable misspelling of such, or appropriate legal code reference for this act, on the front of an envelope, or in the subject line of an electronic mail, letter, or facsimile cover page. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If a charge reduction is required under subdivision (a), fully note the charge reduction on the detailed itemization described under subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) This section does not apply to public records prepared under an act or statute specifically authorizing the sale of those public records to the public, or if the amount of the fee for providing a copy of the public record is otherwise specifically provided by an act or statute.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Subject to subsection (12), after a public body has granted and fulfilled a written request from an individual under this act, if the public body has not been paid in full the total amount under subsection (1) for the copies of public records that the public body made available to the individual as a result of that written request, the public body may require a deposit of up to 100% of the estimated fee before it begins a full public record search for any subsequent written request from that individual if all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The final fee for the prior written request was not more than 105% of the estimated fee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The public records made available contained the information being sought in the prior written request and are still in the public body's possession.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The public records were made available to the individual, subject to payment, within the time frame estimate described under subsection (8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Ninety days have passed since the public body notified the individual in writing that the public records were available for pickup or mailing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The individual is unable to show proof of prior payment to the public body.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The public body calculates a detailed itemization, as required under subsection (4), that is the basis for the current written request's increased estimated fee deposit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A public body shall no longer require an increased estimated fee deposit from an individual as described under subsection (11) if any of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The individual is able to show proof of prior payment in full to the public body.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The public body is subsequently paid in full for the applicable prior written request.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Three hundred sixty-five days have passed since the individual made the written request for which full payment was not remitted to the public body.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) A deposit required by a public body under this act is a fee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) If a deposit that is required under subsection (8) or (11) is not received by the public body within 45 days from receipt by the requesting person of the notice that a deposit is required, and if the requesting person has not filed an appeal of the deposit amount pursuant to section 10a, the request shall be considered abandoned by the requesting person and the public body is no longer required to fulfill the request. Notice of a deposit requirement under subsection (8) or (11) is considered received 3 days after it is sent, regardless of the means of transmission. Notice of a deposit requirement under subsection (8) or (11) must include notice of the date by which the deposit must be received, which date is 48 days after the date the notice is sent.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A full explanation of the requesting person's right to do either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Submit to the head of the public body a written appeal that specifically states the word "appeal" and identifies the reason or reasons for reversal of the disclosure denial.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Seek judicial review of the denial under section 10.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Notice of the right to receive attorneys' fees and damages as provided in section 10 if, after judicial review, the court determines that the public body has not complied with this section and orders disclosure of all or a portion of a public record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The individual designated in section 6 as responsible for the denial of the request shall sign the written notice of denial.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a public body issues a notice extending the period for a response to the request, the notice must specify the reasons for the extension and the date by which the public body will do 1 of the following:</div>

If the public body that maintains a law enforcement records management system receives a written request for a public record that is stored on behalf of a subscribing public body, the public body that maintains the law enforcement records management system shall, within 10 business days after receipt of the request, give written notice to the requesting person identifying the subscribing public body and stating that the requesting person shall submit the request to the subscribing public body.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A person making a request under subsection (1) may stipulate that the public body's response under subsection (2) be electronically mailed, delivered by facsimile, or delivered by first-class mail.

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>15.265 Public notice of regular meetings, change in schedule of regular meetings, rescheduled regular meetings, or special meetings; posting; statement of date, time, and place; website; recess or adjournment; emergency sessions; emergency public meeting; meeting in residential dwelling; limitation; notice; duration requirement.</B><P>Sec. 5.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A meeting of a public body shall not be held unless public notice is given as provided in this section by a person designated by the public body.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) For regular meetings of a public body, there shall be posted within 10 days after the first meeting of the public body in each calendar or fiscal year a public notice stating the dates, times, and places of its regular meetings. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If there is a change in the schedule of regular meetings of a public body, there shall be posted within 3 days after the meeting at which the change is made, a public notice stating the new dates, times, and places of its regular meetings. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as provided in this subsection or in subsection (6), for a rescheduled regular or a special meeting of a public body, a public notice stating the date, time, and place of the meeting shall be posted at least 18 hours before the meeting in a prominent and conspicuous place at both the public body's principal office and, if the public body directly or indirectly maintains an official internet presence that includes monthly or more frequent updates of public meeting agendas or minutes, on a portion of the website that is fully accessible to the public. The public notice on the website shall be included on either the homepage or on a separate webpage dedicated to public notices for nonregularly scheduled public meetings and accessible via a prominent and conspicuous link on the website's homepage that clearly describes its purpose for public notification of those nonregularly scheduled public meetings. The requirement of 18-hour notice does not apply to special meetings of subcommittees of a public body or conference committees of the state legislature. A conference committee shall give a 6-hour notice. A second conference committee shall give a 1-hour notice. Notice of a conference committee meeting shall include written notice to each member of the conference committee and the majority and minority leader of each house indicating time and place of the meeting. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A meeting of a public body that is recessed for more than 36 hours shall be reconvened only after public notice that is equivalent to that required under subsection (4) has been posted. If either house of the state legislature is adjourned or recessed for less than 18 hours, the notice provisions of subsection (4) are not applicable. Nothing in this section bars a public body from meeting in emergency session in the event of a severe and imminent threat to the health, safety, or welfare of the public when 2/3 of the members serving on the body decide that delay would be detrimental to efforts to lessen or respond to the threat. However, if a public body holds an emergency public meeting that does not comply with the 18-hour posted notice requirement, it shall make paper copies of the public notice for the emergency meeting available to the public at that meeting. The notice shall include an explanation of the reasons that the public body cannot comply with the 18-hour posted notice requirement. The explanation shall be specific to the circumstances that necessitated the emergency public meeting, and the use of generalized explanations such as "an imminent threat to the health of the public" or "a danger to public welfare and safety" does not meet the explanation requirements of this subsection. If the public body directly or indirectly maintains an official internet presence that includes monthly or more frequent updates of public meeting agendas or minutes, it shall post the public notice of the emergency meeting and its explanation on its website in the manner described for an internet posting in subsection (4). Within 48 hours after the emergency public meeting, the public body shall send official correspondence to the board of county commissioners of the county in which the public body is principally located, informing the commission that an emergency public meeting with less than 18 hours' public notice has taken place. The correspondence shall also include the public notice of the meeting with explanation and shall be sent by either the United States postal service or electronic mail. Compliance with the notice requirements for emergency meetings in this subsection does not create, and shall not be construed to create, a legal basis or defense for failure to comply with other provisions of this act and does not relieve the public body from the duty to comply with any provision of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A meeting of a public body may only take place in a residential dwelling if a nonresidential building within the boundary of the local governmental unit or school system is not available without cost to the public body. For a meeting of a public body that is held in a residential dwelling, notice of the meeting shall be published as a display advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the city or township in which the meeting is to be held. The notice shall be published not less than 2 days before the day on which the meeting is held, and shall state the date, time, and place of the meeting. The notice shall be at the bottom of the display advertisement, set off in a conspicuous manner, and include the following language: "This meeting is open to all members of the public under Michigan's open meetings act".</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A durational requirement for posting a public notice of a meeting under this act is the time that the notice is required to be accessible to the public.</div>

<P>Sec. 5.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   This act, following the evident intent of section 10 of article 4 of the constitution, is aimed to prevent legislators and state officers from engaging in certain activities under circumstances creating a substantial conflict of interest and is not intended to penalize innocent persons. Therefore, no contract shall be absolutely void by reason of this act or the constitutional provision which it implements. Contracts involving a prohibited conflict of interest under this act and said constitutional provision shall be voidable only by decree of a court of proper jurisdiction in an action by the state or a political subdivision which is a party thereto, as to any person, firm, corporation or trust that entered into said contract or took any assignment thereof, with actual knowledge of such prohibited conflict. In the case of a corporation, the actual knowledge must be that of a person or body finally approving the contract for the corporation. All actions to avoid any contract hereunder shall be brought within 1 year after discovery of circumstances suggesting the existence of a violation of the constitutional provision as implemented by this act. In order to meet the ends of justice any such decree shall provide for the reimbursement of any person, firm, corporation or trust for the reasonable value of all moneys, goods, materials, labor or services furnished under the contract, to the extent that the state or political subdivision has benefited thereby. This provision shall not prohibit the parties from arriving at an amicable settlement. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   This act is aimed to prevent public servants from engaging in certain activities and is not intended to penalize innocent persons. Therefore, no contract shall be absolutely void by reason of this act. Contracts involving prohibited activities on the part of public servants shall be voidable only by decree of a court of proper jurisdiction in an action by the public entity, which is a party thereto, as to any person, firm, corporation or trust that entered into the contract or took any assignment thereof, with actual knowledge of the prohibited activity. In the case of the corporation, the actual knowledge must be that of a person or body finally approving the contract for the corporation. All actions to avoid any contract hereunder shall be brought within 1 year after discovery of circumstances suggesting a violation of this act. In order to meet the ends of justice any such decree shall provide for the reimbursement of any person, firm, corporation or trust for the reasonable value of all moneys, goods, materials, labor or services furnished under the contract, to the extent that the public entity has benefited thereby. This provision shall not prohibit the parties from arriving at an amicable settlement.</DIV>

The director or his or her designee shall investigate the matter and decide the issue of whether or not the board member has an undisclosed interest described in section 3(1)(a) or has another conflict of interest sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the board member could render an impartial decision.

If the action did not depend on the vote of that board member, the action of the board stands. If that board member was the deciding vote in an action regarding the matter, the board shall reconsider the action without the participation of the board member who was found to have an interest that was sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether he or she could have rendered an impartial decision.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) As soon as practicable, but not later than 5 business days after a report required to be filed under this act is received, make the report or all of the contents of the report available without charge to the public on a separate internet webpage or its website homepage.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) There is no private right of action, either in law or in equity, under this act. The remedies provided in this act are the exclusive means by which this act may be enforced and by which any harm resulting from a violation of this act may be redressed.</div>
