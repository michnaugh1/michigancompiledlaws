<P>Sec. 4.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Upon the day of hearing the application or any adjournment of the hearing, testimony may be taken from any person or persons interested in the application, and if it satisfactorily appears to the court that there is no reasonable objection to the application, and that it is necessary for the best interest and welfare of the public that the highway be abandoned, discontinued, vacated, or altered as to its course, as prayed for in the application, or if it appears to the court that the highway or any part of the highway should remain as then established, an order shall be entered in the record of the court in accordance with the determination.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a circuit court determines pursuant to this act that an official or officials of a city or village in this state may discontinue, abandon, alter the course, or vacate a public highway or portion of a public highway, and the department of natural resources or, if applicable, the township in which the highway is situated decides to maintain the property as an ingress and egress point, the court shall order the official or officials either to relinquish control to the state or township if the interest is nontransferable or to convey by quitclaim deed whatever interest in the property is held by the local unit of government to the state or township. The township shall have first priority to obtain the property or control of the property as an ingress and egress point. If the township obtains the property or control of the property as an ingress and egress point and later proposes to transfer the property or control of the property, it shall give the department of natural resources first priority to obtain the property or control of the property. If the state obtains the property or control of the property under this subsection, the property shall be under the jurisdiction of the department of natural resources. The state may retain title to the property, transfer title to a local unit of government, or deed the property to the adjacent property owners. If the property was purchased by the state from restricted fund revenue, money obtained from sale of the property shall be returned to that restricted fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If interest in the property is conveyed or control over the property is relinquished to a local unit or this state under subsection (2), the local unit or this state, as applicable, shall operate and maintain the property so as to prevent and eliminate garbage and litter accumulation, unsanitary conditions, undue noise, and congestion as necessary.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a person shows substantial noncompliance with the requirements of subsection (3), the circuit court may order the local unit or this state to close the road ending in a manner to prevent ingress and egress to the body of water for a period of up to 30 days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a person shows substantial noncompliance with the requirements of subsection (3) and the circuit court has previously closed the road ending for up to 30 days under subsection (4), the circuit court may order the local unit or this state to close the road ending in a manner to prevent ingress and egress to the body of water for 90 days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If a person shows substantial noncompliance with the requirements of subsection (3) and the circuit court has previously closed the road ending for 90 days under subsection (5), the circuit court may order the local unit or this state to close the road ending in a manner to prevent ingress and egress to the body of water for 180 days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If a person shows substantial noncompliance with the requirements of subsection (3) and the circuit court has previously closed the road ending for 180 days under subsection (6), the circuit court shall order the local unit or this state to show cause why the road ending should not be permanently closed in a manner to prevent ingress and egress to the body of water. Subject to subsection (8), the circuit court shall permanently close the road ending unless the local unit or this state shows cause why the road ending should not be closed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   After a road ending is closed under subsection (7), and unless the property has been conveyed or relinquished to the adjacent landowners under subsection (9), the local unit or this state may petition the circuit court to reopen the road ending. The circuit court may order the road ending reopened if the local unit or this state presents a management plan to and posts a performance bond with the circuit court, and the circuit court finds that the management plan and performance bond are adequate to ensure compliance with subsection (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   After a road ending is closed by the circuit court under subsection (7), 1 or more of the adjacent landowners may petition the circuit court to order the local unit or this state to convey any interest in the property that the local unit or this state holds to the adjacent landowners, or, if the interest is nontransferable, to relinquish control over the property to the adjacent landowners.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   Proceedings under subsection (4), (5), (6), or (7) shall be initiated by application of 7 owners of record title of land in the local unit who own land within 1 mile of the road ending to the circuit court for the county in which the road ending is located. The applicants in proceedings under subsection (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), or (9) shall give the persons described in section 3 notice of the application by registered mail.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The owner of land on which noxious weeds are found growing shall destroy the weeds before they reach a seed bearing stage and prevent their regrowth, or shall prevent them from becoming a detriment to public health. The commissioner shall notify by certified mail with return receipt requested the owner, agent, or occupant of land on which noxious weeds are found growing. The notice shall describe methods of treating and eradicating the noxious weeds and a summary of the provisions of this section. Failure of the commissioner to give the notice does not, however, constitute a defense to an action to enforce the payment of a fine provided for or debt created under this act. If the owner, agent, or occupant refuses to destroy the noxious weeds, the commissioner shall enter upon the land and destroy the noxious weeds. Expenses incurred in the destruction shall be paid by the owner of the land, and the township, city, or village of which the commissioner is an officer shall have a lien against the land for the amount of the expense. The lien shall be enforced in the manner provided by law for the enforcement of construction liens.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A village, city, or township may, whether or not provided in its charter, provide by ordinance enacted for the purpose of controlling and eradicating noxious weeds in subdivided land that if the owner, agent, or occupant of subdivided land in a subdivision in which buildings have been erected on 60% of the lots, or the owner, agent, or occupant of a lot along an improved street in common usage, has failed, after 10 days' notice as provided in this section, to destroy the weeds, for a depth of 10 rods or the depth of the lot, whichever is less, then an agent authorized by the governing body of the township, village, or city may enter upon the lot and destroy noxious weeds by cutting. Mechanical equipment that will not damage the property or the adjacent sidewalk, may be used to cut the noxious weeds. Expenses incurred in the destruction shall be paid by the owner of the lot. The township, village, or city shall have a lien upon the lot for the amount of the expense. The lien shall be enforced in the manner prescribed by charter, by the laws of this state providing for the enforcement of tax liens, or by ordinance passed by the governing body of the township, village, or city.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An owner who refuses to destroy noxious weeds as provided in this section is subject to a fine of not more than $100.00. When collected, the fine shall become a part of the "noxious weed control fund" of the township, village, or city. By ordinance, the township, city, or village may designate the refusal to destroy noxious weeds as provided in this section as a municipal civil infraction, in which case the fine shall be a civil fine. If the city establishes an administrative hearings bureau pursuant to statute to adjudicate and impose sanctions for blight violations, the city by ordinance may designate the refusal to destroy noxious weeds as provided in this section as a blight violation and any fine imposed shall be a civil fine.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) This act does not apply to weeds in fields devoted to growing any small grain crop such as wheat, oats, barley, or rye. In the case of an easement, property such as an abandoned subdivision, strip mine, or gravel pit, public property such as a forest preserve, and all other land as to which definite ownership is not known to the commissioner and cannot be established, the county board of commissioners shall cause the destruction of noxious weeds in accordance with this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the county board of commissioners of a county passes a resolution to participate under this act, the commissioner of noxious weeds shall notify the department of natural resources and environment, which shall determine whether there is land in the county belonging to this state under the jurisdiction of the department. The department of natural resources and environment shall cut noxious weeds growing on that land within 10 rods of any privately owned improved property, upon receipt of the notification. If the department of natural resources and environment fails to cut the weeds, the commissioner of noxious weeds shall enter upon the land and destroy the weeds. The expense shall be a charge against the department of natural resources and environment and may be recovered in an action in the court of claims.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided under subsection (2), telegraph, telephone, power, and other public utility companies, cable television companies, broadband companies, and municipalities may enter upon, construct, and maintain telegraph, telephone, or power lines, pipelines, wires, cables, poles, conduits, sewers or similar structures upon, over, across, or under any public road, bridge, street, or public place, including, longitudinally within limited access highway rights-of-way, and across or under any of the waters in this state, with all necessary erections and fixtures for that purpose. A telegraph, telephone, power, and other public utility company, cable television company, broadband company, and municipality, before any of this work is commenced, shall first obtain the consent of the governing body of the city, village, or township through or along which these lines and poles are to be constructed and maintained.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A utility as defined in 23 CFR 645.105 may enter upon, construct, and maintain utility lines and structures, including pipelines, longitudinally within limited access highway rights-of-way and under any public road, street, or other subsurface that intersects any limited access highway at a different grade, in accordance with standards approved by the state transportation commission and the Michigan public service commission that conform to governing federal laws and regulations and is not required to obtain the consent of the governing body of the city, village, or township as required under subsection (1). The standards must require that the lines and structures be underground and be placed in a manner that will not increase highway maintenance costs for the state transportation department. The standards may provide for the imposition of a reasonable charge for longitudinal use of limited access highway rights-of-way. The imposition of a reasonable charge is a governmental function, offsetting a portion of the capital, maintenance, and permitting expense of the limited access highway, and is not a proprietary function. The charge must be calculated to reflect a 1-time installation permit fee that does not exceed $1,000.00 per mile of longitudinal use of limited access highway rights-of-way with a minimum fee of $5,000.00 per permit. If the 1-time installation permit fee does not cover the reasonable and actual costs to the department in issuing the permit, the department may assess the utility for the remaining balance. All revenue received under this subsection must be used for capital and maintenance expenses incurred for limited access highways, including the cost of issuing the permit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a city, village, township, county, or county road commission or the state transportation department requests or requires an entity holding a license under the Michigan telecommunications act, 1991 PA 179, MCL 484.2101 to 484.2603, or holding a franchise under the uniform video services local franchise act, 2006 PA 480, MCL 484.3301 to 484.3315, to relocate facilities, the city, village, township, county, or county road commission or the state transportation department may require the entity to obtain a permit for the relocation of the facilities but shall waive any permit fees including, but not limited to, any permit fee under subsection (2). This subsection does not apply if the request to relocate facilities was due to an entity placing facilities in a location not authorized by a current or previous permit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A person engaged in the collection of traffic data or the provision of travel-related information or assistance may enter upon, construct, and maintain electronic devices and related structures within limited access and other highway rights-of-way in accordance with standards approved by the state transportation commission that conform to governing federal laws and regulations. The standards must require that the devices and structures be placed in a manner that will not impede traffic and will not increase maintenance costs for the state transportation department. The state transportation department may enter into agreements to authorize the use of property acquired for or designated as a highway or acquired for or designated for ancillary purposes for the installation, operation, and maintenance of commercial or noncommercial electronic devices and related structures for the collection of traffic data or to assist in providing travel-related information or assistance to motorists who subscribe to travel-related services, the public, or the department. Any revenue generated by the agreements must be deposited in the state trunk line fund established under section 11 of 1951 PA 51, MCL 247.661. The department may accept facilities or in-kind services to be used for public purposes in lieu of, or in addition to, monetary compensation.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the freeway is closed completely to traffic, it must be closed using concrete barriers or equivalent crashworthy temporary traffic barriers. Ramp access to the freeway may be closed with barricades, concrete barriers, or other equivalent crashworthy temporary traffic barriers to maintain access for construction traffic and emergency services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the freeway is not closed completely to traffic and a portion of the freeway is closed at any time between a half hour after sunset to a half hour before sunrise for work scheduled to be done at that time in a contract between a contractor and the state transportation department, concrete barriers or equivalent crashworthy temporary traffic barriers must separate any road workers who are performing work from traffic.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) This section does not apply if the freeway or portion of freeway described in subsection (1) is closed for not more than 3 days for an emergency repair, utility crossing, maintenance, or other short-duration operation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The state transportation department may exercise its engineering judgment in designing and placing concrete barriers or equivalent crashworthy temporary traffic barriers and associated traffic control devices for each closure of a freeway or portion of freeway to account for site-specific conditions, including, but not limited to, roadway grade, equipment malfunctions, emergency service, law enforcement needs, crash history, or work duration. If the engineering judgment determines that the use of concrete barriers would cause additional risks for road users, additional safety measures to protect road workers must be included in the contract between the contractor and the state transportation department.</div>

<P>Sec. 23.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Exclusive of interest, the roll for the total cost of the improvement shall be divided by the number of years in which the total assessment is to be paid.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The owner of any lands assessed a per cent for benefits for improving any highway, who may conceive himself aggrieved by the assessment made by the county road commissioners, or the state highway commissioner, may, within 10 days after the hearing of the review heretofore provided by the county road commissioners, or the state highway commissioner, appeal therefrom, and for such purpose make an application to the probate court of the county in which his land is situate, for a review of the per cent of benefits assessed for such improvement upon his land in any township. Said appellant shall file with the probate court a bond in the sum of 200 dollars, with 1 or more sureties, to be approved by said court, conditioned for the payment of all costs in case the assessment made by the county road commissioners, or the state highway commissioner, shall be sustained. In case the assessment of the per cent of benefits made by the county road commissioners, or the state highway commissioner, upon lands assessed in that township shall be sustained by the board of review, the appellant shall pay the whole cost of such appeal. Such cost and expenses shall be ascertained and determined by the probate court; and if not paid the appellant shall be liable on his bond for the full amount of such costs in an action in law to be brought by the county road commissioners, or the state highway commissioner, before any court having jurisdiction. If the assessments made by the county road commissioners, or the state highway commissioner, on lands in such townships shall be changed, the road districts shall pay the cost of such appeal.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   On the receipt of such claim of appeal by the land owner and the giving of a bond as aforesaid, the probate court shall appoint a board of review to examine into and equalize the apportionment of the per cent of benefits assessed upon lands within the assessment district. Such board of review shall consist of 3 competent and disinterested freeholders selected from townships in the same county, adjoining the township where the land of the appellant is situated outside of the assessment district. Notice of the appointment of the board of review to review the apportionment of the per cent of benefits upon lands shall be given by posting a notice thereof in 5 public and conspicuous places in the special assessment district at least 5 days prior to the hearing in the probate court for the appointment of such board of review. Such board of review when appointed shall give notice of its hearing in the matter, and of the time and place when and where it will meet to review the apportionment of benefits upon the lands in the assessment district, by posting a notice thereof at least 5 days before the day of hearing in 5 public and conspicuous places within the special assessment district. Such board of review shall also cause a copy of such notice to be delivered to the appellant, or left at his place of residence, if his residence is within the said district. If the assessment district is situated in more than 1 county the application for the board of review and the appointment thereof shall be made in the same manner as is hereinbefore provided for the application for and the appointment of the board of review to equalize and review assessments made upon the counties at large, the several townships, and the assessment district in any such case. When so selected said board of review shall proceed to review the assessments upon all lands within the assessment district as provided in this section and in the following section.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   As the work of improvement progresses, the county road commissioners, or the state highway commissioner, shall cause written estimates to be made, and certificates of work done and materials furnished, according to specifications, and of the value of the work accomplished by the several contractors. These estimates and certificates shall be made and signed by a competent engineer. At the request of any contractor doing work, such estimate shall be made at least once in each month. The county road commissioners, or the state highway commissioner, shall make no payment on any contract without such written estimates and certificates that the work is done according to specifications where the total contract price shall be 500 dollars or over. Before the final completion of the work and its final acceptance, they shall not pay more than 80 per cent of the amount of such estimates and certificates: Provided, That upon satisfactory showing of the paying of outstanding indebtedness as hereinafter provided the amount retained on such estimates may be proportionately reduced in the discretion of the state highway commissioner or the board of county road commissioners as the work progresses. Before payment is made on any estimate or certificate aforesaid, the contractor shall file an affidavit showing, either that all labor and material so far used in the improvement has been paid for by him, or an itemized statement giving the several amounts and names of persons to whom anything is owing for labor and material used in the particular improvement contracted for by him, or he shall file releases from all persons unpaid for either labor or material used in such improvement. In case it appears from such affidavits that any labor or material is not paid for, the county road commissioners, or the state highway commissioner, shall deduct from any payment to be made by them such indebtedness for material and labor. The county road commissioners, or the state highway commissioner, out of money so retained by them, may pay any such indebtedness; and they shall pay such indebtedness out of such money on the request of any contractor. They shall not be obliged to pay on the request of a creditor until such creditor shall have put his claim into final judgment.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 67.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A tax assessed under this act upon any property or sale of the property shall not be held invalid by any court of this state on account of any irregularity in any assessment, or on account of any tax roll not having been made, or proceeding had within the time required by law, or on account of the property having been assessed without the name of the owner, or in the name of any person other than the owner, or on account of any other irregularity, informality, omission, or want of any matter or form or substance in any proceeding that does not prejudice the property rights of the person whose property is taxed. All proceedings in assessing and levying taxes, and in the sale and conveyance therefor, shall be presumed by all the courts of this state to be legal until the contrary is affirmatively shown. All records, statements and certificates provided for under this act shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein set forth. The absence of any record of any proceeding or proceedings, or the omission of any mention in any record of any vote or proceeding, or mention of any matter in any statement or certificate that should appear therein under this act, does not affect the validity of any proceeding, tax, or title thereon, if the fact that the vote or proceeding was had or tax authorized is shown by any other record, statement or certificate made evidence by the terms of this act or any other law of this state. A tax or sale of property for any tax shall not be rendered or held invalid by showing that any record, statement, affidavit, certificate, paper, or return cannot be found in the proper office. Unless the contrary is affirmatively shown, the presumption shall be that the record was made, and that the certificate, statement, affidavit, paper, or return was duly made and filed. If any statement, certificate, or record is required to be made or signed by the county road commissioners, that statement, certificate, or record may be made and signed by the members of the commission, or a majority of them, and it is not necessary that other members be present when each signs the statement, certificate, or record. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to authorize any showing impeaching the validity of any deed executed by the state treasurer under this act, but the deed shall be held absolute and conclusive as provided in general tax laws of this state.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 1d.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The governing body of a city or village and the state highway commission may enter into a contract to effectuate joint participation in the cost of opening, widening and improving, including construction and reconstruction, of a state trunk line highway, the terms of which contract, when approved by the state administrative board, shall establish the responsibilities of each party and provide for the method of payment for such joint obligations. The agreements may provide for deferring payment by the city or village until the completion of the project. Contracts and agreements between the state highway commission and the legislative body of any city or village, approved by the state administrative board, are authorized and approved whether heretofore or hereafter made. All agreements entered into prior to January 1, 1968, between the state highway department and any city or village pursuant to this act may be renegotiated by the state highway commission for the purpose of providing for participation in the cost of construction between the highway commission and the city or village on the basis of the participation provisions of section 1c. The renegotiation shall be authorized only for all or any part or unit of the state trunk line highway projects which have not been placed under contract for construction by the highway commission on January 1, 1968. Under any contract heretofore or hereafter made which relates to a state trunk line highway project for which federal highway funds are allocated or paid, the portion of the cost to be paid by a city or village shall be in accordance with the percentage of participation required by law at the time the contract was entered into applied to the net cost of the project after deduction from the total cost of all federal highway funds allocated or paid for the project. In all contracts hereafter made an amount equivalent to the federal highway funds for the acquisition of right of way as would have been available if application had been made therefor and approved by the federal government, shall also be deducted from the total cost in determining the net cost. Any city or village paying a portion of the cost of improving trunk lines or trunk line structures, including cost of right of way, within its corporate limits may raise money for that purpose, either by taxation or by the issuance of bonds or short term loans therefor, on the faith and credit of the city or village. The bonds or loans shall not be chargeable against the established bonded debt limit of the city or village, if a special assessment district is established in connection with the improvement. The execution of the contracts or agreements shall not restrict any right of the city or village to establish special assessment districts in connection with the improvements. The construction, maintenance and improvement of the trunk line highways and the direction, supervision and control of same by the state highway commission as provided in sections 1a, 1b and 1c may be modified in the contracts authorized by this act to such extent as may be agreed upon.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Notwithstanding section 1h, the department may conduct pavement demonstration projects to evaluate new construction methods, materials, or designs that do not have actual Michigan historical project maintenance, repair, or resurfacing schedules or costs recorded by the pavement management system. The department may conduct a pavement demonstration project that may be all or a portion of that project using either concrete or asphalt as determined by the department. Each demonstration project shall include measurable goals and objectives for determining the success of that project. The department shall measure the interim success of each demonstration project each year and make a final report for each demonstration project following the demonstration life of the project, which may be shorter than the actual pavement life of the material used for the project, that assesses the cost-effectiveness and performance of the pavement materials and design used in the project and compares the results to the pavement material identified under the department's standard pavement selection process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A demonstration project shall not be conducted without the approval of the department. If a proposed demonstration project is rejected, the department shall provide an explanation of the reason for the rejection to the person that proposed the demonstration project. Demonstration projects shall be selected using any of the following criteria:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Pavement designs intended to increase pavement life expectancy in a manner that will result in lowered life-cycle costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Pavement designs intended to improve performance, including, but not limited to, friction, surface stress, reduction of noise, and improvement of ride quality.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Comparisons of performance of various types of pavement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the difference between the total cost of contracts awarded for demonstration projects under this section using asphalt and concrete in any contiguous 3-year period is more than, or is anticipated to be more than, 25%, the department shall submit a detailed letter of explanation to the chairs of the senate and house of representatives transportation committees, the senate majority leader, and the speaker of the house of representatives explaining why there is a difference and recommendations on how the department will reduce the difference to below 25% over the next 3 years. As used in this subsection, "total costs" means the initial engineer's estimated costs of the pavement design portion of the project. Nothing in this subsection requires that any individual demonstration project be duplicated with both asphalt and concrete.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) No later than December 1, 2015, the department shall form a special internal task force specifically named the roads innovation task force. The purpose of the task force shall be to create a comprehensive public report that does all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Evaluates road materials and construction methods that, when implemented, could allow the department to build high-quality roads in this state that last longer than those typically constructed by the department, with a goal of roads lasting at least 50 years, higher quality roads, and reduced maintenance costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Focuses on materials and processes that may cost more in initial up-front spending but that still produce life-cycle construction and maintenance savings. The department shall strive to achieve a reduction of at least 50% in its net present value 50-year life cycle costs as compared to the commensurate net present value 50-year life cycle costs for road construction and maintenance costs from 2015, in a manner that results in no state roads being rated in poor condition and has no net degradation from overall 2015 level pavement surface evaluation and rating (PASER) scores within the plan's first 10 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Focuses on longer-term time frames that seek to maximize value to the taxpayers of this state on a total cost basis, regardless of funding or financing considerations. The report shall not incorporate or reference plans or suggestions regarding bonding, refinancing, or financing innovations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Not later than March 1, 2016, the department shall finalize and make public the report described in subsection (1). The task force shall present that report at a public hearing before a joint committee hearing of the standing committees of the senate and house of representatives with primary responsibility for transportation issues called by the chairs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Not later than June 1, 2016, the task force shall update the finalized report described in subsection (2) to provide suggested boilerplate language which coincides with how the department would execute the plan and attempt to achieve the targets described in subsection (1). The plan shall include sufficient detail to allow the legislature to monitor and track progress, estimate how long it is expected to take to achieve targets, and project what the inflation adjusted reduction in annual spending will be once fully implemented as compared to the costs associated with 2015.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Beginning in fiscal year 2016-2017 and each fiscal year thereafter, the first $100,000,000.00 received and collected attributable to taxes imposed under section 8(1) of the motor fuel tax act, 2000 PA 403, MCL 207.1008, shall be annually deposited into the state treasury to the credit of the roads innovation fund created in subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The roads innovation fund is created within the state treasury. The state treasurer may receive money or other assets from any source for deposit into the roads innovation fund. The state treasurer shall direct the investment of the roads innovation fund. The state treasurer shall credit to the roads innovation fund interest and earnings from fund investments. Money in the roads innovation fund at the close of the fiscal year shall remain in the roads innovation fund and shall not lapse to the general fund. The department of treasury shall be the administrator of the fund for auditing purposes. The department shall expend money from the fund only after each house of the legislature approves a 1-time concurrent resolution on a record roll call vote to release money in the roads innovation fund.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The board of county road commissioners of each county may establish a system of seasonal county roads, which may be part of either the county primary road system, the county local road system, or both systems. A board of county road commissioners in establishing a system of seasonal county roads, may declare a road under the jurisdiction of the board to not be open to public travel during the months of November through April, which road shall then not be open to public travel.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The seasonal county road system shall include any road under the jurisdiction of the board of county road commissioners which that board determines shall not be open to public travel each year for a period of less than 12 months. The system of seasonal county roads shall be selected on the basis of seasonal use of the roads and in accordance with rules promulgated by the state transportation department. A board of county road commissioners may include or exclude roads in the seasonal county road system upon adoption of a proper resolution but only after holding a public hearing. Notice of the public hearing shall be given to the clerk of the county and of each city, village, or township in which the roads are situated and published at least twice in a newspaper of general circulation in that county, the first notice to be not less than 30 days before the hearing and the second notice not less than 7 days before the hearing. The notice shall contain the date, time, and place of the hearing and shall describe in general terms the action proposed to be taken by the board, the roads to be affected, and the period of time that the roads shall not be open to public travel.

In addition to the other notices required by this subsection, public notice of the time, date, and place of the hearing shall be given in the manner required by Act No. 267 of the Public Acts of 1976, as amended. If at the hearing an objection is made to the designation of a road as a part of the seasonal county road system by a person occupying a structure located upon or along the road as the person's principal residence, the commissioners shall not designate that road as a part of the seasonal county road system unless the commissioners provide that person with immediate access to a road which is not a part of the seasonal county road sytsem.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Within 30 days after final adoption of a resolution establishing a seasonal county road system, the board of county road commissioners shall file with the state transportation department and each city, village, or township in which the roads are situated a full record of its determination.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The designation of a road as part of the seasonal county road system shall not affect the certification of the road under this act, but if the road is not open to public travel during the months of December to April, the road shall be excluded for purposes of the distribution of snow removal funds under section 12a.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A road included as part of the seasonal county road system shall be excluded for the purposes of determining the distribution of funds under sections 12(4) and 12b for each year in which the road is part of the seasonal county road system.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A map shall be maintained and on display in the office of each board of county road commissioners which has established a seasonal county roads system which shall also inform the public of the dates the road or road shall not open to public travel.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The board shall place and maintain signs on all roads designated as seasonal county roads, which signs shall describe the roads as seasonal county roads.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A ratio with a numerator that is the total local bridge deck area in the region and a denominator that is the total local bridge deck area in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A ratio with a numerator that is the total amount of structurally deficient local bridge deck area in the region and a denominator that is the total amount of structurally deficient local bridge deck area in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The regional bridge councils shall allocate the money received from the board for the preservation, improvement, and reconstruction of existing bridges or for the construction of bridges to replace existing bridges in whole or in part in each region.</div>

The department shall take into consideration the availability of federal aid and other financial resources of the highway authority responsible for the bridge, the importance of the bridge to the highway, road, or street network, and the condition of the existing bridge.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The revenue appropriated to the local bridge fund under subsection (1)(i) must be distributed only to the local bridge advisory board, the regional bridge councils, cities, villages, and county road commissions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The regional bridge councils shall determine what bridge projects are selected for funding from the local bridge fund created in subsection (4) and shall make a list of selected projects available to interested parties in the region. A determination that a bridge project is selected for funding in a given fiscal year is not approval to disburse the money.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) A county road commission, city, or village may implement a bridge project if the bridge project has been selected for funding and is included in the appropriate regional bridge council's current multiyear bridge plan for the local bridge program but the regional bridge council has not allocated money to the bridge project for the fiscal year that the bridge project is on the current multiyear bridge plan. A county road commission, city, or village may borrow money to implement a project that has been selected for funding and is included in the appropriate regional bridge council's current multiyear bridge plan but has not been allocated money by the regional bridge council. Based on available local bridge money, when a bridge project that was implemented with borrowed money is allocated funding in a subsequent fiscal year, the funding must only be used to repay the amount approved by the multiyear bridge plan when the money was borrowed. To be eligible for repayment of the amount borrowed, a bridge project that has been implemented with borrowed money must be administered through the department's local bridge program.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Annually the state transportation department shall determine the miles of state trunk line highways, county primary and local roads, and city and village major and local streets transferred to and from state, county, city, or village jurisdiction during the preceding period of July 1 to June 30. In each year after that determination, the transferred mileage shall be accumulated and added to the mileage transferred in each subsequent July 1 to June 30 period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The current average revenue worth per mile of a county primary road and a county local road shall be determined annually by dividing the total county primary and local road mileages respectively as of the first day of the preceding July 1 to June 30 period into the total amount of Michigan transportation funds returned to counties pursuant to this act for use on county primary and local roads respectively during that period, except money returned to counties pursuant to section 12(2) and (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The total amount of money to be transferred from and to the state trunk line fund, the counties, cities, and villages shall be determined annually by multiplying the current revenue worth per mile of a county primary road and a county local road respectively by the number of accumulated miles in each category transferred from and to state, county, city, or village jurisdiction. If the transferred facility becomes classified as part of the local road or street system of the receiving jurisdiction, the transfer of money shall be calculated on the basis of the revenue worth per mile of a county local road. In any other category of jurisdictional transfer, the transfer of money shall be calculated on the basis of the revenue worth per mile of a county primary road.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   For jurisdictional transfers made from the state to a county, city, or village after July 1, 1992, the amount in the state trunk line fund to be transferred shall be transferred to the county, city, or village receiving jurisdiction. If the transferred highway is then classified as part of the local road or street system of the receiving jurisdiction, the transfer of money to the receiving jurisdiction shall be calculated on the basis of the revenue worth per mile of a county local road as determined in subsection (2). If the transferred highway is then classified as part of the primary road or major street system of the receiving jurisdiction, the transfer of money to the receiving jurisdiction shall be calculated on the basis of the revenue worth per mile of a county primary road as determined in subsection (2). This subsection and subsection (5) shall not be construed to effect contracts entered into before or after the effective date of this subsection pursuant to Act No. 166 of the Public Acts of 1965, being sections 408.551 to 408.558 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, for the maintenance of a transferred highway.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   In cities and villages with a population of 25,000 or more, trunk line mileage that is transferred to local jurisdiction after July 1, 1992 and is then classified as a major street shall be certified at twice its measured length.</DIV>

The issuance of the notes of an eligible authority in anticipation of payment of proceeds from the comprehensive transportation fund shall be authorized by a borrowing resolution of the eligible authority under the metropolitan transportation authorities act of 1967, 1967 PA 204, MCL 124.401 to 124.426, or a regional transit authority under the regional transit authority act. The issuance of the notes under this section is not subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821, and shall be subject to the prior approval of the state transportation commission.

The principal amount of notes for which the funds to be received from the comprehensive transportation fund are pledged shall not exceed 85% of the amount remaining to be received by the eligible authority from the comprehensive transportation fund in the current fiscal year. The pledge of 100% of the funds the eligible authority expects to receive from the comprehensive transportation fund shall be secured by a direct transfer of the pledge funds from the comprehensive transportation fund to the trustee or the Michigan municipal bond authority that is authorized to receive the funds by the borrowing resolution adopted by the eligible authority. The notes of the eligible authority shall not be in any way a debt or a liability of this state and shall not create or constitute any indebtedness, liability, or obligations of this state or be or constitute a pledge of the full faith and credit of this state. Each note shall contain on its face a statement to the effect that the eligible authority is obligated to pay the principal of and the interest on the note only from funds of or due to the eligible authority and that this state is not obligated to pay that principal or interest and that neither the faith in credit nor the taxing power of this state is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on the note. The notes shall mature not more than 13 months from the date of issuance, shall bear interest at a fixed or variable rate or rates of interest per annum, and, in addition to other security required by this section, may be secured by letter or line of credit issued by a financial institution or as provided in the borrowing resolution.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Twenty-three to twenty-seven percent of the DOT-FHWA highway research, planning, and construction federal funds appropriated to this state from the federal government for road and bridge construction must be allocated to programs administered by local jurisdictions after deduction of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Funds that are specifically allocated at the federal level to this state or local jurisdictions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Funds allocated by the department to this state and to local jurisdictions through a competitive process.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The funds must be distributed to eligible local agencies for transportation purposes in a manner consistent with state and federal law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) It is the intent of the legislature that federal aid to highways allocated to local jurisdictions in subsection (1) be distributed in a manner that produces a 25% average allocation of applicable funds to programs for local jurisdictions in each fiscal year through the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000. Beginning in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, the average allocation of applicable federal aid to highway funds to programs for local jurisdictions must be the average of the amount distributed to local jurisdictions under subsection (1) and similarly calculated distributions in each succeeding fiscal year. The average allocation percentage described in this subsection must be adjusted to reflect any agreements made by the department with local jurisdictions regarding the state buyout of local federal aid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Subject to subsections (6) to (15), the department shall award money from the state trunk line fund to local road agencies in exchange for federal aid obligation authority allocated to local-agency projects as provided in this section, if allowed by federal law and rules.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The department must make available money from the state trunk line fund in exchange for federal aid obligation authority awarded to local road agencies in the amounts described in subsection (8) unless the amount must be reduced to do either or both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Match all available federal aid including reapportionments, redistributions, or other awards of federal aid obligation authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Provide for debt service, the minimum state-funded program, routine maintenance of state trunk lines, administration, and all other functions of the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the department reduces the amount of money available from the state trunk line fund under subsection (6), the department must submit a letter to the chairpersons of the senate and house of representatives transportation committees, the chairpersons of the senate and house of representatives transportation appropriations subcommittees, the senate majority leader, and the speaker of the house of representatives explaining why the department is unable to match available federal aid or perform its essential functions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Except if reduced under subsection (6), the amount of money available from the state trunk line fund in exchange for federal aid obligation authority awarded to local road agencies must be not less than the following amounts:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) In the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023, $25,000,000.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) In the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, $35,000,000.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) In the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025, and in every subsequent fiscal year, $45,000,000.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Local road agencies may apply for state money in exchange for 100% of the federal aid obligation authority allocated by the department to a local road agency project in a metropolitan planning organization transportation improvement program or in the rural transportation improvement program, in the manner and on the schedule determined by the department. The department must publish announcements, instructions, forms, and deadlines on its website. If applications are received that request more state money than is available to be exchanged in a fiscal year, awards must be made in the order received.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) State money must be exchanged with local road agencies for federal aid obligation authority in an amount equal to 90 cents per dollar of all federal aid obligation authority allocated in the approved transportation improvement plan to each project for which authority is exchanged.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The department must pay state money exchanged for federal aid obligation authority to local road agencies when sufficient federal aid obligation authority is received from the Federal Highway Administration to cover the exchanges, not including any year-end redistributions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The first priority for the use of state money exchanged for federal aid obligation authority must be the local road agency project for which the federal aid obligation authority was originally proposed. If the state money exchanged for federal aid obligation authority exceeds the cost of the original project, any surplus must be applied to federal-aid-eligible projects by the local road agency or returned to the department. Completed work must be reported to the transportation asset management council investment reporting tool or any successor system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) State money exchanged for federal aid obligation authority must be expended not later than 3 years after the exchange. If the project for which federal aid obligation authority was exchanged cannot be completed within 3 years, the local road agency must notify the department and its metropolitan planning agency or rural task force and identify an alternate project eligible for federal aid that can be constructed within the original 3-year period, or return the money to the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) In accordance with 23 USC 112, 23 CFR 635.104(b), and Federal Highway Administration Directive 5060.1, a local road agency that is awarded state money in exchange for federal aid obligation authority shall follow the policies adopted by the department that govern the number of force accounts and the total amount of money spent on force account project cost authorizations in a fiscal year. For each fiscal year in which a local road agency is awarded state money in exchange for federal aid obligation authority, the local road agency must certify to the department that the limits in this subsection are not exceeded. This subsection applies only to state money awarded in exchange for federal aid obligation authority as described in this section and not to any money garnered through any other means.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) Contracts between local road agencies and contractors for projects funded from state money exchanged for federal aid obligation authority must contain a federal wage and benefits schedule consistent with, and incorporating the requirements of, Section IV of Form FHWA 1273, revised May 1, 2012, or any successor form, and provide that covered workers are third-party beneficiaries of these contract requirements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Federal aid obligation authority" means federal aid obligation authority and an equal amount of contract authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Minimum state-funded program" includes, but is not limited to, preservation, preventive maintenance, maintenance, operations, safety, administration, and all other essential functions not eligible for federal aid, as determined by the department.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A fund to be known as the state trunk line fund is established in the state treasury as a separate fund. The money deposited in the state trunk line fund is appropriated to the department for the following purposes in the following order of priority:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For the payment, but only from money restricted as to use by section 9 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963, of bonds, notes, or other obligations in the following order of priority:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) For the payment of contributions pledged before July 18, 1979 and required to be made by the state highway commission or the state transportation commission under contracts entered into before July 18, 1979, under 1941 PA 205, MCL 252.51 to 252.64, for the payment of the principal and interest on bonds issued under 1941 PA 205, MCL 252.51 to 252.64, for the payment of which a sufficient sum is irrevocably appropriated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) For the payment of the principal and interest upon bonds designated "State of Michigan, State Highway Commissioner, Highway Construction Bonds, Series I", dated September 1, 1956, in the aggregate principal amount of $25,000,000.00, issued pursuant to former 1955 PA 87 and the resolution of the state administrative board adopted August 6, 1956, for the payment of which a sufficient sum is irrevocably appropriated.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For the transfer of money appropriated under section 10(1)(i) to the transportation economic development fund, but the transfer shall be reduced each fiscal year by the amount of debt service to be paid in that year from the state trunk line fund for bonds, notes, or other obligations issued to fund projects of the transportation economic development fund, which amount shall be certified by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For the transfer of money appropriated under section 10(1)(a) to the rail grade crossing account in the state trunk line fund for expenditure for rail grade crossing improvement purposes at rail grade crossings on public roads and streets under the jurisdiction of this state, counties, cities, or villages. The department shall select projects for funding in accordance with the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Not more than 50% or less than 30% of this money and matched federal money shall be expended for state trunk line projects.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) In prioritizing projects for this money, in whole or in part, the department shall consider train and vehicular traffic volumes, accident history, traffic control device improvement needs, and the availability of funding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Consistent with the other requirements for this money, the first priority for money deposited under this subdivision for rail grade crossing improvements and retirement shall be to match federal money from the railroad-highway grade crossing improvement program or other comparable federal programs if a match is required under federal law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) If the department and a road authority with jurisdiction over the crossing formally agree that the grade crossing should be eliminated by permanent closing of the public road or street, the physical removal of the crossing, roadway within railroad rights of way and street termination treatment shall be negotiated between the road authority and railroad company. The money provided to the road authority as a result of the crossing closure shall be credited to its account representing the same road or street system on which the crossing is located and shall be used for any transportation purpose within that road authority's jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) For the transfer of money appropriated under section 10(1)(b) to the grade crossing surface account in the state trunk line fund for expenditure for rail grade crossing surface improvement purposes at rail grade crossings on public roads and streets under the jurisdiction of counties, cities, or villages. Projects shall be selected for funding in accordance with the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) In prioritizing projects, the department shall consider vehicular traffic volumes, relative crossing surface condition, the ability of the railroad and local road authority to make coordinated improvements, and the availability of funding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The grade crossing surface account shall fund 60% of the project cost, with the remaining 40% funded by the railroad company.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Funding under the grade crossing surface account shall be limited to items of work that are normally the responsibility of the railroad under section 309 of the railroad code of 1993, 1993 PA 354, MCL 462.309. Maintenance of the roadway approaches to the crossing will continue to be the responsibility of the party with jurisdiction over that roadway.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) For the total operating expenses of the state trunk line fund for each fiscal year as appropriated by the legislature.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) For the preservation of state trunk line highways and bridges.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) For the opening, widening, improving, construction, and reconstruction of state trunk line highways and bridges, including the acquisition of necessary rights of way and the work incidental to that opening, widening, improving, construction, or reconstruction. Those sums in the state trunk line fund not otherwise appropriated, distributed, determined, or set aside by law shall be used for the construction or reconstruction of the national system of interstate and defense highways, referred to in this act as "the interstate highway system" to the extent necessary to match federal aid money as the federal aid money becomes available for that purpose; and, for the construction and reconstruction of the state trunk line system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The department may enter into agreements with a local road agency or a private sector company to perform work on a highway, road, or street. The agreements may provide for the performance by any of the contracting parties of any of the work contemplated by the contract including maintenance, engineering services, and the acquisition of rights of way in connection with the work, by purchase or condemnation by any of the contracting parties in its own name, and for joint participation in the costs, but only to the extent that the contracting parties are otherwise authorized by law to expend money on the highways, roads, or streets. The department also may contract with a local road agency to advance money to a local road agency to pay the costs of improving railroad grade crossings on the terms and conditions agreed to in the contract. A contract may be executed before or after the state transportation commission borrows money for the purpose of advancing money to a local road agency, but the contract shall be executed before the advancement of any money to a local road agency by the state transportation commission, and shall provide for the full reimbursement of any advancement by a local road agency to the department, with interest, within 15 years after advancement, from any available revenue sources of the local road agency or, if provided in the contract, by deduction from the periodic disbursements of any money returned by the state to the local road agency. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) For providing inventories of supplies and materials required for the activities of the department. The department may purchase supplies and materials for these purposes, with payment to be made out of the state trunk line fund to be charged on the basis of issues from inventory in accordance with the accounting and purchasing laws of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the department shall annually expend at least 90% of state revenue appropriated annually to the state trunk line fund less the amounts described in subdivisions (a) to (i) for the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges and for the payment of debt service on bonds, notes, or other obligations described in subsection (1)(a) issued after July 1, 1983, for the purpose of providing money for the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges. Of the amounts appropriated for state trunk line projects, the department shall, where possible, secure pavement warranties for full replacement or appropriate repair for contracted construction work on pavement projects whose cost exceeds $2,000,000.00 and projects for new construction or reconstruction undertaken after the effective date of the 2015 amendatory act that amended this subsection. The department shall compile and make available to the public an annual report of all warranties that were secured under this subsection and all pavement projects whose costs exceed $2,000,000.00 where a warranty was not secured as provided in subsection (14). If an appropriate certificate is filed under section 18e but only to the extent necessary, this subsection does not prohibit the use of any amount of money restricted as to use by section 9 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 and deposited in the state trunk line fund for the payment of debt service on bonds, notes, or other obligations pledging for the payment thereof money restricted as to use by section 9 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 and deposited in the state trunk line fund, whenever issued, as specified under subsection (1)(a).

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Amounts expended for the construction of a highway, street, road, or bridge to 1 or more of the following or for the payment of debt service on bonds, notes, or other obligations issued after July 1, 1983, for the purpose of providing money for the construction of a highway, street, road, or bridge to 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A location for which a building permit has been obtained for the construction of a manufacturing or industrial facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A location for which a building permit has been obtained for the renovation of, or addition to, a manufacturing or industrial facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Amounts expended for capital outlay other than for highways, roads, streets, and bridges or to pay debt service on bonds, notes, or other obligations issued after July 1, 1983, for the purpose of providing money for capital outlay other than for highways, roads, streets, and bridges.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Amounts expended for the operating expenses of the department other than the units of the department performing the functions assigned on January 1, 1983 to the bureau of highways.</div>

The resolution shall state the cost of the project exempted from this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the department shall expend annually at least 90% of the federal revenue distributed to the credit of the state trunk line fund in that year, except for federal revenue expended for the purposes described in subsection (2)(b), (c), (f), and (i) and for the payment of notes issued under section 18b(9) on the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges. The requirement of this subsection is waived if compliance would cause this state to be ineligible according to federal law for federal revenue, but only to the extent necessary to make this state eligible according to federal law for that revenue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the department may loan money to a local road agency for paying capital costs of transportation purposes described in the second paragraph of section 9 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 from the proceeds of bonds or notes issued pursuant to section 18b or from the state trunk line fund.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) In a county to which money is returned under this section, the function of the county road commission is limited to the formation of policy and the performance of the official duties imposed by law and delegated by the county board of commissioners. A member of the county road commission shall not be employed individually in any other capacity for other duties with the county road commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) A county road commission may enter into an agreement with a county road commission of another county, with a city or village, or with the department, to perform work on a highway, road, or street within the limits of that county or of another county. The agreement may provide for the performance by each contracting party of the work contemplated by the contract including engineering services and the acquisition of rights of way in connection with the work contemplated, by purchase or condemnation, by any of the contracting parties in its own name and the agreement may provide for joint participation in the costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) Money distributed from the Michigan transportation fund may be expended for construction purposes on county local roads only to the extent matched by money from other sources. However, Michigan transportation funds may be expended for the construction of bridges on the county local roads in an amount not to exceed 75% of the cost of the construction of local road bridges. The match may exceed 75% of the cost of construction in the case of a public emergency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, at least 90% of the state revenue returned annually to the county road commission from the Michigan transportation fund less the amounts described in subdivisions (a) to (e) must be expended annually by the county road commission for the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges, and for the payment of contractual contributions pledged for the payment of bonds or portions of bonds, debt service requirements for the payment of bonds or portions of bonds, and debt service requirements for the payment of notes and loans or portions of notes and loans issued or received after July 1, 1983, for the purpose of providing money for the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges. If an appropriate certificate is filed under subsection (18) but only to the extent necessary, this subsection does not prohibit the use of any amount of state revenue returned annually to the county road commissions for the payment of contractual contributions pledged for the payment of bonds, for debt service requirements for the payment of bonds, and for debt service requirements for the payment of notes or loans, whenever issued or received, as specified under subsection (8). The amounts that are deducted from the state revenue returned to a county road commission from the Michigan transportation fund, for the purpose of the calculation required by this subsection are as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Amounts expended for the purposes described in subsection (8) for bonds, notes, loans, or other obligations issued or received before July 2, 1983.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Amounts expended for the administrative costs of the county road commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Amounts expended for capital outlay projects for equipment and buildings, and for the payment of contractual contributions pledged for the payment of bonds, for debt service requirements for the payment of bonds, and for debt service requirements for the payment of notes and loans issued or received after July 1, 1983, for the purpose of providing funds for capital outlay projects for equipment and buildings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Amounts expended for projects vital to the economy of the local area or the safety of the public in the local area. Before these amounts can be deducted, the governing body over the county road commission or the county road commission, as applicable, must pass a resolution approving these projects. This resolution must state the projects that will be funded and the cost of each project. A copy of each approved resolution must be forwarded immediately to the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Amounts expended in urban areas as determined under section 12b.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, except as provided in this subsection, a county road commission shall annually expend at least 90% of the federal revenue distributed to the county road commission for highways, roads, streets, and bridges, less the amount expended on urban routes for purposes other than preservation and the amount expended for hard-surfacing of gravel roads on the federal-aid system, on the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges. A county road commission may expend in 1 year less than 90% of the federal revenue distributed to the county road commission for highways, roads, streets, and bridges, less the amount expended on urban routes for purposes other than preservation and the amount expended for hard-surfacing of gravel roads on the federal-aid system, on the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges, if that year is part of a 3-year period in which at least 90% of the total federal revenue distributed in the 3-year period to the county road commission for highways, roads, streets, and bridges, less the amount expended on urban routes for purposes other than preservation purposes and the amount expended for hard-surfacing of gravel roads on the federal-aid system, is expended on the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges. If a county road commission expends in 1 year less than 90% of the federal revenue distributed to the county road commission for highways, roads, streets, and bridges, less the amount expended on urban routes for purposes other than preservation and the amount expended for hard-surfacing of gravel roads on the federal-aid system, on the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges and that year is not a part of a 3-year period in which at least 90% of the total federal revenue distributed in the 3-year period to the county road commission for highways, roads, streets, and bridges, less the amount expended on urban routes for purposes other than preservation and the amount expended for hard-surfacing of gravel roads on the federal-aid system, is expended on the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges, the county road commission shall expend in each year subsequent to the 3-year period 100%, or less in 1 year if sufficient for the purposes of this subsection, of the federal revenue distributed to the county road commission for highways, roads, streets, and bridges, less the amount expended on urban routes for purposes other than preservation and the amount expended for hard-surfacing of gravel roads on the federal-aid system, on the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges until the average percentage spent on the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges in the 3-year period and the subsequent years, less the amount expended on urban routes for purposes other than preservation and the amount expended for hard-surfacing of gravel roads on the federal-aid system, is at least 90%. A year may be included in only one 3-year period for the purposes of this subsection. The requirements of this subsection are waived if compliance would cause the county road commission to be ineligible for federal revenue under federal law, but only to the extent necessary to make the county road commission eligible for that revenue under federal law. For the purpose of the calculations required by this subsection, the amount expended on urban routes by a county road commission for purposes other than preservation and the amount expended for hard-surfacing of gravel roads on the federal-aid system must be deducted from the total federal revenue distributed to the use of the county road commission. As used in this subsection, "urban routes" means those portions of 2-lane county primary roads within an urban area that have average daily traffic in excess of 15,000. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) A county road commission shall certify to the department on or before the issuance of any bonds or notes issued after July 1, 1983, under 1943 PA 143, MCL 141.251 to 141.254, 1941 PA 205, MCL 252.51 to 252.64, or section 18c or 18d, for purposes other than the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges and purposes other than the purposes specified in subsection (16)(c) that its average annual debt service requirements for all bonds and notes or portions of bonds and notes issued after July 1, 1983, for purposes other than the preservation of highways, roads, streets, and bridges and other than for the purposes specified in subsection (16)(c), including the bond or note to be issued does not exceed 10% of the money returned to the county road commission under this act, less the amounts specified in subsection (16)(a), (b), and (c) during the last completed fiscal year of the county road commission. If the purpose for which the bonds or notes are issued is changed after the issuance of the notes or bonds, the change must be made in a manner that maintains compliance with the certification required by this subsection, as of the date the certificate was originally issued, but the change does not invalidate or otherwise affect the bonds or notes with respect to which the certificate was issued or the obligation to pay debt service on the bonds or notes. A certification under this subsection is conclusive as to the matters stated in the certification for purposes of the validity of bonds and notes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) In each charter county to which funds are returned under this section, the responsibility for road improvement, preservation, and traffic operation work, and the development, construction, or repair of off-road parking facilities and construction or repair of road lighting must be coordinated by a single administrator designated by the county executive who is responsible for and represents the charter county in transactions with the department under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) Not more than 10% per year of all of the money received by and returned to a county from any source for the purposes of this section may be expended for administrative expenses. A county that expends more than 10% for administrative expenses in a year is subject to section 14(5) unless a waiver is granted by the department of treasury. As used in this subsection, "administrative expenses" means expenses that are not assigned including, but not limited to, specific road construction or preservation projects and are often referred to as general or supportive services. Administrative expenses do not include net equipment expense, net capital outlay, debt service principal and interest, and payments to other state or local offices that are assigned, but not limited to, specific road construction projects or preservation activities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) In addition to the financial compliance audits required by law, the department may conduct performance audits and make investigations of the disposition of all state money received by county road commissions, county boards of commissioners, or any other county governmental agency acting as the county road authority, for transportation purposes to determine compliance with the terms and conditions of this act. Performance audits must be conducted according to government auditing standards issued by the United States General Accounting Office. The department shall develop performance audit procedures and reporting requirements sufficient to determine whether money expended under this section was expended in compliance with this act by September 1, 2012 and shall report to the transportation committees of the senate and house of representatives no later than October 1, 2012 on the additional audit procedures and reporting requirements. The department shall provide notice to the county road commission, county board of commissioners, or any other county governmental agency acting as the county road authority, as applicable, of the standards to be used for audits performed under this subsection. The notice must be provided 6 months before the fiscal year in which the audit is conducted. The department shall notify the county road commission, county board of commissioners, or any other county governmental agency acting as the county road authority of any subsequent changes to the standards. County road commissions, county boards of commissioners, or any other county governmental agencies acting as county road authorities, as applicable, shall make available to the department the pertinent records for the audit. Performance audits may be performed at the discretion of the department or on receiving a request from the speaker of the house of representatives or the senate majority leader.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) Of the amounts appropriated for a county primary or local road system under this section, where possible, a county road commission shall secure pavement warranties for full replacement or appropriate repair for contracted construction work on pavement projects whose cost exceeds $2,000,000.00 and projects for new construction or reconstruction undertaken after April 1, 2016, if allowed by the Federal Highway Administration and the department. A county road commission shall submit a proposed warranty program to the department for approval no later than April 1, 2016. If a proposed warranty program submitted under this subsection is approved by the department, the county road commission shall implement the program no later than 1 year after the approval. A county road commission shall include a list of all warranties that were secured under this subsection and indicate whether any of those warranties were redeemed with the report required under section 14(3), and shall also list all pavement projects whose cost exceeds $2,000,000.00 for which a warranty was not secured. The list must include, but is not limited to, all of the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The type of project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The cost or estimated cost of the project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The expected lifespan of the project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Whether or not the project met or is currently meeting its expected lifespan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the project failed to meet or is not meeting its expected lifespan, the cause of the failure and the cost to replace or repair the project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The entity responsible for paying the cost of replacing or repairing the project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(23) Once the asset management plan for a county as described in section 9a has been approved, amounts distributed to a county under this section must be expended toward attainment of the condition goals in the asset management plan and as otherwise required by this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(24) A county road commission may use a portion of the amount returned to the county under this section for the payment of debt service on bonds, notes, or other obligations.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The amount distributed to cities and villages must be returned to the treasurers of the cities and villages in the manner, for the purposes, and under the terms and conditions specified in this section. The amount received by a newly incorporated municipality must be in place of any other direct distribution of money from the Michigan transportation fund. The population of a newly incorporated municipality as determined under this section must be added to the total population of all incorporated cities and villages in this state in computing the amounts to be returned under this section to each municipality in the state. Major street mileage, local street mileage, and equivalent major mileage, if applicable, must be determined by the department before the next month for which distribution is made following the effective date of incorporation of a newly incorporated municipality.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) From the amount available for distribution to cities and villages during each December, an amount equal to 0.7% of the total amount returned to all cities and villages under subsections (3) and (4) during the previous calendar year must be withheld. The amount withheld must be used to partially reimburse cities and villages located in counties that are eligible for snow removal funds under section 12a and that have costs for winter maintenance on major and local streets that are greater than the statewide average. The distributions must be made annually during February and must be calculated separately for the major and local street systems but may be paid in a combined warrant. The distribution to a city or village must be equal to 1/2 of its winter maintenance expenditures after deducting the product of its total earnings under subsections (3) and (4) multiplied by 2 times the average municipal winter maintenance factor. Winter maintenance expenditures must be determined from the street financial reports for the most current fiscal years ending before July 1. A city or village that does not submit a street financial report for the fiscal year ending before July 1 by the subsequent December 31 is ineligible for the winter maintenance payment that is to be based on that street financial report. The department shall determine the average municipal winter maintenance factor annually by dividing the total expenditures of all cities and villages on winter maintenance of streets and highways by the total amount earned by all cities and villages under subsections (3) and (4) during the 12 months. If the sum of the distributions to be made under this subsection exceeds the amount withheld, the distributions to each eligible city and village must be reduced proportionately. If the sum is less than the amount withheld, the balance must be added to the amount available for distribution under subsections (3) and (4) during the next month. The distributions are for use on the major and local street systems respectively and are subject to the same provisions as money returned under subsections (3) and (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Seventy-five percent of the remaining amount to be returned to the cities and villages, after deducting the amounts withheld under subsection (2), must be returned 60% in the same proportion that the population of each bears to the total population of all cities and villages, and 40% in the same proportion that the equivalent major mileage in each bears to the total equivalent major mileage in all cities and villages. The amount returned under this subsection must be used by each city and village for the following purposes in the following order of priority:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For the payment of contributions required to be made by a city or village under the provisions of contracts previously entered into under 1941 PA 205, MCL 252.51 to 252.64, that have been previously pledged for the payment of the principal and interest on bonds issued under that act; or for the payment of the principal and interest upon bonds issued by a city or village under 1952 PA 175, MCL 247.701 to 247.707.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Payment of obligations of the city or village on highway projects undertaken by the city or village jointly with the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For the payment of principal and interest on loans received under section 11(5), to the extent other money has not been made available for that payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, for the preservation, construction, acquisition, and extension of the major street system as defined by this act including the acquisition of a necessary right of way for the system, work incidental to the system, and an appurtenant roadside park or motor parkway, of the city or village and for the payment of the principal and interest on that portion of the city's or village's general obligation bonds that are attributable to the construction or reconstruction of the city's or village's major street system. However, once an asset management plan described in section 9a has been approved, funds shall be used for the preservation, construction, and acquisition of the street system as provided in subsection (16) or for an emergency as described in section 11c. Not more than 5% per year of the money returned to a city or village by this subsection shall be expended for the preservation or acquisition of appurtenant roadside parks and motor parkways. Surplus money may be expended for the development, construction, or repair of off-street parking facilities, and the construction or repair of street lighting, and transfer to the local street system under subsection (6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) For capital outlay projects for equipment and buildings, contributions pledged for the payment of loans and for the payment of contractual debt service requirements for the payment of bonds for the purpose of providing money for capital outlay projects for equipment and buildings necessary to the development and maintenance of the road system so long as amounts allocated under this subdivision are used for transportation purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The remaining amount to be returned to incorporated cities and villages must be expended in each city or village for the preservation, construction, acquisition, and extension of the local street system of the city or village, including the acquisition of a necessary right of way for the system, work incidental to the system, and subject to subsection (5), for the payment of the principal and interest on the portion of the city's or village's general obligation bonds that are attributable to the construction or reconstruction of the city's or village's local street system. However, once an asset management plan described in section 9a has been approved, funds shall be used for the preservation, construction, and acquisition of the street system as provided in subsection (16) or for an emergency as described in section 11c. The amount returned under this subsection must be returned to the cities and villages 60% in the same proportion that the population of each bears to the total population of all incorporated cities and villages in this state, and 40% in the same proportion that the total mileage of the local street system of each bears to the total mileage in the local street systems of all cities and villages of this state. The payment of the principal and interest on bonds issued by a city or village under 1952 PA 175, MCL 247.701 to 247.707, and after that payment, the payment of debt service on loans received under section 11(5), must have priority in the expenditure of money returned under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Money distributed to each city and village for the maintenance and preservation of its local street system under this act represents the total responsibility of this state for local street system support. Money distributed from the Michigan transportation fund must not be expended for construction purposes on city and village local streets except to the extent matched from local revenues including other money returned to a city or village by this state under the state constitution of 1963 and statutes of this state, from money that can be raised by taxation in cities and villages for street purposes within the limitations of the state constitution of 1963 and statutes of this state, from special assessments, or from any other source. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Money returned under this section to a city or village must be expended on the major and local street systems of that city or village. However, the first priority is the major street system. Money returned for expenditure on the major street system must be expended in the priority order provided in subsection (3) except that surplus money may be transferred for preservation of the local street system. Major street money transferred for use on the local street system must not be used for construction but may be used for preservation. A city or village shall not transfer more than 50% of its annual major street funding for the local street system unless it has adopted and is following an asset management process for its major and local street systems and adopts a resolution with a copy to the department setting forth all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A list of the major streets in that city or village.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A statement that the city or village is adequately maintaining its major streets.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The dollar amount of the transfer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The local streets to be funded with the transfer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A statement that the city or village is following an asset management process for its major and local street systems.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A city or village that has not adopted an asset management plan shall obtain the concurrence of the department to transfer more than 50% of its major street funding to its local street system. The department may provide for pilot projects that would allow a city or village that has adopted an asset management plan under subsection (6) to combine their local and major street funds into 1 street fund and to submit a single report to the department on the expenditure of money on the local and major street systems.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Not more than 10% per year of all of the money returned to a city or village from any source for the purposes of this section may be expended for administrative expenses. A city or village that expends more than 10% for administrative expenses in a year is subject to section 14(5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) In each city and village to which money is returned under this section, the responsibility for street preservation and the development, construction, or repair of off-street parking facilities and construction or repair of street lighting shall be coordinated by a single administrator designated by the governing body who shall be responsible for and shall represent the municipality in transactions with the department under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Cities and villages may provide for consolidated street administration. A city or a village may enter into an agreement with other cities or villages, the county road commission, or with the state transportation commission for the performance of street or highway work on a road or street within the limits of the city or village or adjacent to the city or village. The agreement may provide for any of the contracting parties to perform the work contemplated by the contracts including services and acquisition of rights of way, by purchase or condemnation in its own name. The agreement may provide for joint participation in the costs if appropriate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Interest earned on money returned to a city or a village for purposes provided in this section must be credited to the appropriate street fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) In addition to the financial compliance audits required by law, the department may conduct performance audits and make investigations of the disposition of all state money received by cities and villages for transportation purposes to determine compliance with the terms and conditions of this act. Performance audits must be conducted according to government auditing standards issued by the United States General Accounting Office. The department shall develop all performance audit procedures and reporting requirements sufficient to determine whether money expended under this section was expended in compliance with this act by September 1, 2012 and shall report to the transportation committees of the senate and house of representatives no later than October 1, 2012 on the additional audit procedures and reporting requirements. The audit procedures must include a review of the road fund balance of the city or village. The cities and villages shall report their road fund balances by fund balance component. The department shall assist cities and villages to ensure that road fund balances are consistently classified and are in compliance with the audit and reporting requirements of this section. The department shall provide notice to cities and villages of the standards to be used for audits under this subsection prior to the fiscal year in which the audit is conducted. The department shall notify cities and villages of any subsequent changes to the standards. Cities and villages shall make available to the department the pertinent records for the audit. Performance audits may be performed at the discretion of the department or on receiving a request from the speaker of the house of representatives or the senate majority leader.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Of the amounts appropriated for a city or village major or local street system under this section, where possible, a city or village shall secure pavement warranties for full replacement or appropriate repair for contracted construction work on pavement projects whose cost exceeds $2,000,000.00 and projects for new construction or reconstruction undertaken after April 1, 2016 if allowed by the Federal Highway Administration and the department. A city or village shall submit a proposed warranty program to the department for approval no later than February 1, 2017. If a proposed warranty program submitted under this subsection is approved by the department, the city or village shall implement the program no later than 1 year after the approval. A city or village shall include a list of all warranties that were secured under this subsection and indicate whether any of those warranties were redeemed with the report required under section 14(3), and shall also list all pavement projects whose cost exceeds $2,000,000.00 for which a warranty was not secured. The list shall include, but is not limited to, all of the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The type of project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The cost or estimated cost of the project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The expected lifespan of the project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Whether or not the project met or is currently meeting its expected lifespan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the project failed to meet or is not meeting its expected lifespan, the cause of the failure and the cost to replace or repair the project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The entity responsible for paying the cost of replacing or repairing the project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) With the approval of the director of the department, a city may use up to 20% of the amount received by that city under this section for public transit purposes if more than 10,000,000 passengers used public transit within that city during the previous fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) A city or village may use a portion of the amount returned to the city or village under this section for the payment of debt service on bonds, notes, or other obligations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) Once the asset management plan for a city or village as described in section 9a has been approved, amounts distributed to a city or village under this section shall be expended toward attainment of the condition goals in the asset management plan and as otherwise required by this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Administrative expenses" means expenses that are not assigned under this section, including, but not limited to, specific road construction or maintenance projects, and are often referred to as general or supportive services. Administrative expenses do not include net equipment expense, net capital outlay, debt service principal and interest, or payments to other state or local offices that are assigned, but not limited to, specific road construction projects or maintenance activities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Equivalent major mileage" means the sum of 2 times the state trunk line mileage certified by the department as of March 31 of each year, as being within the boundaries of each city and village having a population of 25,000 or more, plus the major street mileage in each city and village, multiplied by the following factor:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) 1.0 for cities and villages of 2,000 or less population.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) 1.1 for cities and villages from 2,001 to 10,000 population.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) 1.2 for cities and villages from 10,001 to 20,000 population.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) 1.3 for cities and villages from 20,001 to 30,000 population.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(xi) 2.0 for cities and villages from 160,001 to 320,000 population.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(xii) For cities over 320,000 population, a factor of 2.1 increased successively by 0.1 for each 160,000 population increment over 320,000.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Population" means the population according to the most recent statewide federal census as certified at the beginning of the state fiscal year, except that, if a municipality has been newly incorporated since completion of the census, the population of the municipality for purposes of the distribution of money before completion of the next census is the population as determined by special federal census, if there is a special federal census, and if not, by the population as determined by the official census in connection with the incorporation, if there is such a census and, if not, by a special state census to be taken at the expense of the municipality by the secretary of state under section 6 of the home rule city act, 1909 PA 279, MCL 117.6.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Road authorities shall mow the right-of-way of a public road in accordance with the requirements prescribed in this section, subject to the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   This section does not apply within the limits of a city or village.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   This section is not mandatory with respect to public road rights-of-way within designated federal aid urban boundaries.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Property owners may mow public road rights-of-way immediately in front of their residences, schools, or businesses.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Mowing shall be 12 feet or to the leading edge of the ditch, whichever is less, adjacent to both shoulders of the roadway to any height at any time. The area between the ditch bottom and the back slopes of the rights-of-way shall be protected from mowing between September 1 and the following July 15 except as permitted in this subsection. Spraying shall be limited to the control of noxious weeds and brush within this area. From July 16 through August 31, mowing may be through the entire right-of-way if needed, including through the ditch bottom, while maintaining not less than 12 inches of grass height from the back of the ditch to the back of the right-of-way and within the median. Between July 16 and the following March 1, mechanical brush and woody stem control may be completed to whatever height is needed to provide control and safety. Up to 50% of all roads shall be designated annually for brush control that includes mowing and may include herbicide treatment during the next growing season.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The mowing standards prescribed in this section shall apply to all medians 70 feet wide or more. Medians 70 feet wide or more shall be maintained as brush-free as possible and with a grass height of at least 12 inches. Twenty-five percent of the medians within a region shall be annually designated for removal or spot spray treatment of unwanted brush and trees. It is the intent of the legislature that the mowing standards prescribed in this section apply to medians 50 or more feet wide 3 years after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   All mowing of the back slope and wide median areas beyond the 12-foot width from the road edge shall be performed so as to ensure a minimum of 12 inches of grass remains by September 1 each year, except in those zones designated for brush control. Areas of brush within the right-of-way shall be mowed back to prevent brush from becoming established within the right-of-way. Brush or tree stumps shall be spot treated with herbicide, as needed, for long-term control.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A right-of-way may be mowed as necessary to maintain public health and safety.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The road authority shall not provide compensation for any mowing or spraying that does not comply with this section.</DIV>

The resolution shall contain an irrevocable appropriation providing for the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds from the money received or to be received by the county road commission from the Michigan transportation fund, except to the extent the money has been pledged by contract in accordance with 1941 PA 205, MCL 252.51 to 252.64, before July 1, 1957, for the construction or financing of limited access highways, and except to the extent the moneys have been pledged before July 1, 1957, for the payment of notes issued under 1943 PA 143, MCL 141.251 to 141.254. A contractual pledge made before July 1, 1957, in accordance with the provisions of 1941 PA 205, MCL 252.51 to 252.64, and a pledge made before July 1, 1957, for the payment of promissory notes under 1943 PA 143, MCL 141.251 to 141.254, shall have and retain its priority of lien or charge against the money distributed by law to the county road commission from the Michigan transportation fund, as contemplated by those acts, and as provided in the contract or resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds or notes under those acts. A pledge made after June 30, 1957, by a county road commission under 1941 PA 205, MCL 252.51 to 252.64, or 1943 PA 143, MCL 141.251 to 141.254, shall have equal standing and priority with a pledge made after June 30, 1957, by the county road commission under this act.

Bonds may be issued under this section as separate issues or series with different dates of issuance but the aggregate of the bonds shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this act. As additional security for the payment of the bonds, a county, upon adoption of a resolution by a majority of the members of its county board of commissioners, may agree on behalf of the county that if the funds pledged for the payment of the bonds are at any time insufficient to pay the principal and interest on the bonds as the same become due, the county treasurer shall be obligated to advance sufficient money from the general fund of the county to make up the deficiency, and reimbursement shall be made from the first subsequent revenues received by the county road commission from the Michigan transportation fund not pledged or required to be set aside and used for the payment of the principal and interest on bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The total annual amount that may be pledged by a county road commission for the payment of principal and interest on bonds issued pursuant to this section, or the payment of contributions as required by a contract entered into in accordance with section 18d, which contributions are pledged for the payment of bonds, together with total maximum debt service requirements for payment of notes issued under 1943 PA 143, MCL 141.251 to 141.254, shall not exceed 50% of the total amount received by the county road commission from the Michigan transportation fund during the last completed fiscal year ending on June 30 before the issuance of a bond or note or the execution of a contract.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>It is the intent of the legislature to establish this state's responsibility for the enhancement and enjoyment of Michigan's scenic, recreational, and historic resources along its roadside by identifying and designating certain portions of the state trunk line highway system as Pure Michigan byways.

</P>
<P>Sec. 3.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Certain portions of the state trunkline highway system are so uniquely endowed by natural aesthetic, ecological, environmental, and cultural amenities immediately adjacent to the roadside that their use by a larger percentage of the motoring public, particularly during the recreational season, is for the experience of traveling the road rather than as a route to a destination. Because of the immediate proximity of these features, roads may possess characteristics such as the following: pavement width of 16 to 20 feet, shoulders as narrow as 2 feet with trees immediately adjacent, curves that restrict maximum legal speeds, hills, steep side slopes, and narrow rights-of-way. The improvement philosophy for these roads is to maintain the essential elements of the road and the area immediately surrounding the road that create its unique character.</DIV>
