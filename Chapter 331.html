<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The legislative bodies of the cities, villages, and townships belonging to the hospital authority may annually raise by a tax, to be levied on the taxable property within their respective jurisdictions, a sum of money to be used to assist in planning, promoting, acquiring, constructing, improving, enlarging, extending, owning, maintaining, and operating community hospitals authorized by this act. The annual tax authorized in this section shall not exceed 4/10 of 1 mill of the state equalized valuation on each dollar of assessed valuation in each city, village, or township in the authority. The treasurer of any city, village, or township who collects the tax authorized by this section shall also pay to the authority its proportionate share of reimbursement payments under the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921. In addition, an annual tax at a rate not to exceed 2 mills may be levied for not more than 10 years for capital improvements when authorized at a general or special election and approved by a majority vote of the total qualified electors voting on the question in all member cities, villages, and townships. The hospital authority board may initiate a proceeding for the additional tax by resolution of the hospital authority board which shall set forth the amount of the tax, not to exceed 2 mills, and shall set a date of election which shall be not less than 60 days after the adoption of the resolution. The secretary of the authority shall within 5 days after the adoption of the resolution transmit a certified copy of the resolution to the clerk of each city, village, or township which is a member of the authority. The clerk of each member city, village, or township shall take the steps necessary to provide for an election pursuant to the resolution passed at which election the question of the additional tax shall be submitted. The election shall be conducted in the same manner as elections are required to be conducted in the member cities, villages, or townships under the provisions of the general election law. When a part or all of a village belonging to the authority is located in a township belonging to the authority, the township election shall include that part of the village located in it and the village shall not be required to hold an election except in that portion of the village not located in the township belonging to the authority. The election in each member city, village, and township shall be canvassed in the manner required by the general election law and the results of the election shall be certified to the hospital authority board within 5 days after the date of the election. The hospital authority board shall compile and tabulate the vote as received from the member cities, villages, and townships and certify the election by resolution upon the records of the authority, and a majority of the total valid votes cast in the election voting "yes" on the question submitted shall constitute an approval. A special election called pursuant to this section shall not be included in a statutory or charter limitation as to the number of special elections to be called within a period of time. A previous election held under this act is not invalid if the election was approved by majority of the total valid votes cast in a proper election. The hospital authority calling an election for a date other than a primary, general, or special election held within the cities, villages, or townships forming the hospital authority shall pay the costs of the election. If the election is held at the same time as a primary, general, or special election held within the cities, villages, or townships forming the hospital authority, the hospital authority shall pay its proportionate share of the costs incurred in holding the election.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 7.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided in section 6, by April 1 of each year, the hospital board shall cause a balanced budget to be prepared containing an itemized statement of the estimated current expenses and the expenses for capital outlay, including the amount necessary to pay the principal and interest of any outstanding bonds or other obligations of the authority maturing before the time of the following year's tax collection or which have previously matured and are unpaid, and an estimate of the revenue of the hospital authority from all sources for the ensuing fiscal year. The board shall publish notice of a public hearing on the budget stating the time and place. Notice of hearing shall be furnished the legislative body of each city, village, or township participating in the hospital authority.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   After the public hearing, the board shall adopt the budget as shall be considered necessary and shall ascertain what amount is required to be raised by taxation from the several cities, townships, and villages to meet their respective shares of the amount of the budget in excess of the estimated other revenues. The share of each city, village, and township shall be determined on the basis of their respective valuations as finally equalized. The assessed valuation of a township for the purpose shall be exclusive of the property within a village which, as a corporate entity, is a member of the authority, and the assessed valuation of a member village shall be computed pursuant to the township assessment roll so as to afford a uniform assessment basis. A member township containing in whole or in part a member village shall levy taxes under this act only against property located outside the village. The board shall certify to each participating city, township, and village the amount to be raised by them and the respective cities, townships, and villages shall include those amounts in their next ensuing budgets, and shall pay the amount so certified from funds they have available or from the proceeds of a tax which they are authorized to levy, in an amount sufficient therefor, but not exceeding the tax limitation provided in this act exclusive of any amount voted for capital improvements under section 4 or necessary to pay principal and interest on bonds issued under section 8b. A village located in a township that is also a member of the authority, by agreement with the township, may have the township include the village property in a tax assessment under this act, collect the money assessed, and pay it to the village for payment of its share to the authority. Payment of the sums certified shall be due and payable to the hospital authority 120 days after the date on which local taxes become due and payable in cities, villages, and townships participating in the hospital authority except that when a township collects a village portion, the amount due from the village shall not be due to the authority until the township portion is due. Each city, township, and village shall be liable for the amount certified.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The board shall also render to each participating city, township, and village on each July 1 and January 1 a certified report pertaining to the operation of the hospital. Each report shall state the condition of the finances, the amount of money expended, the money received from all sources, the money owing to the board for hospital and medical services, and other information as the board may consider expedient. The board shall also file a copy of the report with the department of treasury together with other information as the department of treasury may require.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Within 30 days after the formation of a new hospital authority, and annually on July 1 thereafter, the hospital board shall file with the secretary of state a report as the secretary of state may require, including the date of formation, the names of the member communities, and other information the secretary of state may require.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 8c.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Unless a referendum petition is filed as provided in this act, a hospital authority board by ordinance adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of its members may authorize and issue bonds and provide for such matters necessary or desirable with respect thereto and to insure the security of any bonds issued hereunder without submitting the question thereof to the electors of the authority. Bonds shall be authorized by the hospital authority board by resolution. If, within 60 days from the publication of a notice of intent to issue the bonds, a petition, signed by not less than 10% or 15,000 of the registered electors, whichever is less, residing within the member cities, villages and townships of the authority, shall have been filed with the secretary of the authority requesting a referendum election upon the question of the issuance of the bonds, then the same shall not be issued unless the issuance thereof shall have been approved by a majority of the electors of the authority member cities, villages and townships qualified to vote and voting thereon at a general or special election. The notice shall be directed to the electors and tax payers of the authority and of the member cities, villages and townships and other interested parties, and shall be published in a newspaper which has general circulation in the territory included in the authority, and which is determined by the hospital authority board to be the newspaper reaching the largest number of persons to whom the notice is directed and shall state the maximum amount of bonds to be issued, the purpose thereof, source of payment and right of referendum thereon, and such other information as the hospital authority board shall determine to be necessary to adequately inform the electors and tax payers of the nature of the issue. If a referendum petition is filed with the secretary of the authority, the hospital authority board shall adopt a resolution establishing the date of the referendum election which shall be not less than 60 days after the adoption of such resolution. The secretary of the authority shall, within 5 days after the adoption of such resolution, transmit a certified copy thereof to the clerk of each city, village or township which is a member of the authority. The clerk of each member city, village or township shall forthwith take all steps necessary to provide for an election in accordance with the resolution so passed at which election the question of issuing the bonds shall be submitted. The election shall be conducted in the same manner as elections are required to be conducted in the member cities, villages or townships under the provisions of the general election law. Where any part or all of a village belonging to the authority is located in a township belonging to the authority, the township election shall include that part of the village located in it and the village shall not be required to hold such an election except in that portion of the village not located in the township belonging to the authority. The election in each member city, village and township shall be canvassed in the manner required by the general election law and the results thereof shall be certified to the hospital authority board within 5 days after the date of the election. The hospital authority board shall compile and tabulate the vote as received from the member cities, villages and townships and certify the election by resolution upon the records of the authority, and a majority of the total valid votes cast in the referendum election voting "yes" on the question submitted shall constitute an approval. Any special election called in accordance with this section shall not be included in any statutory or charter limitation as to the number of special elections to be called within any period of time. Signatures on any referendum petition shall be verified by some person or persons, under oath, as to actual signatures of the persons whose names are affixed thereto. Each referendum petition shall state the city, village or township in which it is circulated and be signed by registered electors from such member city, village or township, and any signatures on the petition from a different city, village or township shall be invalid. The secretary of the authority shall deliver the petitions to the clerks of the member cities, villages and townships who shall verify the same against their registration records and the secretary of the authority shall reject signatures of those persons signing the petition who are not registered electors of the member city, village or township of the authority. The number of registered electors in the member cities, villages and townships of the authority shall be determined by the cities', villages' and townships' registration books. A resolution adopted pursuant to this act shall become effective upon its adoption unless otherwise specified therein. The resolution shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting of the hospital authority board as soon as practicable after its passage, which recording shall be authenticated by the signatures of the chairman and secretary of the hospital authority board. The resolution shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation within the boundaries of the hospital authority. This section constitutes the sole requirements with respect to the adoption and publication of the resolution.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds shall state a brief description of the contemplated project, the estimated cost thereof, the estimated period of usefulness thereof, and the amount and maximum rate of interest and time of payment of the bonds. The bonds shall be serial bonds payable either semiannually or annually with the first installment not more than 5 years from the date thereof and the last installment not longer than the estimated period of usefulness of the project for which the bonds are issued. The bonds shall bear interest payable semiannually, except that the first coupon may be for any number of months not exceeding 10.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   There shall be created in the authorizing resolution a lien, by this act made a statutory lien upon all net revenues, including as a part thereof, the assessments against a member city, township, or village as provided in this act pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds, to and in favor of the holders of the bonds and the interest coupons pertaining thereto. This lien shall be a first lien upon the revenues and amounts pledged, except where a prior lien exists, then the new lien shall be subject thereto.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The revenues and amounts so pledged shall be and remain subject to the statutory lien until the payment in full of the principal of and interest upon the bonds. The holder or holders of bonds representing in the aggregate not less than 20% of the entire issue then outstanding may by suit, action, or other proceeding protect and enforce the statutory lien and enforce and compel the performance of all duties of the officials of the hospital authority, including the fixing of sufficient rates, the collection of revenues, the proper segregation of revenues, the proper application thereof, and the imposition and collection of assessments against a member city, township, or village assessed in accordance with this act. However, the statutory lien shall not be construed to give the holders or owners of a bond or coupon authority to compel the sale of any of the hospitals the revenues of which are pledged.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a payment of principal or interest on the bonds is in default, a court having jurisdiction in any proper action may appoint a receiver to administer and operate on behalf of the hospital authority, under direction of the court, any hospital the revenues of which are pledged to the payment of principal and interest. With the approval of the court the receiver may fix and charge rates and collect revenues sufficient to provide for the payment of bonds or other obligations outstanding against the revenues of the hospital, and for the payment of operating and maintenance expenses, and to apply the income and revenues of the hospital in conformity with this act, the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds, and in accordance with orders of the court.</DIV>

An unexpended balance of the proceeds from the sale of the bonds remaining after completion of the project for which issued, may, to the extent of 15% of the amount of the issue, be used for the improvement or enlargement of hospitals of the hospital authority or may be used to defray the cost of additional hospitals of the hospital authority, if approved by the department of treasury. A remaining balance shall be paid immediately into the bond and interest redemption fund and used only for the redemption or purchase, at no more than the fair market value, of outstanding bonds the issue from which the proceeds were derived.

The reasonable cost and value of a service rendered to a public agency, including a member city, township, or village, shall be paid for as the service accrues from its current funds and the charges when so paid shall be accounted for in the same manner as other revenues of the hospitals.

The rates shall be sufficient to provide for the payment of the expenses of administration, operation, and maintenance of the hospital as may be necessary to preserve the same in good repair and working order. The rates shall be sufficient to provide for the payment of principal of and interest on the bonds payable from the revenues of the hospital, as, and when, the same become due and payable, taking into account, however, amounts assessed or to be assessed against a member city, township, or village as provided in this act, and for the creation of any reserve for the payment of principal and interest as required in the resolution.

The rates shall be fixed and revised from time to time by the hospital authority board so as to produce these amounts, and the hospital authority board shall covenant and agree in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, and on the face of each bond, to maintain at all times such rates for services furnished by such hospitals as shall be sufficient to provide for the foregoing. Rates charged for the services furnished by a hospital, the revenues of which are pledged for the payment of bonds under this act, shall not be subject to approval by any state, bureau, board, commission, or other like instrumentality or agency thereof.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Out of the revenues in the receiving fund a sum sufficient shall be set aside to provide for the payment for the next succeeding period of all current expenses of administration, operation, and maintenance as may be necessary to preserve the hospitals, the revenues of which are pledged for the payment of bonds in good repair and working order. This fund shall be designated "operation and maintenance fund".</DIV>

This fund shall be designated "bond and interest redemption fund".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If the revenues of an operating year over and above those necessary for the operation and maintenance fund are insufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds maturing in the operating year, then an additional amount to pay the principal and interest shall be set aside out of the revenues of the next succeeding operating year, after the setting aside for the operation and maintenance fund. In respect to the allocation and use of moneys in the bond and interest redemption fund, due recognition shall be given as to priority rights, if any, between different issues or series of outstanding bonds. The hospital authority may provide by resolution that a reasonable excess amount shall be set aside in the bond and interest redemption fund to produce and provide a reserve to meet any possible future deficiencies therein.</DIV>

If moneys in the receiving fund are insufficient to provide for the current requirements of the operation and maintenance fund or the bond and interest redemption fund, any moneys or securities in other funds established by the resolution authorizing the bonds shall be transferred first to the operation and maintenance fund and second to the bond and interest redemption fund to the extent of any deficits therein.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) For purposes of a hospital authority established under this act, the hospital board may purchase, lease, accept by gift or devise, or condemn private property. The hospital board may sell, exchange or otherwise transfer, lease, hold, manage, and control a property, asset, or hospital owned by the hospital board. Subject to subsections (2), (14), and (19), the sale, exchange, transfer, or lease of a property, asset, or hospital must be for its market value and the money received from that sale, exchange, transfer, or lease must be retained by the hospital authority. If acquired by condemnation, 1911 PA 149, MCL 213.21 to 213.25, and the uniform condemnation procedures act, 1980 PA 87, MCL 213.51 to 213.75, apply.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (19), a hospital authority whose jurisdiction has a member population of fewer than 300,000 may, by resolution, provide for the sale, lease, or other transfer of a hospital owned by the hospital board, under this subsection and subsections (3) to (12). The resolution must include a copy of the document proposed to effect the sale, lease, or other transfer. If a hospital authority passes a resolution described in this subsection, the hospital authority also shall provide by resolution for a public vote of the electors at large of all cities, villages, and townships in the hospital authority on the question of the sale, lease, or other transfer of the hospital. The election must be conducted in the same manner as provided in section 4 for the approval of an additional tax for capital improvements. If the sale, lease, or other transfer of the hospital is approved by a majority of the voters, the hospital board may sell, lease, or otherwise transfer a hospital owned by the hospital board on terms and conditions considered reasonable by the hospital board, including a sale, lease, or other transfer for no or nominal monetary consideration, subject to subsections (6) to (8) and all of the following conditions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The sale, lease, or other transfer from the hospital authority must be to a nonprofit corporation established under the nonprofit corporation act, 1982 PA 162, MCL 450.2101 to 450.3192, and organized specifically for the ownership and operation of the hospital. The nonprofit corporation shall meet both of the following requirements:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) At the time of the sale, lease, or other transfer or within 6 months after the date of the sale, lease, or other transfer, be an entity exempt from federal income tax under section 501(c) of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 501, or a comparable successor provision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) At the time of the sale, lease, or other transfer from the hospital authority, the majority of the members of the board of directors of the nonprofit corporation are also members of the board of the hospital authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) At the time of the sale, lease, or other transfer from the hospital authority, the articles of incorporation of the nonprofit corporation and the contractual arrangements between the hospital authority and the nonprofit corporation must require that the nonprofit corporation operate the hospital as a nonprofit community hospital open to the general public that serves the general population residing in the service area of the hospital authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) At the time of the sale, lease, or other transfer from the hospital authority, the articles of incorporation of the nonprofit corporation and the contractual arrangements between the hospital authority and the nonprofit corporation must require that the nonprofit corporation shall not sell, lease, or otherwise transfer the hospital without the express consent of the hospital authority. If the sale, lease, or other transfer of the hospital by the nonprofit corporation is approved by the hospital authority, the nonprofit corporation may sell, lease, or otherwise transfer the hospital on terms and conditions considered reasonable by the nonprofit corporation, including a sale, lease, or other transfer for no or nominal monetary consideration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If the hospital authority has ever levied an additional tax for capital improvements under section 4, the hospital authority shall pay back to each member unit of the hospital authority, on terms and conditions as agreed upon by the hospital board and each member unit, an amount equal to all taxes for capital improvement collected within the 60 months immediately preceding the sale, lease, or other transfer with respect to property located in the member unit, and any remaining uncollected portion of the tax levy must not then be collected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) As used in subsection (2), "hospital" includes all property, real and personal, tangible and intangible, including without limitation cash and accounts receivable, used in the operation and management of the hospital.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If self-liquidating bonds have been issued by the hospital authority under this act, and if the bonds are outstanding, a lease of a hospital under subsection (2), with or without a transfer to the nonprofit corporation at the expiration of the lease term and with or without monetary consideration, is not a violation of this act or of any bond resolution or ordinance adopted under this act if the lease does all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Requires the lessee to pay rent to the hospital authority in an amount sufficient to pay the principal and interest obligations of the bonds as they become due.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Requires the lessee to maintain the various bond funds as required by this act and by the bond resolution or ordinance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Provides for the continuation of the lien created by this act and by the bond resolution or ordinance on the net revenues of the hospital.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Requires the lessee to operate the hospital in a manner consistent with the bond resolution or ordinance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If self-liquidating bonds have been issued by the hospital authority under this act, and if the bonds are outstanding, a sale of a hospital under subsection (2) is not a violation of this act or of any bond resolution or ordinance adopted under this act if all of the following conditions are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The outstanding bonds are defeased.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Defeasance of the existing bonded indebtedness is accomplished by depositing sufficient cash or United States treasury obligations, or both, in escrow in an amount sufficient, including interest to be earned on the funds and obligations placed in escrow, to provide for payment of all interest, principal, and premium, if any, when and as due on the outstanding bonds, including final payment. As used in this subdivision, "final payment" means the final payment due at the maturity of the bonds or on the redemption of the bonds before maturity on a date on which the bonds are callable for redemption if irrevocable arrangements have been made to call the bonds for redemption on that date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The contract of sale contains provisions implementing this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Subject to subsection (9), if a hospital authority passes a resolution providing for an election as provided in subsection (2), the legislative body of a city, village, or township participating in the hospital authority may, within 90 days after the date the resolution is passed by the hospital authority, pass a resolution to withdraw from membership in the authority. If the resolution to withdraw as a member of the authority is passed by the legislative body, the election under subsection (2) must not be held unless a majority of the hospital authority board concurs in the withdrawal of that member unit. If the board concurs in the withdrawal, the withdrawal is effective on the date of the sale, lease, or other transfer of the hospital after the election under subsection (2). After the effective date of the withdrawal, the withdrawing member unit is not subject to any tax levy or other request for funds made by the hospital authority under this act or otherwise, and is not entitled to any of the assets of the hospital authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Subject to subsection (9) and except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if a hospital authority passes a resolution providing for an election under subsection (2), the legislative body of a city, village, or township participating in the hospital authority may, within 90 days after the date the resolution is passed by the hospital authority, provide by resolution for a public vote of the electors of the city, village, or township on the question of the withdrawal of that unit from membership in the hospital authority. The election must be held at the same time as the at large election held under subsection (2) and conducted in the same manner as provided in section 4 for the approval of an additional tax for capital improvements. If an election is called by a member unit under this subsection, its vote is a separate vote for that unit on the question of withdrawal from the hospital authority. However, an election under this subsection or under subsection (2) must not be conducted unless the hospital board has by majority vote consented to the withdrawal of the member unit that has resolved to hold an election on the question of withdrawal from the authority under this subsection. If the board concurs in the withdrawal, the withdrawal is effective on the date of the sale, lease, or other transfer of the hospital after the election under subsection (2). After the effective date of the withdrawal, the withdrawing member unit is not subject to any tax levy or other request for funds made by the hospital authority under this act or otherwise, and is not entitled to any of the assets of the hospital authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Subject to subsection (9) and except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if a hospital authority passes a resolution providing for an election under subsection (2), the electors of a city, village, or township participating in the hospital authority may, by petition signed by a number of qualified and registered electors residing within the city, village, or township equal to not less than 5% of the number of votes cast by the qualified and registered electors in that city, village, or township for secretary of state at the last general election in which a secretary of state was elected, require a public vote of the electors in that city, village, or township on the question of the withdrawal of that unit from membership in the hospital authority. The petitions must be submitted to the clerk of the city, village, or township within 90 days after the passage of the resolution by the hospital authority providing for an election under subsection (2). If a sufficient number of signatures are submitted, the clerk of the city, village, or township shall take the steps necessary to provide for an election. The election must be held at the same time as the at large election held under subsection (2) and conducted in the same manner as provided in section 4 for the approval of an additional tax for capital improvements. If an election is required in a member unit under this subsection, its vote is a separate vote for that unit on the question of withdrawal from the hospital authority. However, an election under this subsection or under subsection (2) must not be conducted unless by a majority vote the hospital board has consented to the withdrawal of the member unit. If the board concurs in the withdrawal, the withdrawal is effective on the date of the sale, lease, or other transfer of the hospital after the election under subsection (2). After the effective date of the withdrawal, the withdrawing member unit is not subject to any tax levy or other request for funds made by the hospital authority under this act or otherwise, and is not entitled to any of the assets of the hospital authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If, at the election held under subsection (2), a majority of the electors at large do not vote to approve the sale, lease, or other transfer of the hospital to a nonprofit corporation, a resolution passed under subsection (6) or an election held under subsection (7) or (8) to withdraw a city, village, or township from participation in the hospital authority is void.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) An election held under subsection (8) takes precedence over a resolution passed under subsection (6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) For a lease or other transfer of a hospital under subsection (2), the total bonded indebtedness of the hospital after the lease or transfer must not be increased so as to exceed 60% of the total asset value of the hospital without a majority vote of the members serving on the hospital authority board. As used in this subsection and subsection (12), "total asset value" means the total value of the various assets of the hospital, including assets to be constructed or acquired by means of the additional proposed bonded indebtedness, as shown on an audited financial statement that includes all bonded indebtedness of the hospital.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) For a lease or other transfer of a hospital under subsection (2), the total bonded indebtedness of the hospital after the lease or transfer must not be increased so as to exceed 80% of the total asset value of the hospital unless authorized at a general or special election and approved by a majority vote of the total qualified and registered electors voting on the question in each city, village, and township participating in the hospital authority. The election must be conducted in the same manner as provided in section 4 for the approval of an additional tax for capital improvements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) On the sale, lease, or other transfer of a hospital under this section, the nonprofit corporation or subsequent profit entity shall assume and is bound by any existing labor agreement applicable to the hospital, for the remainder of the term of the agreement. A representative of the employees or a group of employees who is entitled to represent the employees or group of employees under 1947 PA 336, MCL 423.201 to 423.217, shall continue to be the representative of the employees or group of employees if the employees become employees of the nonprofit corporation or subsequent profit entity. This subsection does not limit the rights of the hospital employees, under applicable law, to assert that a bargaining representative protected by this subsection is no longer the representative of the employees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) A hospital authority whose jurisdiction has a member population of more than 300,000 may, by resolution adopted by a majority vote of the hospital board, provide for the sale, lease, or other transfer of a hospital owned by the hospital board on any terms and conditions considered reasonable by the hospital board, including sale, lease, or other transfer for no or nominal monetary consideration, subject to all of the following terms and conditions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The sale, lease, or other transfer is to a nonprofit corporation established under the nonprofit corporation act, 1982 PA 162, MCL 450.2101 to 450.3192, and organized specifically for the ownership and operation of the hospital. The nonprofit corporation shall at the time of the sale, lease, or other transfer or within 6 months after the date of the sale, lease, or other transfer, be an entity exempt from federal income tax under section 501(c) of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 501, or a comparable successor provision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The articles of incorporation of the nonprofit corporation and the contractual arrangements between the hospital authority and the nonprofit corporation must at all times require that the nonprofit corporation operate the hospital as a nonprofit community health facility open to the general public that serves the general population residing in the service area of the hospital authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The articles of incorporation of the nonprofit corporation and the contractual arrangements between the hospital authority and the nonprofit corporation must at all times require that the nonprofit corporation shall not sell all of the transferred assets without the express consent of the hospital authority and the approval by a majority of the voters in an election conducted in the same manner as provided in section 4 for the approval of an additional tax for capital improvements. If all of the transferred assets are sold under this subdivision, the sale must be for market value and the proceeds of the transaction must be turned over to the hospital authority and used for health care needs within the service area of the hospital authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The articles of incorporation of the nonprofit corporation and the contractual arrangements between the hospital authority and the nonprofit corporation must at all times require that the nonprofit corporation adopt and carry out policies designed to ensure that the hospital complies with the requirement of section 20201(2)(a) of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.20201, that patients not be denied appropriate care on the basis of source of payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) As used in subsection (14), "hospital" includes all property, real and personal, tangible and intangible, including without limitation cash, accounts receivable, and pension reserves used in the operation and management of 1 or more hospitals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) If self-liquidating bonds have been issued by the hospital authority under this act, and if the bonds are outstanding, a sale, lease, or other transfer of a hospital under subsection (14) is not a violation of this act or of any bond resolution or ordinance adopted under this act if all of the following conditions are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The outstanding bonds are defeased.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Defeasance of the existing bonded indebtedness is accomplished by depositing sufficient cash or United States treasury obligations, or both, in escrow in an amount sufficient, including interest to be earned on the funds and obligations placed in escrow, to provide for payment of all interest, principal, and premium, if any, when and as due on the outstanding bonds, including final payment. As used in this subdivision, "final payment" means the final payment due at the maturity of the bonds or on redemption of the bonds before maturity on a date on which the bonds are callable for redemption if irrevocable arrangements have been made to call the bonds for redemption on that date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) If a hospital authority passes a resolution providing for the sale, lease, or other transfer of a hospital under subsection (14), the legislative body of a city, village, or township participating in the hospital authority may, within 60 days after the resolution is passed by the hospital authority, pass a resolution to withdraw from membership in the authority. If a legislative body of a member city, village, or township in the authority passes a resolution to withdraw under this subsection, the resolution adopted by the hospital authority under subsection (14) is not effective until a majority of the hospital authority board concurs in the withdrawal of that city, village, or township. However, if the sale, lease, or other transfer of the hospital is not carried out, the resolution to withdraw and the hospital authority's resolution of concurrence in the withdrawal are void.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) On the sale, lease, or other transfer of a hospital under subsection (14), the nonprofit corporation shall assume and is bound by any existing labor agreement applicable to the hospital, for the remainder of the term of the agreement. A representative of the employees or a group of employees under 1947 PA 336, MCL 423.201 to 423.217, shall continue to be the representative of the employees or group of employees when the employees become employees of the nonprofit corporation or subsequent profit entity.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Refunding bonds of an authority created or incorporated under this act, issued pursuant to section 14(2) or 32, may be issued in 1 or more series, to refund any series of bonds or notes, in whole or in part, issued by that authority, issued by any other authority created or incorporated under this act, or issued for the benefit of a hospital by an economic development corporation incorporated pursuant to the economic development corporations act, Act No. 338 of the Public Acts of 1974, being sections 125.1601 to 125.1636, or in the case of the state authority by an entity for the benefit of a hospital, whether the bonds to be refunded have or have not matured, are or are not redeemable on the date of the issuance of the refunding bonds, or are or are not subject to redemption prior to maturity. The bonds may be issued partly to refund bonds and partly for any other purpose authorized by this act. Refunding bonds shall not be issued to refund bonds that do not mature or will not be redeemed pursuant to the plan of refunding within 40 years after the date of issuance of the refunding bonds. The refunding bonds may be issued in a principal amount greater than the principal amount of the bonds to be refunded, as may be necessary to effect the refunding pursuant to the plan of refunding. Refunding bonds shall not be issued unless the authority issuing the bonds is reasonably satisfied that the hospital facility and other revenues pledged will produce sufficient revenues to meet the principal and interest on the refunding bonds, other costs, expenses, and charges in connection with the issuance of the refunding bonds, and the charges or obligations of the hospital which may be prior to or equal to the refunding bonds promptly as they become due; and that the hospital is otherwise soundly financed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Refunding bonds may be issued for any 1 or more of the following purposes:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   To reduce debt service costs on the basis of the total amount of debt service to be paid on the refunding bonds as compared with the total amount of debt service that would be required to be paid on the bonds to be refunded should the refunding not occur.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   To reduce debt service costs on the basis of the present value of debt service to be paid on the refunding bonds as compared with the present value of debt service that would be required to be paid on the bonds to be refunded should the refunding not occur.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   To produce a repayment schedule on the refunding bonds more favorable to the hospital than the repayment schedule on the bonds to be refunded.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   To eliminate restrictions or requirements determined by the authority to be excessively burdensome to the hospital.</DIV>

On the first day of July of each year the secretary of the board of the sanatorium on the approved list, shall report under oath to the department of community health, the character of the work done and the treatment given, the number and names of the persons employed and patients treated and on that date remaining in the sanatorium, the amount contributed by the county or counties for the support of the sanatorium, and such other matters as may be required by the department of community health. Upon the receipt of the report, if it appears that the sanatorium has been maintained in a satisfactory manner, the director of the department of community health shall make a certificate to that effect, together with the cost of maintenance for the year and the amount actually contributed by each county, and file it with the state treasurer. Upon receiving the certificate the state treasurer shall draw his or her warrant payable to the treasurer of each county contributing toward the maintenance of the sanatorium, for a sum equal to 1/2 the amount actually contributed by that county for the support of the sanatorium for the preceding year.

A county public hospital shall not be considered to be a corporation incorporated and existing under this act upon the expiration of the 90-day period if, within the 90-day period, the county board of commissioners of the county in which the county public hospital is located passes a resolution prohibiting incorporation of the county public hospital under this act. Any such resolution shall be effective for not longer than 12 months after the date of passage. Before the expiration of the 12-month period, and annually thereafter, the county board of commissioners may pass a succeeding resolution prohibiting the incorporation of the county public hospital under this act. If the county board of commissioners fails to pass a succeeding resolution before the expiration of a 12-month period, the county public hospital automatically shall be incorporated under this act. The county board of commissioners of the county may at any time after the effective date of this act adopt articles of incorporation for the corporation in accordance with section 206. Until such time as any such articles of incorporation are effective, the provisions of this act shall be considered to constitute the articles of incorporation of the corporation. Unless and until articles of incorporation providing different numbers of trustees or terms of office are effective, corporations governed by Act No. 350 of the Public Acts of 1913 on the effective date of this act shall have a board of 9 trustees serving 6-year terms, and corporations governed by Act No. 109 of the Public Acts of 1945 on the effective date of this act shall have a board of 5 trustees serving 3-year terms.</DIV>

All actions taken by its board of hospital trustees in good faith prior to the effective date of this act shall be validated, ratified, and confirmed, provided the county public hospital files a notice of its intention to utilize this subsection with the county board of commissioners and the county clerk within 90 days after the effective date of this act.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Corporation obligations shall be authorized by resolution adopted by a majority vote of the members serving on the board of trustees of the corporation or the subsidiary board of the subsidiary corporation issuing the corporation obligations. However, the resolution shall not take effect until issuance of the corporation obligations has been approved by a majority vote of the members serving on the county board of commissioners, city council, or village council and, in the case of issuance of corporation obligations by a subsidiary corporation, also by a majority vote of the members serving on the board of trustees of its parent corporation. Approval of issuance of corporation obligations by the county board of commissioners, city council, or village council and, if applicable, by the board of trustees of the parent corporation, may take place before or after adoption of the resolution authorizing issuance by the issuing corporation or subsidiary corporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Corporation obligations shall be dated, have the maturities, bear interest at the times and the rates, be in the denominations, be in the form, either coupon or registered or both and either certificate or book entry, carry the registration privileges, be executed in the manner, be payable in the medium of payment, at the place or places and be subject to the terms of redemption and other terms as the resolution provides. Corporation obligations may be sold and remarketed by the corporation or subsidiary corporation or by an authorized officer or agent of the corporation or subsidiary corporation, at public or private sale, at the price or prices, the interest rates, and the maturities as the corporation or subsidiary corporation or an authorized officer or agent of the corporation or subsidiary corporation determines in accordance with limits established by the corporation or subsidiary corporation. The corporation or subsidiary corporation may authorize rates of interest that are variable by reference to 1 or more interest rate indices designated by the corporation or subsidiary corporation or to the rate or rates of interest borne by 1 or more series of obligations of the state or the United States, or to a rate or rates of interest announced by the bank or savings and loan association organized under the laws of the United States or any state as the corporation or subsidiary corporation may designate. The corporation obligations may be sold at a discount and at an interest rate or rates that may be varied by an authorized officer or agent of the corporation or subsidiary corporation within the limits established by the corporation or subsidiary corporation as provided in the resolution. Corporation obligations shall not be sold at a price that would make the interest costs on the money borrowed exceed the maximum interest rate then permitted by the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Is or was a trustee, officer, or employee of the corporation or the subsidiary corporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Served as a member of a committee of the medical staff or as a member or officer of a department or other administrative unit of a health care facility of a corporation or subsidiary corporation charged with responsibility for reviewing the professional qualifications of applicants for employment, medical staff membership, or clinical privileges, for establishing, administering, or reviewing the professional standards applicable to health services provided by the corporation or subsidiary corporation or provided by others in its health care facilities or for reviewing utilization of health services.</DIV>

The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not of itself create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and the public and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1), no indemnification shall be made with respect to any claim, issue, or matter arising from any threatened, pending, or completed action by the corporation or subsidiary corporation as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of a duty to the corporation or subsidiary corporation unless, and only to the extent that, the court in which such action or suit was brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as such court shall deem proper.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A corporation or subsidiary corporation may, pursuant to bylaw, contract, agreement, or resolution of its board of trustees or subsidiary board obligate itself in advance to indemnify persons in accordance with subsections (1) and (2), may establish procedures for approval of indemnification in specific instances in accordance with subsections (1) and (2), and may pay expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit, or proceeding described in subsection (1) in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit, or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking on behalf of a person who may be entitled to indemnification to repay such amount unless it is ultimately determined that the person is entitled to be indemnified by the corporation or subsidiary corporation in accordance with subsections (1) and (2).</DIV>
