<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whenever the council of any city shall determine by resolutions to alter the boundaries of such city, either by taking in lands and premises adjoining thereto, or by taking out any lands and premises included in such city, or both, they shall petition the board of supervisors of the county in which such lands and premises affected thereby are situated to make such change. Such petition shall contain a description by metes and bounds of the lands and premises proposed to be added to or taken out of such city and be accompanied by a map of said lands, and set forth the reasons for the proposed change, and shall contain a copy of the resolution of the council in relation thereto, and shall be certified to by the clerk under the official seal of such city. Before such petition shall be presented to the board of supervisors, notice shall be given by the city clerk of the time and place when the same will be presented for consideration, by publishing the same in 1 or more newspapers published in such city for at least 3 weeks immediately preceding the presentation of the same. Such notice shall also contain a description of the premises proposed to be taken in or out of the boundaries of such city. At the time of presenting such petition all parties interested may appear before such board of supervisors and be heard touching the proposed boundaries of such city, and after such hearing and due consideration of such petition, it shall be the duty of the board of supervisors to order and determine as to whether the prayer contained in the petition or any part thereof shall be granted, and they shall make an order of such determination, which order shall be entered upon their records, and thereupon, if a change of boundaries shall be ordered, then such boundaries of the city shall be fixed and shall exist as provided in such order, and a certified copy thereof shall be transmitted to the clerk of such city and to the secretary of state, and such order shall be prima facie evidence of such change of boundaries of such city and of the regularity of such proceedings in all courts and places: Provided, That the board of supervisors shall not change the boundaries of any city in such a manner as to affect the boundaries of a representative district at a time when changes in the boundaries of representative districts are prohibited: Provided further, That excepting totally uninhabited territory and state owned lands, the board of supervisors shall not so change the boundaries of any such city, until such change shall have been approved by a majority vote of the duly qualified electors of the territory proposed to be added to or taken out of such city, voting at a special election called for that purpose. Such election shall be called and conducted by the clerk of the city, village or township in which such territory lies, within 60 days after receiving notification from the board of supervisors. If such notification be given within 40 days of any general election, the special election shall be held at the same time as such general election. Any such special election shall be advertised and conducted in accordance with the election laws of this state.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 40.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In lieu of the procedure in section 38, as amended, for determining salaries of elected officials, the council by ordinance may establish the procedure described in this section, in which case the restriction contained in section 39 with respect to changing salaries during term shall be inapplicable. The ordinance shall provide:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A local officials compensation commission is created. It shall determine the salaries of city elected officials. The commission shall consist of 5 members who are registered electors of the city, appointed by the mayor subject to confirmation by a majority of the members elected and serving on the council. The terms of office shall be 5 years, except that of the members first appointed, 1 each shall be appointed for terms of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. All first members shall be appointed within 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance. Thereafter members shall be appointed before October 1 of the year of appointment. Vacancies shall be filled for the remainder of an unexpired term. No officer or employee of any government agency or unit or member of the immediate family of such an officer or employee shall be eligible to be appointed to the commission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The commission shall determine the salaries of the city elected officials which determination shall be the salaries unless the legislative body by resolution adopted by 2/3 of the members elected to and serving on the council rejects the determinations. The determinations of the commission shall be effective 30 days following their filing with the city clerk unless rejected by the council. In case of rejection, the existing salary shall prevail. Any expense allowance or reimbursement paid to elected officials in addition to salary shall be for expenses incurred in the course of city business and accounted for to the city.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The commission shall meet for not more than 15 session days in 1973 and every odd numbered year thereafter and shall make its determination within 45 calendar days of its first meeting. A majority of the members of the commission constitutes a quorum for conducting the business of the commission. The commission shall take no action or make determinations without a concurrence of a majority of the members appointed and serving on the commission. The commission shall elect a chairman from among its members. "Session days" means any calendar day on which the commission meets and a quorum is present. The members of the commission shall receive no compensation, but shall be entitled to actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The council may implement the provisions of the ordinance by resolution including the date for convening the commission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Within 60 days after the effective date of the ordinance, a petition for a referendum on the ordinance may be filed with the city clerk containing the signatures of at least 5% of the registered electors of such city on the effective date of the ordinance in which case the election shall be conducted in the same manner as an election on a charter amendment. If a petition for referendum is filed, any determination of the commission shall not be effective until the ordinance has been approved by the electors.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   After 1 year following the effective date of the ordinance, the procedure for establishing the compensation of city elected officials may be changed by charter amendment or revision.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whenever the grade of any street or sidewalk shall have been heretofore, or shall hereafter be established, and improvements shall thereafter be made by the owner or occupant of the adjacent property in conformity to such grade, such grade shall not be changed without compensation to the owner for all damages to such property resulting therefrom, to be ascertained by a jury as provided in chapter 25 of this act, or said damages may be ascertained and agreed upon by and between such city and the owner or occupant of such premises. Whenever such damage shall be ascertained or agreed upon as heretofore provided, such damages, or such part thereof as the council shall deem equitable and just, shall be paid by the city, or the council may cause such damages, or such part thereof as may be just and proper, to be assessed upon such real estate as may be benefited by reason of the change of such grade, and whenever the council shall determine to assess such damages, or any part thereof, upon the property benefited, it shall determine and define a district in said city which in its judgment is benefited by the improvement out of which said damages arise, and shall cause the same to be assessed upon such district, which said assessment shall be upon the owners or occupants of the taxable real estate in said district, in proportion as nearly as may be to the advantage or benefit each lot, parcel, or subdivision is deemed to acquire by the improvement out of which such damages arise, but the property on account of which such damages were awarded shall not be included in said district. The assessment shall be made, and the amount levied and collected in the same manner as other assessments on a district deemed to be benefited in the grading and improvement of streets, as provided for in this act; and all of the provisions of chapter 24 of this act, relative to special assessments and the collection thereof, shall apply thereto. Such damages, when collected as aforesaid, and when determined upon by said city, shall be paid to the person entitled thereto.</DIV>

In case the owner of such lot, land, or premises shall neglect or refuse to make, lay, or put in the connections at the time or in the manner prescribed by the council, then the council shall cause the same to be made, laid, or put in, and the respective owners of such lot, land, or premises shall be liable for the cost thereof, together with 10% in addition thereto as a penalty to be recovered by the city in an action of debt or assumpsit, or the costs together with the amount of the penalty for which the person shall be respectively liable, the council shall cause to be specially assessed in the manner provided in this act.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Said summons shall be served by the city marshal, any member of the police force or any constable of the city, at least 5 days before the return day thereof, upon all the respondents found within the county, by exhibiting the original and delivering a copy to each of them. If any respondent who is a resident of the county cannot be found, the summons shall be served by leaving a copy thereof at his or her usual or the last place of abode, with some person of suitable age and discretion. If any minor or person of unsound mind is interested in the premises to be taken, service may be made on the guardian of such person, if any, and if there is no guardian, the probate court may appoint some discreet and proper person to be guardian ad litem of such person in such proceedings, and such guardian shall have authority to represent such person in said proceedings. The proceedings to appoint such guardian shall be the same as in other cases provided by statute. If it shall appear on the return day of the summons that any respondent cannot be found within the county and has not been served in the manner provided, or is non-resident and has not voluntarily appeared, the court may make an order requiring such respondent or respondents to appear and show cause why the prayer of the petition should not be granted, on a day to be named in the order, and not less than 30 days from the date thereof, and may require that a certified copy of such order be personally served on such respondents wherever found, if practicable, at least 6 days before the time named in order for appearance, or the court may make such order for appearance and require as to any or all such respondents who shall not have been personally served and have not appeared, that service be made by publishing a certified copy of such order for 3 successive weeks, at least once in each week, in at least 1 newspaper published within the municipality, the last publication to be at least 6 days before the day fixed in the order for appearance. Alias and pluries summons may be issued, and the probate court may adjourn the proceedings from time to time as there shall be occasion, and as in other civil cases. Service of such order for appearance in either mode described shall be sufficient notice of the proceedings to bind the respondents and the property represented by them. The return of the officer upon the summons and an affidavit of the due service or the publication of the order for appearance, if any, shall be filed with such probate court before a jury shall be impaneled, and be sufficient evidence of service on the respondents and of the manner of service.</DIV>

If the council believe that a portion of the city in the vicinity of the proposed improvement will be benefited by such improvement, they may by an entry in their minutes determine that the whole or any just proportion of the compensation awarded by the jury shall be assessed upon the owners or occupants of real estate deemed to be thus benefited, and thereupon they shall, by resolution, fix and determine the district or portion of the city benefited, and specify the amount to be assessed upon the owners or occupants of the taxable real estate therein. The amount of the benefit thus ascertained shall be assessed upon the owners or occupants of such taxable real estate, in proportion, as nearly as may be, to the advantage which such lot, parcel or subdivision is deemed to acquire by the improvement. The assessment shall be made and the amount levied and collected in the same manner and by the same officers and proceedings, as near as may be, as is provided in this act for assessing, levying and collecting the expense of a public improvement when a street is graded. The assessment roll containing said assessments, when ratified and confirmed by the council, shall be final and conclusive and prima facie evidence of the regularity and legality of all proceedings prior thereto, and the assessment therein contained shall be a lien on the premises on which the same is made until payment thereof. Whatever amount or portion of such awarded compensation shall not be raised in the manner herein provided shall be assessed, levied and collected upon the taxable real estate of the municipality, the same as other general taxes are assessed and collected therein. At any sale which takes place of the assessed premises or any portion thereof delinquent for non-payment of the amount assessed and levied thereon, the city may become a purchaser.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Within 1 year after the confirmation of the verdict of the jury, or after the judgment of confirmation shall on appeal be confirmed, the council shall set apart and cause to be provided in the treasury, unless already provided, the amount required to make compensation to the owners and persons interested, for the private property taken, as awarded by the jury, and shall, in the resolution setting apart and providing said sum, if not already provided, direct the city to pay the persons respectively entitled to the money so set apart and provided, to each his or her portion, as ascertained and awarded by said verdict. And it shall be the duty of the treasurer to securely hold such money in the treasury for the purpose of paying for the property taken, and pay the same to the persons entitled thereto, according to the verdict of the jury, on demand, and not pay out the money for any other purpose whatever. The council may provide the necessary amount by borrowing from any other money or fund in the treasury and repay the same from money raised to pay the compensation awarded by the jury when collected or otherwise, as they may provide. Whenever the necessary sum is actually in the treasury for such purpose, the treasurer shall make and sign duplicate certificates, verified by his oath, showing that the amount of compensation awarded by the jury is actually in the treasury for payment of the private property taken in the case, giving the title of the case; he shall cause 1 of the certificates to be filed in the office of the probate court before whom such proceedings were had, or his successor, or in case an appeal has been had, then in the office of the clerk of the court in which the proceedings were had, and the other to be filed with the city clerk, which certificate shall be prima facie evidence of the matters therein stated. Whenever the amount of such compensation is in the treasury and thus secured to be paid, the council may enter upon and take possession of and use such private property for the purposes for which it was taken, and may remove all buildings, fences and other obstructions therefrom. In case of resistance or refusal on the part of any one to the council or their agents and servants entering upon and taking possession of such private property for the use and purpose for which it was taken, at any time after the amount of the compensation aforesaid is actually in the treasury, ready to be paid to those entitled thereto, the council, by the city attorney, may apply to the court, and shall be entitled, on making a sufficient showing, to a writ of assistance to put them in possession of the property.</DIV>

If the council and such claimant shall not be able to agree upon the amount of damages to be paid such claimant, then the amount of such damages shall be ascertained by the appraisal of a jury, to be selected in the same manner as in cases of juries to appraise damages for taking private property for public use. Such jury may visit the premises and hear all the proofs in the case, and shall allow such claimant such amount of damages as they may deem proper under all the circumstances, as above stated.

</P>
<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The supervisors of every city shall, in each year, make and complete an assessment of all the real and personal property within their respective wards liable to taxation under the laws of the state, and of all the property of any person liable to be assessed therein, in the same manner, and within the same time as required by law for the assessment of property in the townships of the state, and in so doing they shall conform to the provisions of law governing the action of supervisors of townships performing like services, and in all other respects within their respective wards, they shall, unless otherwise in this act provided, conform to the provisions of law applicable to the action and duties of supervisors in townships, in the assessment of property, the levying of taxes, and in the issuing of warrants for the collection and return thereof: Provided, That any city now incorporated, and which shall become re-incorporated under this act, now having an assessor for the assessment of property and the levying of taxes, such city may retain its present method of assessing property and levying taxes, and such assessor in office at the time this act shall take effect, shall remain in office until the expiration of the term for which he was appointed or elected and until his successor shall have been appointed and qualified. The council of any city re-incorporated under the provisions of this act may by ordinance provide for the appointment by the council upon the recommendation of the mayor, a city assessor who shall hold his office for 1 year from and after the first Monday in March of the year in which he shall have been appointed, and such appointment shall be made as aforesaid on or before the second Monday in April in each year. Such assessor shall make an assessment of all real and personal property within such city in the same manner, and have the same powers, and perform the same duties touching the assessment of such property and the levying of such taxes as are performed by supervisors in townships in such matters, which powers shall be exercised and duties shall be performed by such assessor instead of being executed and performed by the supervisor of the several wards in any such city as hereinbefore provided. Such assessor shall make his assessment of all such property in a single roll. Where, however, the council has decided to have the taxes levied and collected in 2 installments, such assessments shall be made in 2 separate rolls, 1 for the city taxes and special assessments to be known as the "city or July tax roll," the other for the state, county and school taxes, to be known as the "December tax roll," and in the making of such assessments and in the levying of taxes such city shall be treated as a whole or as 1 assessment district as townships are treated under the general tax laws of the state.</DIV>

However, if 50 or more of the qualified voters of any city described in this section as a city of the fourth class, which city has been incorporated under a special act of the legislature, shall file with the city council, on or before the first day of November, in the year of our Lord 1895, a petition praying that an election of the qualified voters of such city be called to determine the question as to whether such city shall remain incorporated under the special act under which it was incorporated and by which it is governed at the time of the filing of the petition, or whether it shall become subject to the provisions of this act, thereupon it shall be the duty of the city council, within 10 days after the filing of the petition, to call a special election of the qualified voters of the city to determine the question. If a majority of all the votes cast at the election are in favor of remaining incorporated under the special act by which the city is governed at the time of the filing of the petition, then the city shall not be reincorporated under the provisions of this act, but shall remain incorporated under the special act, which shall remain in full force and effect as if this law had not been enacted. However, if a city of this state, when the population of the city is 10,000 or less, according to the last preceding state census even though the voters of the city previously elected to remain incorporated under the special act governing the city, may be incorporated under and made subject to the provisions of this act and the act of which this act is amendatory, as a city of the fourth class as provided in this section. If 100 or more registered electors residing within the city files with the city council, on or before the first day of July in any year, a petition praying that an election of the qualified voters of the city be called to determine the question as to whether the city shall become incorporated as a city of the fourth class under this act, then the city council shall within 10 days after the filing of the petition call a special election of the qualified voters of the city to determine the question. Except as otherwise provided in this section, an election held under this chapter shall be held upon such day, and at such time and in such places in the city as may be designated by a resolution of the city council. However, an election shall be held on or before the first day of December in the year in which the petition under this section is filed. Notice of the election shall be given in the same manner and for the same length of time as is provided in the charter of the city for the calling of special elections, and the votes shall be counted and canvassed, and the returns shall be made, and the result declared and determined in the same manner as is provided in the charter for the counting, canvassing, and returning of votes, and the determining of the result of the election at special elections. No new registration shall be necessary for the holding of the election, and only those whose names appear in the registration books used at the next previous annual city election shall be entitled to vote at the election. The ballots used at the election shall contain the instructions required by the general election laws of the state, and the proposition to be submitted shall be in the following language:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   For becoming reincorporated under the general law -- Yes. []</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   For becoming reincorporated under the general law -- No. []</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If a majority of the votes cast at the election shall be in favor of reincorporating under the provisions of this act, then the city shall become reincorporated under and made subject to the provisions of this act on the first day of January in the year following the special election. At the next regular meeting, the council shall, by a resolution to be entered in the record of their proceedings, recite that at the election, stating the date of the election, the question as to whether the city should be reincorporated as a city of the fourth class under the provisions of this act was submitted to a vote of the electors of the city, and that a majority of those voting upon the question, voted for reincorporation, and shall in the resolution declare that, in accordance with said vote, the city shall be and is reincorporated as a city of the fourth class; the clerk of the city shall record the same in the record of the proceedings of the council and shall make a copy of so much of the record of the proceedings of the meeting at which the resolution was adopted as may be necessary to show the time and place of holding the meeting, and the names of the members of the council who were present, and the passage of the resolution, including a true copy of the record. The clerk and the mayor of the city shall annex their certificate to the true copy of the record, under the corporate seal of the city showing the same to be a true copy of the record, which said certified copy of the record and resolution shall be designated as a "declaration of reincorporation" and shall be transmitted to, and filed and recorded in the office of the secretary of state, and the declaration of reincorporation filed in the office of the secretary of state, or the records of the secretary of state, or certified copies of such records shall be prima facie evidence of the due and legal reincorporation of the city as a city of the fourth class under the provisions of this act.</DIV>
