<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A track license, once issued, is valid only as long as the annual license fee is paid, or until the track license is voluntarily surrendered or is revoked as provided in this act or the rules promulgated under this act.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An applicant for a license to conduct a thoroughbred race meeting shall apply to conduct not fewer than 30 days of live thoroughbred racing during its proposed race meeting. Except during the opening and closing week of a race meeting, the applicant shall apply to conduct live racing not fewer than 2 days per week, with not fewer than 8 live horse races programmed, and shall conduct live racing programs on the days allocated by the racing commissioner. The commissioner shall allocate not fewer than 10 days of live horse racing to a race meeting licensee with not fewer than 6 programmed live races per allocated day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An applicant for a license to conduct a standardbred race meeting shall apply to conduct not fewer than 30 days of live standardbred harness horse racing during its proposed race meeting. Except during the opening and closing week of a race meeting, the applicant shall apply to conduct live horse racing not fewer than 2 days per week, with not fewer than 8 live horse races programmed, and shall conduct live racing programs on the days awarded. The commissioner shall allocate not fewer than 10 days of live horse racing to a race meeting licensee with not fewer than 6 programmed live races per allocated day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a race meeting licensee is unable to program and conduct 8 live horse races on a racing date awarded to the licensee because there are fewer than 5 entries in a race, the licensee shall not conduct any simulcasting on that day without the written consent of the certified horsemen's organization with which it has a contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a race meeting licensee is unable to conduct racing on a live racing date awarded to the licensee or fewer than 8 live horse races on an awarded live racing date because of a labor dispute, fire, adverse weather conditions, or other causes beyond the race meeting licensee's control, the race meeting licensee is considered to have conducted those races or that race date for purposes of this act and is not precluded from conducting any simulcasts because of the licensee's inability to conduct those live races or that race date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Intertrack simulcast races that a race meeting licensee contracts to receive from other racetracks that are canceled for any of the reasons described in subsection (4) are offered to the public for purposes of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If an entire race meeting or the balance of a race meeting and racing dates awarded to a licensee cannot be raced because of an act of God or significant physical damage to the licensed racetrack at which the race meeting was licensed to be conducted caused by fire or some other catastrophe, the racing commissioner may transfer those dates to another race meeting licensee upon application of the substitute licensee if the substitute licensee satisfies the requirements for licensure under this act and demonstrates that it has or will have a legal or contractual right to the use of a different licensed racetrack facility on the racing dates in question, and all race meeting licensees that will be conducting live racing on those dates within 50 miles of the substitute racetrack consent to the transfer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Notwithstanding anything in this act to the contrary, if the racing commissioner determines that 1 or more of the conditions listed in subsection (8) apply and the contracted certified horsemen's organization is in agreement, the racing commissioner may amend an existing race meeting license and simulcast permit to allow the licensee to continue simulcasting during the remaining period of the race meeting license. An amended license under this section may be issued by the racing commissioner at any time, including at the time of the initial issuance of the race meeting license for the upcoming year during which it is valid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The racing commissioner may issue an order amending a race meeting license under subsection (7) if he or she determines that the licensee is capable of conducting simulcast horse racing in accordance with this act and that 1 or more of the following conditions exist:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) There is inadequate horse supply for the licensee to conduct a live race meeting of at least 10 days with 6 races per day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) There is inadequate funding of live racing purses to support the licensee's conducting of a live race meeting of at least 10 days with 6 races per day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) There is no certified horsemen's organization operating in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) In order to obtain an amended license issued under subsection (7) and satisfy the live racing requirements of this act, the licensee must have a written contract with a certified horsemen's organization to pay a percentage of its net commission from simulcasting to the live racing purse pool at another racetrack licensed under this act during the period when the amended license issued under subsection (7) is in effect. Unless otherwise provided in the written contract between the licensee and the certified horsemen's organization, the payment must be not less than 25% of net commission from simulcasting if only 1 certified horsemen's organization has a contract for live race days in this state for the calendar year. If both certified horsemen's organizations have a contract for live race dates in this state for the calendar year, the payment must be not more than 40% of the net commission from simulcasting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Subsections (7) to (9) apply only to amendments to a race meeting license for the purpose of allowing simulcast-only operations and are not limitations on or requirements for other race meeting license amendments the racing commissioner may approve or deny.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Notwithstanding anything in this act to the contrary, if a race meeting licensee and the certified horsemen's organization with which the licensee has a contract jointly request that the licensee be allowed to conduct a live race meeting with fewer than 8 races per day, the racing commissioner shall approve the request and issue an order amending the license accordingly.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Before November 1 of the year preceding the year for which applications are made, the racing commissioner shall grant or deny each application for a race meeting license, allocate or deny the dates, for which application has been made, on which pari-mutuel wagering on live races may be conducted at each licensed race meeting in this state, and shall also determine whether the applicant may simulcast under section 18 during the calendar year for which the license is issued. The racing commissioner may grant a race meeting license for any time period up to 1 year during which the licensee may conduct live and simulcast horse races with pari-mutuel wagering on the results of the races.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to section 12(4), all simulcasting authorized by the racing commissioner must be conditioned on the holder of the license conducting not fewer than 8 live horse races on each live racing date allocated in the holder's race meeting license, unless this requirement is waived in writing by both the racing commissioner and the certified horsemen's organization with which the licensee has contracted.</div>

Before making the required determination to impose a fine or suspend or revoke a race meeting license under this subsection, the racing commissioner shall consider whether the race meeting licensee's inability or failure to meet the requirements of its license is due to a cause beyond the control of the race meeting licensee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Any action taken by the racing commissioner under subsection (4) becomes effective 10 days after the holder of the race meeting license receives written notice unless the commissioner finds that the public health, safety, or welfare requires emergency action and immediate effect of the commissioner's order.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Each person participating in or having to do with pari-mutuel horse racing or pari-mutuel wagering on the results of horse races at a licensed race meeting, including, but not limited to, all racing officials, veterinarians, pari-mutuel clerks or tellers, totalisator company employees, security guards, timers, horse owners, jockeys, drivers, apprentices, exercise riders, authorized agents, trainers, grooms, valets, owners of stables operating under an assumed name, jockey agents, pony riders, hot walkers, blacksmiths, starting gate employees, owners and operators of off-track training centers, farms or stables where racehorses are kept, and vendors operating within the barn area of a licensed racetrack or off-track training center, farm, or stable where racehorses are kept may be licensed by the racing commissioner pursuant to rules promulgated by the racing commissioner under this act. The racing commissioner shall not issue an occupational license to a person who, within the 6 years immediately preceding the date of the person's application for the occupational license, was convicted of a felony involving theft, dishonesty, misrepresentation, fraud, corruption, drug possession, delivery, or use, or other criminal misconduct that is related to the person's ability to and the likelihood that the person will perform the functions and duties of the racing related occupation for which the person seeks to be licensed and participate in pari-mutuel horse racing in that licensed occupation in a fair, honest, open, and lawful manner. The racing commissioner shall not issue a pari-mutuel occupational license to a person who, within 2 years immediately preceding the date of the person's application for the occupational license, was convicted of a misdemeanor involving theft, dishonesty, misrepresentation, fraud, corruption, drug possession, delivery, or use, or other criminal misconduct that is related to the person's ability to and the likelihood that the person will perform the functions and duties of the racing related occupation for which the person seeks to be licensed and participate in pari-mutuel horse racing in that licensed occupation in a fair, honest, open, and lawful manner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A veterinarian is not required to be licensed under this act to provide necessary and appropriate emergency veterinary care or treatment to any horse that is intended to be entered, is entered, or participates in a race with wagering by pari-mutuel methods or a nonbetting race or workout conducted at a licensed race meeting in this state. For purposes of this section, "emergency veterinary care or treatment" means care or treatment necessary and appropriate to save the life of a horse or prevent permanent physical injury or damage to a horse in a situation requiring immediate veterinary action. Only veterinarians licensed under this act may provide nonemergency veterinary care or treatment to a horse in this state that is intended to be entered, is entered, or participates in races at licensed race meetings in this state. Only persons licensed under this act or otherwise authorized by the racing commissioner may enter the restricted grounds of a licensed race meeting where horses are kept that are eligible to race at the race meeting. For the purposes of this section and sections 30 and 31, a horse that is intended to be entered is a horse that has its name put into the draw for a specific race, and a horse that is entered in a race is a horse that has been drawn into a specific race.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) As conditions precedent to being issued and holding a valid pari-mutuel occupational license, a license applicant shall disclose, in writing, any ownership interest that the applicant has in a racehorse and provide any other information the racing commissioner considers necessary and proper and proof of compliance with the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.101 to 418.941, except that the proof of compliance requirement does not apply to horse owners and trainers not covered under section 115 of the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.115.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In addition to the requirements of subsection (3), an applicant for a pari-mutuel occupational license shall consent, upon application and for the duration of the occupational license, if issued, to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Personal inspections, inspections of the applicant's personal property, and inspections of premises and property related to his or her participation in a race meeting by persons authorized by the racing commissioner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the applicant is applying for a racing official, jockey, driver, trainer, or groom license, or for any other license for an occupation that involves contact with or access to the racehorses or the barn areas or stables where racehorses are kept, a breathalyzer test, urine test, or other noninvasive fluid test to detect the presence of alcohol or a controlled substance, if directed to do so by the racing commissioner or his or her representative. If the results of a test show that an occupational licensee has more than .05% of alcohol in his or her blood, or has present in his or her body a controlled substance, the person shall not be permitted to continue in his or her duties or participate in horse racing until he or she can produce, at his or her own expense, a negative test result. The licensee may be penalized by the racing commissioner for his or her positive test results, which may include any disciplinary action authorized by this act or rules promulgated under this act. This subsection does not apply to a controlled substance obtained directly from, or pursuant to a valid prescription from, a licensed health care provider, except that the racing commissioner may consider the person's medical need for prescribed controlled substances in determining the person's fitness to be licensed to participate in pari-mutuel horse racing. The racing commissioner shall suspend for not less than 1 year the license of a person who for the third time in a period of not more than 6 consecutive years is relieved of his or her duties because of this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) When applying for an occupational license, an applicant shall provide the racing commissioner with 1 or more sets of his or her fingerprints and the appropriate fees as requested by the racing commissioner. The racing commissioner shall send the applicant's fingerprints and the appropriate fees to either the department of state police or the federal bureau of investigation in a manner acceptable to the federal bureau of investigation. If the fingerprints and fees are sent to the department of state police, the department of state police shall forward the fingerprints and the fees to the federal bureau of investigation for a criminal history check. Information obtained under this subsection shall only be used to determine the character and fitness of the applicant for licensing purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A person who is issued a pari-mutuel occupational license as a trainer is responsible for and absolute insurer of the condition, fitness, eligibility, and qualification of the horses entered to race for the person by whom the trainer is employed, except as prescribed by the rules promulgated by the racing commissioner under this act. This subsection shall not be construed or interpreted to determine civil tort liability of any racehorse owner or trainer but shall be for purposes of enforcement of this act only. A trainer shall not start a horse that has in its body a drug or foreign substance unless permitted pursuant to section 30 and the rules promulgated under that section. A trainer is strictly liable and subject to disciplinary action if a horse under the trainer's actual or apparent care and control as trainer has a drug or foreign substance in its body, in violation of section 30 and the rules promulgated under that section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Upon the filing of a written complaint, under oath, in the office of the racing commissioner, or upon the written motion of the racing commissioner regarding the actions or omissions of a person issued a pari-mutuel occupational license, the racing commissioner may summarily suspend the occupational license of the person for a period of not more than 90 days pending a hearing and final determination by the racing commissioner regarding the acts or omissions complained of in the written complaint or motion, if the commissioner determines from the complaint or motion that the public health, safety, or welfare requires emergency action. The racing commissioner shall schedule the complaint or motion to be heard within 14 business days after the occupational license is summarily suspended and notify the holder of the occupational license of the date, time, and place of the hearing not less than 5 days before the date of the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the contested case provisions of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328. The action of the racing commissioner in revoking or suspending a pari-mutuel occupational license may be appealed to the circuit court pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328. If the racing commissioner's order is predicated upon a series of acts, the review by the circuit court may be in the county in which any of the alleged acts or failures to act took place.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A decision by the racing commissioner or a deputy commissioner or state steward of racing to deny an application for an occupational license may be appealed to the circuit court and reviewed pursuant to section 631 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.631. A suspension or revocation of an occupational license may be appealed and reviewed pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Each pari-mutuel occupational licensee shall pay a license fee of not less than $10.00 or more than $100.00 as determined by the racing commissioner.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The pari-mutuel system of wagering on the results of horse races as permitted by this act is not unlawful. All forms of pari-mutuel wagering must be conducted under a race meeting license preapproved by the racing commissioner by rule or written order of the commissioner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If pari-mutuel wagering is used at a race meeting, a totalisator or other device that is equal in accuracy and clearness to a totalisator and approved by the racing commissioner must be used. The odds display of the totalisator or other device must be placed in full view of the patrons. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Subject to section 18(3), each holder of a race meeting license shall retain as his or her commission on all forms of straight wagering 17% of all money wagered involving straight wagering on the results of live and simulcast horse races conducted at the licensee's race meetings. Subject to section 18(3), each holder of a race meeting license shall retain as his or her commission on all forms of multiple wagering without the written permission of the racing commissioner not more than 28% and with the written permission of the racing commissioner not more than 35% of all money wagered involving any form of multiple wagering on the results of live and simulcast horse races conducted at the licensee's race meeting. Except as otherwise provided by contract, 50% of all commissions from wagering on the results of live racing at the racetrack where the live racing was conducted must be paid to the horsemen's purse pool at the racetrack where the live racing was conducted. As used in this subsection:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Multiple wagering" means a wager made on the finishing positions of more than 1 horse in a specified race or the finishing positions of 1 or more horses in more than 1 specified race.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Payoff prices of tickets of a higher denomination must be calculated as even multiples of the payoff price for a $1.00 wager. Each holder of a race meeting license shall distribute to the persons holding winning tickets, as a minimum, a sum not less than $1.10 calculated on the basis of each $1.00 deposited in a pool, except that each race meeting licensee may distribute a sum of not less than $1.05 to persons holding winning tickets for each $1.00 deposited in a minus pool. As used in this subsection, "minus pool" means any win, place, or show pool in which the payout would exceed the total value of the pool.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A holder of a race meeting license shall not knowingly permit a person less than 18 years of age to be a patron of the pari-mutuel wagering conducted or supervised by the holder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Any act or transaction relative to pari-mutuel wagering on the results of live or simulcast horse races may be conducted by a race meeting licensee under this act for the race meeting licensee to comply with the auditing requirements of section 23. A person shall not provide messenger service for the placing of a bet for another person who is not a patron. However, this subsection does not prevent simulcasting or intertrack or interstate common pool wagering inside or outside this state as permitted by this act or the rules promulgated under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Any form of pari-mutuel wagering on the results of live or simulcast horse races must only be conducted or operated by a race meeting licensee, which may use its contracted licensed third-party facilitators, as determined and approved by the racing commissioner. The race meeting licensee is responsible for all conduct of its third-party facilitators. All wagers must be placed by persons within this state and may be placed only in person at a licensed race meeting or electronically through a licensed third-party facilitator. A race meeting licensee or licensed third-party facilitator shall not solicit, offer, accept, or process wagers on or in connection with other gaming or gambling products, including, but not limited to, slot machines and casino table games.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A person that does not hold a race meeting license or a third-party facilitator license that solicits or accepts wagers on the results of live or simulcast horse races from individuals in this state is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years or a fine of not more than $10,000.00, or both. Each act of solicitation or wager that is accepted in violation of this section is a separate offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Only a race meeting licensee or its contracted licensed third-party facilitator may process, accept, offer, or solicit wagers on the results of live or simulcast horse races as determined and approved by the racing commissioner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) As used in this section, "act or transaction relative to pari-mutuel wagering on the results of live or simulcast horse races" means those steps taken by a race meeting licensee to accept a wager and process it within the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with this act.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Simulcasting by race meeting licensees may be authorized by the racing commissioner subject to the limitations of this section. Except as specifically provided in section 12, a race meeting licensee shall not conduct simulcast wagering unless the race meeting licensee conducts 30 or more live racing days in that calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The holder of a race meeting license may apply to the racing commissioner, in the manner and form required by the commissioner, for a permit to televise simulcasts of horse races to viewing areas within the enclosure of the licensed racetrack at which the applicant is licensed to conduct its race meeting. The commissioner may issue a permit for individual race and full card simulcasts televised during, between, before, or after programmed live horse races on any day that live racing is conducted by the applicant, and also on other days during the term of the applicant's license when the applicant does not conduct live horse racing, subject to the following conditions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The applicant must have a current contract with a certified horsemen's organization.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The applicant must have applied for the minimum number of live racing dates required by section 12(1) or (2), subject to the availability of adequate horse supply as determined by the racing commissioner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The applicant must make a continuing good faith effort throughout the duration of its race meeting to program and conduct not fewer than 8 live horse races on each live racing date allocated to the applicant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The certified horsemen's organization with which the applicant has contracted must have consented to the requested simulcasts on any live racing day when the applicant is unable to program and conduct not fewer than 8 live horse races, if required by section 12(3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the requested simulcasts are interstate, the applicant must waive in writing any right that the applicant may have under the interstate horse racing act of 1978, 15 USC 3001 to 3007, to restrict interstate simulcasts by other race meeting licensees in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The applicant must make the video and audio signals of its live horse races available for intertrack simulcasting to all licensed race meetings in this state located more than 12 miles from the applicant's race meeting. The applicant must charge each race meeting licensee the same fee to receive its live signals for intertrack simulcasting. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Except as otherwise agreed by the other race meeting licensees and the respective certified horsemen's organizations with which they contract, the applicant must receive all available intertrack simulcasts from licensed race meetings located more than 12 miles from the applicant's race meeting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The applicant must not conduct interstate simulcasts unless it also receives all intertrack simulcasts from other licensed race meetings that are available. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) All authorized simulcasts must be conducted in compliance with the written permit and related orders issued by the racing commissioner and all other requirements and conditions of this act and the rules of the racing commissioner promulgated under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) All authorized interstate simulcasts must also comply with the interstate horse racing act of 1978, 15 USC 3001 to 3007.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) All forms of wagering by pari-mutuel methods provided for under this act for live racing shall be allowed on simulcast horse races authorized under this section. All money wagered on simulcast horse races at a licensed race meeting must be included in computing the total amount of all money wagered at the licensed race meeting for purposes of section 17. If the simulcast is an interstate simulcast, the money wagered on the simulcast must form a separate pari-mutuel pool at the receiving track unless 2 or more licensees receive the same interstate simulcast signals or the racing commissioner permits the receiving track to combine its interstate simulcast pool with the pool created at the out-of-state sending track on the same race. If 2 or more licensees receive the same interstate simulcast signals, the money wagered on the simulcasts must be combined in a common pool and the licensees shall jointly agree and designate at which race meeting the common pool will be located. However, if the law of the jurisdiction in which the sending racetrack is located permits interstate common pools at the sending racetrack, the racing commissioner may permit pari-mutuel pools on interstate simulcast races in this state to be combined with pari-mutuel pools on the same races created at the out-of-state sending racetrack. If the pari-mutuel pools on the interstate simulcast races in this state are combined in a common pool at the out-of-state sending track, then the commissions described in section 17 on the pool created in this state must be adjusted to equal the commissions in effect at the sending track under the laws of its jurisdiction. If the simulcast is an intertrack simulcast, the money wagered on the simulcast at the receiving racetrack must be added to the pari-mutuel pool at the sending racetrack.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A race meeting licensee licensed to conduct pari-mutuel horse racing shall provide the necessary equipment to send intertrack simulcasts of the live horse races conducted at its race meeting to all other race meeting licensees in this state, and shall send its intertrack simulcast signals to those licensees upon request for an agreed fee, which shall not exceed 3% of the total amount wagered on the race at the receiving track.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The racing commissioner may authorize a race meeting licensee to transmit simulcasts of live horse races conducted at its racetrack to locations outside of this state in accordance with the interstate horse racing act of 1978, 15 USC 3001 to 3007, or any other applicable laws, and may permit pari-mutuel pools on such simulcast races created under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the receiving track is located to be combined in a common pool with pari-mutuel pools on the same races created in this state. A race meeting licensee that transmits simulcasts of its races to locations outside this state shall pay 50% of the fee that it receives for sending the simulcast signal to the horsemen's purse pool at the sending track after first deducting the actual verified cost of sending the signal out of state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Unless otherwise approved by the racing commissioner, a race meeting licensee shall not receive and offer wagers on an interstate simulcast unless the interstate simulcast is available to all race meeting licensees in this state at the same rate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Simulcasting of events other than horse races for purposes of pari-mutuel wagering is prohibited.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Interstate simulcast" means a live simulcast from a racetrack outside of this state to a racetrack inside this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Intertrack simulcast" means a live simulcast from 1 racetrack in this state to another racetrack in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Simulcast" means the live transmission of video and audio signals conveying a horse race held either inside or outside of this state to a licensed race meeting in this state.</div>
