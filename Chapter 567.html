If reimbursement is sought for a payment made on a negotiable instrument, including a travelers check or money order, the holder shall be reimbursed under this subsection upon filing proof that the instrument was duly presented and that payment was made to a person who appeared to the holder to be entitled to payment.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   For the purposes of this section, "good faith" means all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That payment or delivery was made in a reasonable attempt to comply with this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   That the person delivering the property was not a fiduciary then in breach of trust in respect to the property and had a reasonable basis for believing, based on the facts then known to him or her, that the property was abandoned for the purposes of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   That there is no showing that the records under which the delivery was made did not meet reasonable commercial standards of practice in the industry.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Property removed from a safe deposit box or other safekeeping repository is received by the administrator subject to the holder's right under this subsection to be reimbursed for the actual cost of the opening and to any valid lien or contract providing for the holder to be reimbursed for unpaid rent or storage charges. The administrator shall reimburse or pay the holder out of the proceeds remaining after deducting the administrator's selling cost.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), the administrator, not later than 3 years after the receipt of abandoned property, shall sell it to the highest bidder at public sale in whatever city in the state affords, in the judgment of the administrator, the most favorable market for the property involved. The administrator may decline the highest bid and reoffer the property for sale if, in the judgment of the administrator, the bid is insufficient. If, in the judgment of the administrator, the probable cost of sale exceeds the value of the property, the property need not be offered for sale. Any sale held under this section shall be preceded by a single publication of notice, at least 3 weeks in advance of sale, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the property is to be sold.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Securities listed on an established stock exchange shall be sold at prices prevailing at the time of sale on the exchange. Securities not listed on an established stock exchange may be sold over the counter at prices prevailing at the time of sale or by any other method the administrator considers advisable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Unless the administrator considers it to be in the best interest of the state to do otherwise, all securities presumed abandoned under this act and delivered to the administrator shall be sold within 1 year of the receipt of the securities. A person making a claim under this act against the state, the holder, any transfer agent, registrar, or other person acting for or on behalf of a holder is not entitled to any appreciation in the value of the property occurring after delivery by the holder to the administrator.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The purchaser of property at any sale conducted by the administrator under this act takes the property free of all claims of the owner or previous holder of the property and of all persons claiming through or under the owner or previous holder.

<P>Sec. 25.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A person, excluding another state, claiming an interest in any property paid or delivered to the administrator under this act, may file with the administrator a claim on a form prescribed by the administrator and verified by the claimant.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The administrator shall consider each claim within 90 days after it is filed and give written notice to the claimant if the claim is denied in whole or in part. The notice may be given by mailing it to the last address, if any, stated in the claim as the address to which notices are to be sent. If no address for notices is stated in the claim, the notice may be mailed to the last address, if any, of the claimant as stated in the claim. No notice of denial need be given if the claim fails to state either the last address to which notices are to be sent or the address of the claimant. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a claim is allowed, the administrator shall pay over or deliver to the claimant the property or the amount the administrator actually received or the net proceeds if it has been sold by the administrator, plus any additional amount required by section 22. If the property claimed was interest bearing to the owner on the date of surrender by the holder, and if the date of surrender is on or after March 28, 1996, the administrator also shall pay interest at a rate of 6% a year or any lesser rate the property earned while in the possession of the holder. Interest begins to accrue when the interest bearing property is delivered to the administrator and ceases on the earlier of the expiration of 10 years after delivery or the date on which payment is made to the owner. No interest on interest bearing property is payable for any period before March 28, 1996.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Any holder who pays the owner for property that has been delivered to the state and which, if claimed from the administrator, would be subject to subsection (3) shall add interest as provided in that subsection. The added interest must be repaid to the holder by the administrator in the same manner as the principal.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The property was subjected to custody by this state because the records of the holder did not reflect the last known address of the apparent owner when the property was presumed abandoned under this act, and the other state establishes that the last known address of the apparent owner or other person entitled to the property was in that state and under the laws of that state the property escheated to or was subject to a claim of abandonment by that state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The last known address of the apparent owner or other person entitled to the property, as reflected by the records of the holder, is in the other state and under the laws of that state the property has escheated to or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The records of the holder were erroneous in that they did not accurately reflect the actual owner of the property and the last known address of the actual owner is in the other state and under the laws of that state the property escheated to or was subject to a claim of abandonment by that state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The property was subjected to custody by this state under section 4(f) and under the laws of the state of domicile of the holder the property has escheated to or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The property is the sum payable on a travelers check, money order, or other similar instrument that was subjected to custody by this state under section 5, and the instrument was purchased in the other state, and under the laws of that state the property escheated to or became subject to a claim of abandonment by that state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The claim of another state, under the laws of that state, to recover escheated or abandoned property shall be presented in a form prescribed by the administrator, who shall decide the claim within 90 days after it is presented. The administrator shall allow the claim if the administrator determines that the other state is entitled to the property under subsection (1).</DIV>

This amendatory act is retroactive and applies to audits in progress as of August 15, 2015, but does not retroactively apply to contested determinations in litigation before the date of enactment of this amendatory act."</p>
</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>567.251 Verified report of unclaimed property being held; examination of records to determine compliance with act; notice; audit; incomplete records; cost of examination; failure to maintain records; insufficient records for preparation of report; issuance of check in streamlined process; "substantially complete records" defined.</B><P>Sec. 31.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The administrator may require a person who has not filed a report under this act or a person who the administrator believes has filed an inactive, incomplete, or false report, to file a verified report in a form specified by the administrator. The report shall state whether the person is holding any unclaimed property reportable or deliverable under this act, describe unclaimed property not previously reported or as to which the administrator has made inquiry, and specifically identify and state the amounts of property that may be in issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The administrator, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, may examine the records of a person to determine whether the person has complied with this act. The administrator may conduct the examination even if the person believes he or she is not in possession of any property reportable or deliverable under this act. The administrator may contract with any other person to conduct the examination on behalf of the administrator. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a person is treated under section 13 as the holder of the property only insofar as the interest of the business association in the property is concerned, the administrator, pursuant to subsection (2), may examine the records of the person if the administrator has given the notice required by subsection (2) to both the person and the business association at least 90 days before the examination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Any examination performed by the administrator or his or her duly authorized agents must be performed in accordance with the generally accepted auditing standards to the extent applicable to unclaimed property examinations. A person who has been audited by the administrator or his or her duly authorized agents or a person whose books, records, and papers have been examined by the administrator or his or her duly authorized agents shall be provided a complete copy in printed or electronic format of the audit report, which shall identify in detail the work performed, the property types reviewed, any estimation techniques employed, calculations showing the potential amount of property due, and a statement of findings as well as all other correspondence and documentation which formed a basis for the findings. Not later than 6 months after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection, the administrator shall electronically file a request for rule-making with the office of regulatory reinvention pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, to initiate rules on auditing standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) When the person being examined does not have substantially complete records, the administrator or his or her duly authorized agents may determine the amount of any abandoned or unclaimed property due and owing based upon a reasonable method of estimation consistent with the standards described in subsection (4). If the person being examined has filed all the required reports and has maintained substantially complete records, then all of the following apply to the examination:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The examination shall include a review of the person's books and records.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The examination shall not be based on an estimate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The administrator or his or her duly authorized agents shall consider all evidence presented by the holder to remediate the findings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If an examination of the records of a person results in the disclosure of property reportable and deliverable under this act, the administrator may assess the cost of the examination against the holder at the rate of $50.00 a day for each examiner; however, the charges shall not exceed the value of the property actually found to be reportable and deliverable. The cost of examination made pursuant to subsection (3) shall be imposed only against the business association.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a holder fails after the effective date of this act to maintain the records required by section 32 and the records of the holder available for the periods subject to this act are insufficient to permit the preparation of a report, the administrator may require the holder to report and pay an amount as may reasonably be estimated from any available records.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) For an eligible holder that has elected to follow the streamlined process described in section 31b, examinations shall not include checks voided within 180 days from the date of issuance of the check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) As used in this section, "substantially complete records" means at least 90% of the records necessary for unclaimed property examination purposes as defined under the principles of internal controls. The determination of substantially complete records shall not be made solely as a percentage of the total overall individual records to be examined, but also on a materiality level of value of the records. The lack of greater than 10% of records in 1 particular property class to be examined does not result in the extrapolation of error in those areas in which a person has filed all the required reports and has maintained at least 90% of the overall records for that particular property class. Substantially complete records are not meant to be an absolute measurement of all available records.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the administrator determines that a holder has failed to report or deliver to the administrator unclaimed property as required by this act, the administrator shall mail to the holder by certified or registered mail a notice of examination determination, which shall include the property deliverable. The notice of examination determination shall constitute a decision of the administrator.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The holder shall deliver to the administrator the property that is not contested. While the request for reconsideration is pending, interest continues to accrue on all undelivered property.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Within 60 days of filing the request for reconsideration, the holder may submit additional documentation and written submissions to the administrator in support of the reconsideration. The administrator may meet with the holder or have informal communication with the holder as part of the reconsideration process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Within 60 days of receipt of the holder's request for reconsideration or within 60 days after the receipt of additional documentation, the administrator shall mail the holder a written decision regarding the contested property. The decision shall state the reasons and authority that support the administrator's decision. The time period for a decision in this subsection may be extended by the administrator for good cause, but shall not exceed 183 days from the day the administrator received the holder's request for reconsideration. The decision shall be mailed to the holder by certified or registered mail at the address provided in the request for reconsideration. If the holder prevails as to any portion of the contested property, the administrator shall return to the holder any property that had been delivered.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Within 90 days after mailing the decision regarding reconsideration in subsection (7), the holder may contest the decision by filing an action in circuit court, unless, within that time, the holder files an appeal with the administrator. The administrator shall select a delegate to conduct the appeal. The delegate may not be employed by, or contracted with, the department to provide auditing or administrative services for the enforcement of this act other than as a delegate for an appeal. If the holder elects to contest the decision in this subsection by filing an appeal with the administrator, in lieu of filing an action in circuit court, the holder may later file an action in circuit court under the provisions of subsection (9) or (13). The delegate shall have the knowledge, skill, and ability to qualify as an administrative law examiner under the Michigan civil service commission's job specifications.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) At any time, the holder may file with the administrator a written notice of withdrawal of the appeal to the administrator. Within 90 days after the notice of withdrawal is mailed to the administrator, the holder may file an action in circuit court based on the decision as reconsidered by the administrator in subsection (7).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The notice of appeal under subsection (8) shall state the holder's name, mailing address, and telephone number; the name of the person or persons representing the holder; the representative's mailing address and telephone number; and the reason that holder believes the reconsidered decision of the administrator was in error.

The appeal is not subject to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328. The holder may appear or be represented by any person before the delegate and may present testimony and argument. At the party's own expense and with advance notice to the other party, a holder or the delegate, or both, may make an audiorecording of the appeal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The hearing on the appeal to the administrator shall be conducted by the administrator's delegate within 90 days after the filing of the appeal unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The administrator may request that the attorney general of another state or any other person bring an action in the name of the administrator in the other state. This state shall pay all expenses including attorney's fees in any action under this subsection.
