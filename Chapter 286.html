In designating white pine blister rust control areas, the commissioner shall use due care to fix their boundaries so as to protect white pines on such areas from damage by white pine blister rust. It shall be the duty of every land owner within such designated areas to carry out such control measures as are ordered by the commissioner, including the removal and destruction of any or all wild and cultivated currants and gooseberries or white pines. No currants or gooseberries shall be planted within such white pine blister rust control areas without written permission from the commissioner. No white pines shall be planted within such fruiting currant or gooseberry control areas without written permission of the commissioner. If the owner fails to destroy the above named plants within the time specified by the commissioner, the commissioner shall cause said plants to be destroyed and the expense thereof shall be a lien upon the owner's land. Such lien shall have the same effect and may be collected in the same manner as taxes upon such land. Any moneys so collected shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the fund provided for this work.</DIV>

Inspections of nurseries that distribute nursery stock interstate shall be conducted annually, provided those nurseries are in compliance with this act. If the director conducts an inspection under this subsection, the director shall assess an inspection fee as provided for in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If upon the inspection of any nursery stock the department determines that the nursery stock or nursery and its premises are apparently free from insect pests and plant diseases, and if the necessary inspection fees have been paid, the director shall give or send to the owner of the nursery or of the nursery stock or to the person in charge of the nursery or nursery stock a certificate executed by the director setting forth the fact of the inspection. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Certificates of inspection are valid from November 1 in 1 year to October 31 of the following year. A nursery owner or nursery dealer may request a second inspection be performed, prior to offering for sale or removing or shipping of nursery stock from a nursery or other premises. The department shall perform the inspection if the nursery owner, nursery dealer, or applicant pays an inspection fee based upon the actual cost to the department in conducting the inspection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A person shall not sell, offer for sale, or remove or ship from a nursery or other premises any nursery stock until the nursery stock has been officially inspected and a certificate or permit covering it has been granted by the director, except that nursery stock may be shipped to the director without an inspection and certification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The director shall not grant a certificate of inspection to persons that intend to sell or remove nursery stock originally supplied from the state, federal, or state and federal nurseries or by any political subdivision or its agencies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The director shall charge an inspection fee based upon the cost to the department of making the inspection. However, the director shall adjust the schedule of fees for the costs of making the various inspections of nursery stock, plants, and plant materials as required by this act. The director shall review and adjust its schedule of fees for the inspections at the end of each fiscal year. In any given fiscal year, the director may raise inspection fees by not more than an amount determined by the state treasurer to reflect the cumulative annual percentage change in the Detroit-Ann Arbor-Flint consumer price index over the 1-year period. An adjustment under this subsection shall not exceed 5% even if the amount determined by the state treasurer to reflect the cumulative annual percentage change over the 1-year period is more than 5%. If the cumulative annual percentage change over the 1-year period is less than zero, a cumulative annual percentage change of zero shall be used for the adjustment. The adjustment shall be rounded to the nearest dollar to set each year's fee under this subsection, but the absolute value shall be carried over and used to calculate the next annual adjustment. The commission of agriculture and rural development shall approve all adjustments to the fees before they are adopted.</div>

In any case coming to the attention of the director in which a nurseryman, dealer, plant grower or agent furnishing or selling nursery stock appears to be guilty of fraudulent practice, the director shall have authority to make such investigation as he may deem proper and proceed with such prosecution as may be necessary for the protection of the interests of the buying public, and, in addition, the director may revoke his license.</DIV>

The fee to register as a nursery dealer is $35.00. The annual nursery license fee is $100.00. The annual license fee for plant growers or plant dealers is $100.00. The annual license fee for nursery dealers is $100.00. For persons growing less than 1/4 acre of nursery stock or utilizing less than 200 square feet of greenhouse space, the fee for a license is $40.00. License fees provided for in this act are due and payable at the office of the director on or before October 31 of each year. The fees imposed in this subsection are subject to subsection (8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The agriculture licensing and inspection fees fund is created within the state treasury. The state treasurer may receive license and inspection fees and administrative and civil fines received pursuant to this act and other acts, as provided for by law, that are administered by the department for deposit into the agriculture licensing and inspection fees fund. The state treasurer may also receive money or other assets from any other source for deposit into the agriculture licensing and inspection fees fund. The state treasurer shall direct the investment of the agriculture licensing and inspection fees fund and shall credit to the agriculture licensing and inspection fees fund interest earnings from fund investments. Money in the agriculture licensing and inspection fees fund at the close of the fiscal year must remain in the fund and not lapse to the general fund. The department shall expend money from the agriculture licensing and inspection fees fund, upon appropriation, for the purpose of administering and carrying out those duties required by law under this act and other acts, as provided by law, that are administered by the department. The department shall be the administrator of the agriculture licensing and inspection fees fund for auditing purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Subject to subsection (4), license fees, inspection fees, and other noncriminal fees collected under this section and section 6 and administrative fines imposed under this act must be deposited into the agriculture licensing and inspection fees fund, to be used, upon appropriation, by the director in administering and carrying out those duties required by law under this act and to develop and improve training and outreach programs for the purpose of safeguarding plants or plant products from unwanted plant pests.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The horticulture fund is created within the state treasury. The state treasurer may receive money or other assets from any source for deposit into the horticulture fund. Up to $70,000.00 of the funds generated through licensing may be deposited into the horticulture fund each year. The state treasurer shall direct the investments of the horticulture fund. The state treasurer shall credit interest and earnings from horticulture fund investments to the horticulture fund. Assets in the horticulture fund at the close of the fiscal year must remain in the horticulture fund and not lapse to the general fund. The director shall administer the horticulture fund and shall expend money from the horticulture fund, upon appropriation, to provide for research projects, to develop and improve training programs, and to develop outreach materials for the purposes of safeguarding plants or plant products from unwanted plant pests. The director shall administer the horticulture fund with advice and consultation from the horticultural advisory committee created in subsection (5). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) There is created a horticulture advisory committee. Members of this committee, to be named by the director, must include representatives from the horticulture industry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) This section does not apply to persons engaged in fruit growing that are not nursery growers but desire to sell or exchange surplus small fruit plants of their own growing, or to farmers or other persons that may sell or give away wild shade trees, wild shrubs, wild vines, wild hardy perennials, or wild evergreens from their own premises.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The director shall issue an initial or renewal license under this section not later than 90 days after a completed application for the license is received by the department. If the application is considered incomplete by the director, the director shall notify the applicant in writing, or make the information electronically available, within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The 90-day period is tolled upon notification by the director of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the director. The determination of the completeness of an application does not operate as an approval of the application for the license and does not confer eligibility of an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license. The director shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based upon the fact that the license fee was refunded or discounted under subsection (8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the director fails to issue or deny a license within the time required by this section, the director shall return the license fee and shall reduce the license fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. The failure to issue a license within the time required under this section does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and that application, upon completion, must be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) As used in this section, "completed application" means an application complete on its face and submitted with any applicable licensing and inspection fees as well as any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of this state.</div>

<P>Sec. 20.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the director shall determine that any species or variety of tree, shrub, vine or other plant growing within this state is a host plant nuisance as defined in section 18, and if in the judgment of the director such species or variety of plant should be eradicated from this state or from any section thereof, in order to safeguard the other plants and plant products of the state or any section thereof, he shall give public notice thereof, designating the species or variety of plant, the eradication of which is proposed, the section of the state involved, and the reasons why the eradication of such plant is necessary. The notice shall also designate a place and a time, which time shall not be less than 30 days after the date of such notice, for a public hearing, at which all persons in the state interested in the proposed action of the director may be heard. If after such hearing the director shall determine that such species or variety of plant should be eradicated, he shall give public notice of the fact, naming the species or variety of plant to be eradicated, describing the boundaries of the section of the state from which such species or variety of plant shall be eradicated, and the date when such notice shall become effective. The director shall also give written notice of the facts to any owner, or other person in charge of the property or place where such nuisance is found; which notice shall specify the condition constituting such nuisance and the method by which and the time within which such nuisance shall be abated. The owner or person in charge shall proceed to remove, cut, destroy or otherwise completely eradicate the host plant constituting the nuisance within the time and in the manner described in such notice. Whenever such owner or other person cannot be found, or shall fail, neglect or refuse to obey the requirements of the notice, the director may proceed to abate such nuisance; and in so doing, the director is authorized to treat, remove, cut or destroy the host plant nuisance. Certain plants and plant products included in the classification of host plant nuisances and not actually infested or infected may be permitted by the director to remain without eradication until such time as they become infested or infected.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the director has reason to believe that any article, except one which could serve as a favorable host plant, is a nuisance as defined by section 18 or that such a nuisance, either alone or in combination with a host plant, exists on any premise or area or is in transit in this state, he may inspect or cause to be inspected by a person or device any such article, premise or area. If he finds by inspection that such nuisance exists, he may give notice to the owner, possessor or person in charge of such article or premise, and after expiration of the time stated in the notice, may seize, quarantine, treat or otherwise dispose of such nuisance in a manner deemed necessary to suppress, control, eradicate or to prevent or retard the spread of an insect pest or plant disease, or he may order the owner, possessor or person in charge to so treat or otherwise dispose of the pest or article. The notice shall be given at least 10 days prior to such action and may be given by personal service, mail or newspaper publication as the director deems expedient.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The director may employ the necessary aid in abating any nuisance under this section and he may render a bill against the owner for the expense incurred. If the owner refuses to pay the bill, it shall be certified to the local assessing officer and assessed against the property.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The director of the department of agriculture and his or her inspectors, deputies, assistants, and employees may enter upon any premises in the state for the purpose of examining trees, shrubs, vines, and plants for the presence of destructive insects or diseases, and, if any such insects or diseases are found, may, under the provisions of this act, take the steps as may be necessary to exterminate them. No damage shall be awarded for the destruction of any trees, shrubs, vines, plants, or fruit or for injury to same if done by the director of the department of agriculture or his or her authorized inspectors and assistants, in accordance with the provisions of this act, and the director considers it necessary in order to suppress dangerous insects and diseases, when the trees, shrubs, vines, and plants have already been attacked by dangerous insects or diseases. Whenever any dangerous plant disease, or destructive insect, which is new to or which has not become widely prevalent or distributed through or within the state is found upon any trees, shrubs, vines, or plants, in case it is considered necessary in order to prevent the spread and the dissemination of said insect, or disease, the director of the department of agriculture may cause any tree, shrub, vine, or plant likely to be attacked by such insect or disease, and which are growing within 3,000 feet of where the dangerous insect or disease has been found, to be treated with approved remedies, or, if this is not feasible, to be destroyed. However, if it becomes necessary to destroy any trees, shrubs, vines, or plants which have not already become attacked by said new and dangerous insect or disease, the owner shall be recompensed for their actual value, the amount to be fixed by 3 parties, 1 to be selected by the owner, another by the director of the department of agriculture, and the third party to be selected by the other 2 so selected. The amount awarded, when approved by the director of the department of agriculture, shall be certified to the state treasurer, who shall draw a warrant on the state treasurer for the payment of the same from the general fund of the state.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to subsection (2), the director shall investigate all complaints involving a farm or farm operation, including, but not limited to, complaints involving the use of manure and other nutrients, agricultural waste products, dust, noise, odor, fumes, air pollution, surface water or groundwater pollution, food and agricultural processing by-products, care of farm animals, and pest infestations. Within 7 business days of receipt of the complaint, the director shall conduct an on-site inspection of the farm or farm operation. The director shall notify, in writing, the city, village, or township and the county in which the farm or farm operation is located of the complaint.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The commission and the director shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with the director of the department of environmental quality. The investigation and resolution of environmental complaints concerning farms or farm operations must be conducted in accordance with the memorandum of understanding. However, the director shall notify the department of environmental quality of any potential violation of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.101 to 324.90106, or a rule promulgated under that act. Activities at a farm or farm operation are subject to applicable provisions of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.101 to 324.90106, and the rules promulgated under that act. The commission and the director shall develop procedures for the investigation and resolution for other farm-related complaints.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the director finds upon investigation under subsection (1) that the person responsible for a farm or farm operation is using generally accepted agricultural and management practices, the director shall notify, in writing, that person, the complainant, and the city, village, or township and the county in which the farm or farm operation is located of this finding. If the director identifies that the source or potential sources of the problem were caused by the use of other than generally accepted agricultural and management practices, the director shall advise the person responsible for the farm or farm operation that necessary changes should be made to resolve or abate the problem and to conform with generally accepted agricultural and management practices and that if those changes cannot be implemented within 30 days, the person responsible for the farm or farm operation shall submit to the director an implementation plan including a schedule for completion of the necessary changes. When the director conducts a follow-up on-site inspection to verify whether those changes have been implemented, the director shall notify, in writing, the city, village, or township and the county in which the farm or farm operation is located of the time and date of the follow-up on-site inspection and shall allow a representative of the city, village, or township and the county to be present during the follow-up on-site inspection. If the changes have been implemented, the director shall notify, in writing, the person responsible for the farm or farm operation, the complainant, and the city, village, or township and the county in which the farm or farm operation is located of this determination. If the changes have not been implemented, the director shall notify, in writing, the complainant and the city, village, or township and the county in which the farm or farm operation is located that the changes have not been implemented and whether a plan for implementation has been submitted. Upon request, the director shall provide a copy of the implementation plan to the city, village, or township and the county in which the farm or farm operation is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A complainant who brings more than 3 unverified complaints against the same farm or farm operation within 3 years may be ordered, by the director, to pay to the department the full costs of investigation of any fourth or subsequent unverified complaint against the same farm or farm operation. As used in this subsection, "unverified complaint" means a complaint in response to which the director determines that the farm or farm operation is using generally accepted agricultural and management practices.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as provided in subsection (6), this act does not affect the application of state statutes and federal statutes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Beginning June 1, 2000, except as otherwise provided in this section, it is the express legislative intent that this act preempt any local ordinance, regulation, or resolution that purports to extend or revise in any manner the provisions of this act or generally accepted agricultural and management practices developed under this act. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a local unit of government shall not enact, maintain, or enforce an ordinance, regulation, or resolution that conflicts in any manner with this act or generally accepted agricultural and management practices developed under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A local unit of government may submit to the director a proposed ordinance prescribing standards different from those contained in generally accepted agricultural and management practices if adverse effects on the environment or public health will exist within the local unit of government. A proposed ordinance under this subsection must not conflict with existing state laws or federal laws. At least 45 days prior to enactment of the proposed ordinance, the local unit of government shall submit a copy of the proposed ordinance to the director. Upon receipt of the proposed ordinance, the director shall hold a public meeting in that local unit of government to review the proposed ordinance. In conducting its review, the director shall consult with the departments of environmental quality and health and human services and shall consider any recommendations of the county health department of the county where the adverse effects on the environment or public health will allegedly exist. Within 30 days after the public meeting, the director shall make a recommendation to the commission on whether the ordinance should be approved. An ordinance enacted under this subsection must not be enforced by a local unit of government until approved by the commission. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) By May 1, 2000, the commission shall issue proposed generally accepted agricultural and management practices for site selection and odor controls at new and expanding animal livestock facilities. The commission shall adopt such generally accepted agricultural and management practices by June 1, 2000. In developing these generally accepted agricultural and management practices, the commission shall do both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Establish an advisory committee to provide recommendations to the commission. The advisory committee must include the entities listed in section 2(d), 2 individuals representing townships, 1 individual representing counties, and 2 individuals representing agricultural industry organizations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For the generally accepted agricultural and management practices for site selection, consider groundwater protection, soil permeability, and other factors determined necessary or appropriate by the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If generally accepted agricultural and management practices require the person responsible for the operation of a farm or farm operation to prepare a manure management plan, the person responsible for the operation of the farm or farm operation shall provide a copy of that manure management plan to the city, village, or township or the county in which the farm or farm operation is located, upon request. A manure management plan provided under this subsection is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The department shall do both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Make available on the department's website current generally accepted agricultural and management practices.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Establish a toll-free telephone number for receipt of information on noncompliance with generally accepted agricultural and management practices.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Adverse effects on the environment or public health" means any unreasonable risk to human beings or the environment, based on scientific evidence and taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits and specific populations whose health may be adversely affected.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) In the absence of the higher degree of cooperation among them possible under this compact, the annual loss of approximately 7 billion dollars from the depredations of pests is virtually certain to continue, if not to increase.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Because of varying climatic, geographic and economic factors, each state may be affected differently by particular species of pests; but all states share the inability to protect themselves fully against those pests which present serious dangers to them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The migratory character of pest infestations makes it necessary for states both adjacent to and distant from one another, to complement each other's activities when faced with conditions of infestation and reinfestation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) While every state is seriously affected by a substantial number of pests, and every state is susceptible of infestation by many species of pests not now causing damage to its crop and plant life and products, the fact that relatively few species of pests present equal danger to or are of interest to all states makes the establishment and operation of an insurance fund, from which individual states may obtain financial support for pest control programs of benefit to them in other states and to which they may contribute in accordance with their relative interests, the most equitable means of financing cooperative pest eradication and control programs.

Upon such authorization the responding state or states shall take or increase such eradication or control measures as may be warranted. A responding state shall use moneys made available from the insurance fund expeditiously and efficiently to assist in affording the protection requested.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>4.Proof that the expenditures being made or budgeted as detailed in item 3 do not constitute a reduction of the effort for the control or eradication of the pest concerned or, if there is a reduction, the reasons why the level of program detailed in item 3 constitutes a normal level of pest control activity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>5.A declaration as to whether, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the conditions which in its view occasion the invoking of the compact in the particular instance can be abated by a program undertaken with the aid of moneys from the insurance fund in 1 year or less, or whether the request is for an installment in a program which is likely to continue for a longer period of time.</div>

The governing board or the executive committee may meet at any time or place for the purpose of receiving and considering an application. Any and all determinations of the governing board or executive committee, with respect to an application, together with the reasons therefor shall be recorded and subscribed in such manner as to show and preserve the votes of the individual members thereof.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A requesting state which is dissatisfied with a determination of the executive committee shall upon notice in writing given within 20 days of the determination with which it is dissatisfied, be entitled to receive a review thereof at the next meeting of the governing board. Determinations of the executive committee shall be reviewable only by the governing board at one of its regular meetings, or at a special meeting held in such manner as the governing board may authorize.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Responding states required to undertake or increase measures pursuant to this compact may receive moneys from the insurance fund, either at the time or times when such state incurs expenditures on account of such measures, or as reimbursement for expenses incurred and chargeable to the insurance fund. The governing board shall adopt and, from time to time, may amend or revise procedures for submission of claims upon it and for payment thereof.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Before authorizing the expenditure of moneys from the insurance fund pursuant to an application of a requesting state, the insurance fund shall ascertain the extent and nature of any timely assistance or participation which may be available from the federal government and shall request the appropriate agency or agencies of the federal government for such assistance and participation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The insurance fund may negotiate and execute a memorandum of understanding or other appropriate instrument defining the extent and degree of assistance or participation between and among the insurance fund, cooperating federal agencies, states and any other entities concerned.

<P>Sec. 8a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the division has provided the owner of 1 or more colonies not less than 30 days to remedy a bee disease within the colony or colonies and determines that the control or eradication of bee disease warrants the destruction of 1 or more colonies, the division shall order, in writing, the destruction of those colonies except that in the case of the destruction of colonies infected with American foulbrood disease, the division shall order their destruction in the manner provided for in section 8.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The division shall indemnify the owner of a colony in the amount of 75% of the fair market value of a colony as of the date of destruction, less any compensation received from any source including, but not limited to, compensation for salvage value. Fair market value shall be determined by evidence of sales of similar colonies within the 12 months immediately preceding the date of destruction of the colonies. The owner of the colony shall furnish an affidavit attesting to compensation received, if any, from any other source.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Indemnification pursuant to this section shall be subject to annual appropriations by the legislature and shall not be paid from department of agriculture funds designated for any other purpose. An agreement between the department of agriculture and an owner of the colonies shall contain a provision specifying that, notwithstanding the terms of the agreement, indemnification is subject to appropriations by the legislature.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Acceptance of indemnification under this section operates as a release of the claim of the owner against the state but does not enlarge or diminish the owner's civil remedy against a person responsible for the owner's loss.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The department of agriculture shall not indemnify the owner of a colony acquired by the owner with knowledge that the colony is diseased or that it may have been exposed to a bee disease.</DIV>
