<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The commissioner, upon 10 days' written notice to the licensee stating the contemplated action and the grounds for the action, and upon reasonable opportunity to be heard, may revoke any license if he or she finds any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The licensee has failed, after 5 days' written notice of default, to pay the annual operating fee, to maintain the bond required under this act, or to comply with any demand, ruling, or requirement of the commissioner made under this act.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Any fact or condition that exists which, if it had existed at the time of the original application for the license, would have warranted the commissioner in refusing originally to issue the license.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the commissioner finds that probable cause for revocation of any license exists and that the enforcement of the act requires immediate suspension of the license pending investigation, he or she may, upon 3 days' written notice and a hearing, suspend any license for a period not exceeding 30 days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A licensee may surrender its license by delivering to the commissioner written notice that it surrenders the license. The surrender does not affect the licensee's civil or criminal liability for acts committed before the surrender.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A revocation or suspension or surrender of a license does not impair or affect the obligation of any preexisting lawful contract between the licensee and any borrower.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The commissioner shall have authority to reinstate suspended licenses or to issue new licenses to a licensee whose license shall have been revoked if no fact or condition exists that clearly would have warranted the commissioner in refusing originally to issue the license.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 12c.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the commissioner has probable cause to believe that a licensee has engaged, is engaged, or is about to engage in advertising that is false, misleading, deceptive, or irresponsible as defined in section 12a, and upon notice given in accordance with this section, the commissioner shall report the matter to the attorney general. The attorney general or the commissioner may bring an action to restrain the licensee by temporary or permanent injunction from engaging in the advertising. The action may be brought in the circuit court for the county where the licensee is established or conducts business or in the circuit court for Ingham county. The court may award costs to the prevailing party. For persistent and knowing violation of section 12a the court may assess the defendant a civil penalty of not more than $5,000.00.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Unless waived by the court on good cause shown, not less than 10 days before the commencement of a proceeding under this section the commissioner shall notify the licensee of the intended referral to the attorney general and provide the licensee an opportunity to cease and desist from the alleged unlawful advertising or to confer with the commissioner in person, by counsel, or by other representative as to the proposed action before the proposed filing date.</DIV>

The assurance does not constitute an admission of guilt nor can it be introduced in any other proceeding. An assurance of discontinuance shall be in writing and filed with the circuit court for Ingham county. The clerk of the court shall maintain a record of the filings. Unless rescinded by the parties or voided by the court for good cause, the assurance may be enforced in the circuit court by the parties to the assurance. The assurance may be modified by the parties or by the court for good cause.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A closed-end loan.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Open-end credit consisting of direct advances from the licensee or checks issued by the licensee. This subdivision does not apply to open-end credit available through the use of a credit card or charge card.</DIV>

The $250.00 limit on the loan processing fee shall be adjusted every 2 years to reflect the percentage change in the United States consumer price index for the 2 immediately preceding calendar years, rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. As used in this subsection, "United States consumer price index" means the United States consumer price index for all urban consumers in the United States city average, as defined and reported by the United States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics, and after certification by the commissioner. A licensee may require the borrower to pay the late charges permitted by the credit reform act, 1995 PA 162, MCL 445.1851 to 445.1864. A licensee shall not induce or permit a person to become obligated, directly or contingently, under more than 1 loan contract not secured by personal property at the same time for the purpose or with the result of obtaining a loan processing fee not otherwise permitted by this section. No other amount shall be directly or indirectly charged, contracted for, or received, except the lawful fees, if any, actually and necessarily paid by the licensee to a governmental entity for the filing, recording, or releasing of either of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A financing statement or an instrument securing the loan, or both.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A record noting or releasing a lien or transferring a certificate of title under the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.1 to 257.923.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The fees permitted under this section may be collected at any time on or after the date the loan is made.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A licensee may recover from the borrower the costs and expenses of retaking, holding, repairing, preparing for sale, and selling any personal property in accordance with sections 9609 and 9615 of the uniform commercial code, 1962 PA 174, MCL 440.9609 and 440.9615.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   A licensee may charge a reasonable annual fee for the privilege of receiving open-end credit from the licensee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   A licensee may charge a reasonable fee per payment if a borrower makes a payment or payments by authorizing a licensee verbally or in writing to execute a debit or otherwise process a payment, through automated clearing procedures, drawn on the borrower's deposit account.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Fees received under this act are not refundable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If any fees or penalties provided for in this act are not paid when required, the attorney general may maintain an action against the delinquent licensee or registrant for the recovery of the fees and penalties together with interest and costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A licensee or registrant that fails to submit to the commissioner the reports as required by subsections (2) and (13) is subject to a penalty of $25.00 for each day a required report is delinquent or $1,000.00, whichever is less.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The annual operating fees set by the commissioner shall not exceed the levels needed to cover the estimated cost of enforcement of this act. </div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Notwithstanding section 12, if the commissioner determines that a licensee or registrant is, intentionally or as a result of gross or wanton negligence, not servicing secondary mortgage loans as required by this act or the terms of the servicing contracts, the commissioner may appoint a conservator for the licensee or registrant and require the conservator to provide a bond or security as the commissioner considers necessary.

The licensee or registrant may transfer or assign the rights to service secondary mortgage loans to a person approved by the commissioner. The conservator of the licensee or registrant shall take such action as may be necessary to assure that the secondary mortgage loans are serviced as required by this act and the servicing contracts.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the commissioner is satisfied that termination of the conservatorship may be done safely and is in the public interest, the commissioner may terminate the conservatorship and permit the licensee or registrant to resume the servicing of secondary mortgage loans subject to any terms, conditions, and limitations as prescribed by the commissioner.</DIV>
