<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The school district or state approved nonpublic school in which an eligible student is enrolled shall provide to the eligible student a letter signed by the student's principal indicating the student's eligibility under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An eligible student may apply to an eligible postsecondary institution to enroll in 1 or more eligible courses offered by that eligible postsecondary institution and, if accepted, may enroll in 1 or more of those courses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For an eligible student enrolled in a school district, within a reasonable time after registration, the eligible postsecondary institution shall send written notice to the eligible student and his or her school district. For an eligible student enrolled in a state approved nonpublic school, within a reasonable time after registration, the eligible postsecondary institution shall send written notice to the eligible student and his or her state approved nonpublic school and to the department. The notice must indicate the course or courses and hours of enrollment of that eligible student. The eligible postsecondary institution shall notify the eligible student about tuition, fees, books, materials, and other related charges, as determined by the postsecondary institution, in the customary manner used by the eligible postsecondary institution, and shall notify the eligible student of the estimated amount of the eligible charges that will be billed to the school district or the department, as applicable, under subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) For an eligible student enrolled in a school district, unless otherwise agreed between the eligible postsecondary institution and the school district, after the expiration of the institution's drop/add period for the course, an eligible postsecondary institution shall send a bill to the eligible student's school district detailing the eligible charges for each eligible course in which the eligible student is enrolled under this act.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) For an eligible student enrolled in a school district, upon receiving the bill under subsection (4), the school district shall cause to be paid to the eligible postsecondary institution on behalf of the eligible student an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of the eligible charges or the prorated percentage of the statewide pupil-weighted average foundation allowance, as calculated under this subsection and section 20 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1620, for all school districts for the state fiscal year that begins on October 1 immediately preceding the academic year of enrollment in the eligible postsecondary institution, with the proration based on the proportion of the school year that the eligible student attends the eligible postsecondary institution. In determining the proportion of the school year that an eligible student attends an eligible postsecondary institution under this subsection, a school district shall take into account, according to guidelines published by the department under subsection (16), an eligible student's attendance at an eligible postsecondary institution for an eligible course that occurs in whole or in part when the school district is not in session during the summer immediately following that regularly scheduled school year. However, in the calculation of the statewide pupil-weighted average foundation allowance for the purposes of this subsection, if a school district's foundation allowance is above the target foundation allowance under section 20 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1620, then the school district's foundation allowance must be considered to be the target foundation allowance. Not later than September 1 of each year, the department shall notify the department of treasury of the amount of the statewide pupil-weighted average foundation allowance as calculated for the purposes of this subsection. A school district may pay more money to an eligible postsecondary institution on behalf of an eligible student than is required under this act, and may use local school operating revenue for that purpose. The eligible student is responsible for payment of the remainder of the costs associated with his or her postsecondary enrollment that exceed the amount the school district is required to pay under this act and that are not paid by the school district. As used in this subsection, "local school operating revenue" means that term as defined in section 20 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1620.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For an eligible student who is enrolled in a state approved nonpublic school, upon receiving from the department under subsection (4) the amount of the eligible charges to be paid on behalf of the eligible student, the department of treasury shall cause to be paid to the eligible postsecondary institution on behalf of the eligible student an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of the eligible charges or the prorated percentage of the statewide pupil-weighted average foundation allowance, as calculated under this subsection and section 20 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1620, for all school districts for the state fiscal year that begins on October 1 immediately preceding the academic year of enrollment in the eligible postsecondary institution, with the proration based on the proportion of the school year that the eligible student attends the eligible postsecondary institution. In determining the proportion of the school year that an eligible student attends an eligible postsecondary institution under this subsection, the department shall take into account, according to guidelines published by the department under subsection (16), an eligible student's attendance at an eligible postsecondary institution for an eligible course that occurs in whole or in part when the state approved nonpublic school is not in session during the summer immediately following that regularly scheduled school year. However, in the calculation of the statewide pupil-weighted average foundation allowance for the purposes of this subsection, if a school district's foundation allowance is above the target foundation allowance under section 20 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1620, then the school district's foundation allowance must be considered to be the target foundation allowance. Not later than September 1 of each year, the department shall notify the department of treasury of the amount of the statewide pupil-weighted average foundation allowance as calculated for the purposes of this subsection. The eligible student is responsible for payment of the remainder of the costs associated with his or her postsecondary enrollment that exceed the amount the department of treasury is required to pay under this act and that are not paid by the department of treasury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An eligible postsecondary institution shall not charge a late fee to an eligible student, a school district, the department, or the department of treasury for a payment that is made in compliance with the timetable prescribed under this act even if the payment would otherwise be considered late by the postsecondary institution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A school district, state approved nonpublic school, or the department may require an eligible student to provide, on a form supplied by the school district, state approved nonpublic school, or the department, reasonable verification that the eligible student is regularly attending a postsecondary course.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) For an eligible student who is enrolled in a school district and who enrolls in an eligible course under this act, if the student does not complete the eligible course or, if the student enrolls in an eligible course for postsecondary credit only and the student does not successfully complete the eligible course, as determined by the eligible postsecondary institution, and if the school district has paid money for the course on behalf of the student, both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The eligible postsecondary institution shall forward to the school district any funds that are refundable due to noncompletion of the course. The school district shall then forward to the eligible student any refunded money in excess of the amount paid by the school district for the course on behalf of the eligible student.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The eligible student shall repay to the school district any funds that were expended by the school district for the course that are not refunded to the school district by the eligible postsecondary institution. If the eligible student does not repay this money, the school district may impose sanctions against the eligible student as determined by school district policy. This subdivision does not apply to an eligible student who does not complete the course due to a family or medical emergency, as determined by the eligible postsecondary institution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) For an eligible student who is enrolled in a state approved nonpublic school, and who enrolls in an eligible course under this act, if the eligible student does not complete the eligible course or, if the eligible student enrolls in an eligible course for postsecondary credit only and the eligible student does not successfully complete the eligible course, as determined by the eligible postsecondary institution, and if the department of treasury has paid money for the course on behalf of the eligible student, both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The eligible postsecondary institution shall forward to the department of treasury any funds that are refundable due to noncompletion of the course. If applicable, the eligible postsecondary institution shall then refund to the eligible student any funds that are refundable due to noncompletion of the course and are in excess of the amount paid by the department of treasury for the course on behalf of the eligible student.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The eligible student shall repay to the department of treasury any funds that were expended by the department of treasury for the course that are not refunded to the department of treasury by the eligible postsecondary institution. This subdivision does not apply to an eligible student who does not complete the course due to a family or medical emergency, as determined by the eligible postsecondary institution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A school district, state approved nonpublic school, the department, or the department of treasury shall make available to an eligible student copies of all correspondence in the possession of the school district, state approved nonpublic school, department, or department of treasury regarding the eligible student's participation in postsecondary enrollment under this act. The school district, state approved nonpublic school, department, or department of treasury shall keep correspondence described in this subsection for at least 1 year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If a school district pays for books for an eligible student for a postsecondary course under this section, the books are the property of the school district and must be turned over to the school district after the eligible student completes the course.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) This section does not apply to any postsecondary courses in which an eligible student is enrolled in addition to being enrolled full-time in that eligible student's school district or state approved nonpublic school; to a postsecondary course an eligible student is retaking after failing to achieve a satisfactory grade; or to a course contrary to the eligibility provisions of this act. In determining full-time enrollment in a school district under this section or a school district's full-time equated membership under the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1601 to 388.1897l, for a pupil enrolled in a postsecondary institution under this act, the pupil's enrollment in both the school district and the postsecondary institution must be counted as enrollment in the school district and a pupil is not considered to be enrolled in a school district less than full-time solely because of the effect of the pupil's postsecondary enrollment, including necessary travel time, on the number of class hours provided by the school district to the pupil. In determining full-time enrollment in a state approved nonpublic school under this section for a student enrolled in a postsecondary institution under this act, the student's enrollment in both the state approved nonpublic school and the postsecondary institution must be counted as enrollment in the state approved nonpublic school and a student is not considered to be enrolled in a state approved nonpublic school less than full-time solely because of the effect of the student's postsecondary enrollment under this act, including necessary travel time, on the number of class hours provided by the state approved nonpublic school to the student.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) This act does not require a school district or the department of treasury to pay or otherwise provide financial support for transportation or parking costs necessary for an eligible student to participate in postsecondary enrollment under this act. A school district, state approved nonpublic school, or this state is not liable for any injury incurred by an eligible student that is related to transportation necessary for the eligible student to participate in postsecondary enrollment under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) The legislature shall appropriate funds to the department of treasury for making payments required to be made by the department of treasury under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) By September 1, 2020, the department shall publish guidelines regarding how to determine the prorated percentage of the statewide pupil-weighted average foundation allowance under subsections (5) and (6).

The board of the reorganized or successor district shall certify and order the levy of taxes for the bonded indebtedness in the name of the original district, shall not commingle the debt retirement funds of the original district with funds of the reorganized or successor district and shall do all things relative to such bonded indebtedness required by law and by the terms under which the issue and sale of the bonds were originally authorized. All other tax levies for purposes of the reorganized district shall be spread over the entire area of the reorganized district.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Any time after 3 years following reorganization, the reorganized district, or that district which has succeeded to the largest share of the attached district's state equalized valuation, may assume the obligation of the bonded indebtedness incurred after December 8, 1932, of the original district which has become a part of the reorganization and pay the same from the proceeds of a debt retirement tax levy spread uniformly over the territory of the reorganized or successor district whenever the electors of the reorganized or successor district shall have approved an increase in the limitation on taxes for that purpose and the school tax electors of the district have approved the assumption of such bonded indebtedness. Assumption of the bonded indebtedness of an original school district shall not release the territory of the original district from the final responsibility of paying the obligation or rescind the increase in the limitation on taxes pledged to the bond issue or available to it in the original district, nor be construed as so doing. When the bonded indebtedness of an original district has been so assumed, the board of the reorganized or successor district shall certify and order the levy of taxes for the bonded indebtedness equivalent in terms of money to those required by the terms under which the indebtedness was originally incurred and carry out all provisions of the original bond contract. The election to assume the bonded indebtedness of an attached district may be held at any time after 3 years following the effective date of reorganization when a proposal is placed before the school tax electors to increase the bonded indebtedness of the combined district.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) All plans and specifications for buildings shall be prepared by an architect or professional engineer who is licensed in this state. An architect or professional engineer licensed in this state or another person qualified to supervise construction shall supervise the construction of a school building. For energy conservation improvements and services under section 1274a of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1274a, the licensed architect or professional engineer may be directly affiliated with the qualified provider, as defined under that section, that is providing the applicable improvements and services. However, the specifications for the project shall be generic in character and, to the extent possible, shall not include proprietary equipment or technology developed by the qualified provider or in which the qualified provider has an interest.</div>

This requirement does not prohibit the use of finished wood flooring, wood door and window frames, wood sash, or wood furring and grounds, for the purpose of installing wood trim, panelling, acoustical units, or similar facing materials on masonry walls, structural steel, or concrete ceiling members.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Every room enclosing a heating unit shall be enclosed by walls of fire-resisting materials and shall be equipped with automatically closing fire doors. A heating unit shall not be located directly beneath any portion of a school building or addition that is constructed or reconstructed after January 1, 2003. This requirement does not require the removal of an existing heating plant from beneath an existing building when an addition to the building is constructed unless the department requires that removal in the interests of the public safety. In any school where natural gas or any other kind of gas is used for heating purposes, the gas shall be chemically treated before being used in such a manner as to give a very distinguishable odor if a leak develops in the heating system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) In a gymnasium, fire-proofings may be omitted from the trusses and purlins if they are more than 16 feet off the main floor level.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The architect or engineer shall provide adequate exits from all parts of a school building. In all cases, there shall be at least 2 stairways and the distance from the door of any class or assembly room to a stairway or exit shall not exceed 100 feet.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) A requirement in subdivisions (b) to (f) may be waived in writing by the department.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The people of the state of Michigan by constitutional amendments having authorized the state to borrow not to exceed $100,000,000.00, pledge its faith and credit and issue its bonds or notes therefor, for the purpose of making loans to school districts for the payment of principal and interest on school bonds heretofore or hereafter issued on certain conditions, the state administrative board is hereby authorized and directed to borrow on the full faith and credit of the state, from time to time, moneys not to exceed said aggregate sum, and to issue serial bonds of the state therefor. The amount to be borrowed from time to time shall not be less than such amount as shall be certified in writing by the superintendent of public instruction as being in his opinion necessary to provide funds for such loans to school districts over the next ensuing 2 calendar years. Such bonds shall be designated school loan bonds, and may be issued in series from time to time as moneys are needed for such school loan purposes, with different dates of issuance for each such series, and the state administrative board may from time to time determine and by resolution prescribe, the date of issue of each such series, the amount of bonds to be included in such series, the maturities of such bonds so included, the maximum rate or rates of interest on the bonds, the place or places of payment thereof, and provisions relative to registration of bonds, if any. Such bonds or any portion thereof may be made subject to redemption prior to maturity upon such terms as may be prescribed prior to the issuance of the bonds by resolution of said state administrative board. Said bonds shall be executed for and on behalf of the state of Michigan by the state treasurer and the secretary of state, or their deputies, and the seal of the state shall be affixed thereto by the secretary of state. Interest coupons evidencing accrued interest to the respective dates of maturity of said bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the state treasurer. The bonds herein authorized to be issued shall be sold by the state administrative board, at not less than par and accrued interest. Such sale or sales shall be public sales held from time to time at the discretion of the said state administrative board, after notice by publication at least 5 days before each such sale, in a publication printed in the English language and circulated in the state of Michigan which carries as part of its regular service, notices of sale of municipal bonds. The bonds so sold at each such sale shall be awarded to the bidder whose bid in the opinion of said state administrative board would result in the lowest interest cost to the state.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The principal and interest on any issue of school district bonds issued prior to May 4, 1955, shall be automatically included in computing the amount to be loaned by the state under said section 27 and this act, but the principal and interest on any issue of school district bonds issued on or after May 4, 1955, shall not be included in making such computation, unless the said bonds have been qualified therefor by the superintendent of public instruction, which bonds, including both those automatically qualified and those qualified by the superintendent of public instruction, are sometimes hereinafter referred to as "qualified bonds". No issue of bonds shall be qualified by the superintendent of public instruction unless he shall find as follows, to-wit:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;1.   That the last maturity date on such issue of bonds is not less than 25 years from the issuance date appearing thereon and that the yearly principal maturity date is not less than 6 months after the major part of the taxes therefor become by law a lien upon the property assessed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.   That the amount of principal maturing in any calendar year is not less than two-thirds of the amount of principal maturing in any prior calendar year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;3.   That the cost of the project for which the bonds are to be issued is within such reasonable standards of costs as shall have been established by the state board of education, which standards may vary as to different localities in accordance with any variance in construction costs as between such localities.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;4.   That the project is designed to provide classrooms and furnishings, with the facilities necessarily connected therewith, including site, and is adequate for that purpose. A classroom is a room primarily used for teaching courses of study. Without limiting the foregoing, swimming pools, athletic fields and athletic stadiums shall not be deemed to be classrooms or primarily used for teaching courses of study. In addition, gymnasiums and auditoriums shall not be deemed to be classrooms except in those cases in which the school district provides adequate proof that the gymnasium and/or auditorium is necessary and will be used primarily for regularly scheduled instructional purposes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;5.   That there exists a need for the project based upon current and probable future enrollment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;6.   That there is reasonable evidence that the project will not hinder school district reorganization in the area in the foreseeable future.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;7.   That the project shall be for the purpose of construction of 6 or more classrooms, unless the superintendent of public instruction shall determine and certify that circumstances of location, or topography, or transportation, or population density are clearly such as to warrant construction of a school building or addition of a lesser number of classrooms.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Provided, That if any project shall exceed the above limitations as to cost and/or purpose, the bonds therefor may be qualified by the superintendent of public instruction to the extent of that percentage which represents the percentage of the project cost which is within such limitations. If the superintendent of public instruction shall find as aforesaid, then he shall issue his certificate setting forth such findings and certifying that the bonds, or such percentage thereof, are qualified under the terms of said section 27 and this act, and that the minimum amount necessary to be levied in any calendar year for principal and interest on the bonds or such portion as may be qualified after deducting any funds pledged to and available for the payment thereof, shall be included in computing the amount, if any, to be loaned by the state under said section 27 and this act. In the case of refunding bonds issued on or after May 4, 1955, to refund bonds issued prior to May 4, 1955, the superintendent of public instruction shall issue his certificate of qualification if he finds that such refunding bonds comply with the qualifications set forth in paragraphs numbered 1 and 2 of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In the case of refunding bonds to refund obligations originally incurred on or after May 4, 1955, the superintendent of public instruction shall not issue his certificate of qualification therefor unless the bonds representing the original indebtedness had been qualified by him. All such certificates shall be kept in a permanent file in the office of the superintendent of public instruction, and copies thereof shall be delivered to the school district and to the office of the municipal finance commission. Application for such a certificate of qualification shall be made on forms prepared and supplied by the superintendent of public instruction. He shall prescribe reasonable rules and regulations in respect thereto. If prior to the issuance of bonds, the school district does not secure such certificate of qualification from the superintendent of public instruction, it shall be deemed to have waived the right to have such bonds so qualified.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In any school district where the amount necessary to be levied in any calendar year for principal and interest on qualified bonds, shall exceed 13 mills on each dollar of its assessed valuation as last equalized by the state, such school district on or before 60 days prior to the time of the certification of its tax levy to the assessing officer, may file with the superintendent of public instruction a preliminary application for a loan from the state: Provided, That if the excess over 13 mills is reached or increased by reason of bonds voted within said 60 day period, an original or amended application shall be filed within said period. Such application shall set forth the amount of the last state equalized valuation of the school district, the amount of principal and interest on qualified bonds necessary to be levied upon the tax roll of such year, the amount of any moneys on hand pledged to and available for the payment of such principal and interest, the probable delinquency in tax collections at the times such principal and interest will become due, the estimated amount of the loan which will be required from the state and any other pertinent facts which may be required to be included therein by the superintendent of public instruction. The superintendent of public instruction shall examine said application as soon as possible and notify the school district of any erroneous statements or assumptions therein. If a loan from the state shall become necessary for the payment of such principal and interest, then the school district shall file a supplemental application with the superintendent of public instruction setting forth the amount of the tax collections to the date of said application, an estimate of probable collections prior to the time when such principal and interest will become due and the amount of the loan necessary from the state. Such supplemental application shall be made not less than 30 days prior to the time when the proceeds of the loan will be necessary in order to pay maturing principal and/or interest. Upon receipt of such supplemental application it shall be the duty of the superintendent of public instruction after auditing the same, to forward to the state treasurer a statement setting forth the amount to be loaned to the school district for the payment of principal and interest and the date on or before which such loan shall be made. He shall also prepare the proper voucher as a basis for the issuance of the necessary warrant in accordance with state accounting practices. Upon receipt of such statement and warrant, it shall be the duty of the state treasurer to loan to the school district from "the school bond loan fund" the amount set forth in the statement of the superintendent of public instruction on or before the date specified therein. The state treasurer upon the making of said loan shall obtain from the school district a receipt for the amount so loaned, which receipt shall specify the terms of repayment in accordance with the provisions of said section 27 and this act. Upon receipt by any school district of such a loan it shall be the duty of the treasurer thereof to cause the same to be deposited in the debt retirement fund and used solely for the payment of principal and interest on qualified bonds.</DIV>

The superintendent of public instruction shall annually certify to the several borrowing districts the rate of interest to be currently collected. The proceeds of each such levy shall be used first, for the payment of the minimum principal and interest requirements on the qualified bonds which shall become due prior to the time of the next tax collection, and any balance shall be paid to the state until the principal and interest due the state shall have been paid.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 3.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   For the prompt payment of the principal and interest upon each bond or note issued under this act, the full faith and credit of the state are pledged, and there is appropriated each year during the life of these bonds or notes from the general fund a sufficient amount to pay the principal and interest on the bonds or notes maturing each year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For the 1990-91 state fiscal year only, there is appropriated from the general fund a sufficient amount to pay in full the principal and interest upon each of the bonds or notes issued under this act, including the defeasance of the principal and interest and any redemption premium on each bond or note that matures after September 30, 1991. However, the state treasurer shall expend money from this appropriation for the defeasance of the principal and interest and any redemption premium on a bond or note that matures after September 30, 1991 only to the extent the state administrative board provides by resolution for that defeasance to be made from this appropriation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Loan repayments deposited in the general fund pursuant to section 4 on the settlement date, as determined under section 9c of 1961 PA 108, MCL 388.959c, shall be used as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   For fiscal year 2003-2004, an amount determined by the state treasurer to be equal to the difference between the outstanding amount of general obligation debt incurred pursuant to this act and the outstanding amount of loans under 1961 PA 108, MCL 388.951 to 388.963, immediately preceding the settlement date, as reduced in accordance with section 9c(1) of 1961 PA 108, MCL 388.959c, is appropriated to the state school aid fund. This appropriation shall be used to make state school aid payments to school districts within 90 days after the settlement date.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   For fiscal year 2003-2004, there is appropriated from the general fund to the state school aid fund an amount equal to the amount of all school bond loan fund repayments that are received by the state treasurer from June 1, 2003 through the settlement date, that are determined by the state treasurer not to have been paid from proceeds of bonds of the school district, and that represent the difference between the outstanding amount of general obligation debt incurred by this state under this act and the outstanding amount of loans under 1961 PA 108, MCL 388.951 to 388.963, at the time of repayment. This appropriation shall be used to make state school aid payments to school districts within 90 days after the settlement date.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The state treasurer shall use the balance of the deposits, if any, within 90 days after the settlement date to pay or prepay outstanding general obligation debt incurred under this act.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, pursuant to Article 8, Section 3 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 the State Board of Education provides leadership and general supervision over public education, including adult education and instructional programs in state institutions, serves as the general planning and coordinating body for all public education, including higher education, and advises the legislature as to financial requests in connection therewith; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, as explained in the Address to the People accompanying Article 8, Section 3, the State Board of Education was to provide its constitutional leadership by being a state level policy-making body which was to emphasize two fundamental principles: (1) the concern of all people in the educational processes as a safeguard for democracy, and (2) greater public participation in the operation of educational institutions; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, the State Board of Education provides its constitutional general supervision by developing and creating general guidelines and standards by which public education is provided; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, as reflected in the Address to the People accompanying Article 8, Section 3, the State Board of Education exercises its constitutional general planning and coordinating authority by being the unifying and coordinating force for education within the state, by receiving and considering information from all levels of public education, and by advising local school boards, governing boards of colleges and universities and the legislature as to the total needs of education in this state; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, the Department of Education was created as an executive department of state government by section 300 of Act No. 380 of the Public Acts of 1965, being section 16.400 of the Michigan Compiled Laws; and</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, it is in the interest of the efficient administration of government for an executive department to be headed by a single executive; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, because staff reductions at the Department of Education resulting from implementation of the state early retirement program may equal 10% of the Department's total staff, it will be necessary for the Department to analyze its organizational structure and prioritize its functions, which may best be accomplished by a single executive; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, through the effects of this Order the State Board of Education will be alleviated from many statutory administrative functions which unnecessarily burden the time of the Board, thereby allowing the Board to continue its esteemed and focused leadership, general supervision, planning and coordinating for public education.</div>

</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, Section 1 of Article V of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 vests the executive power of the State of Michigan in the Governor;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, Section 2 of Article V of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 empowers the Governor to make changes in the organization of the executive branch of state government or in the assignment of functions among its units that the Governor considers necessary for efficient administration;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, Section 3 of Article VIII of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 vests leadership and general supervision over all public education, including adult education and instructional programs in state institutions, except as to institutions of higher education granting baccalaureate degrees, in an elected State Board of Education;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, 1999 PA 10 removed the elected school board for the Detroit Public School District and replaced the board with an appointed board consisting of six appointees and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, 1999 PA 10 also created within the Department of Education a School District Accountability Board consisting of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the State Treasurer, the State Budget Director, and two persons appointed by Governor John M. Engler to review district improvement plans submitted by the appointed school board and monitor any progress being made in achieving goals and benchmarks under the plan;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, under 1999 PA 10, the powers of the School District Accountability Board were limited to a qualifying school district in which an appointed school reform board is in place, such as the board appointed for the Detroit Public School District in 1999;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, the takeover of the Detroit Public School District by an appointed board mandated under 1999 PA 10 was a failure, resulting in a $198 million deficit during Fiscal Year 2005;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, 2003 PA 303 amended 1990 PA 10 to end the state takeover of the Detroit Public School District, allowing Detroit voters, rather than Lansing lawmakers, to determine the powers of the Detroit School Board and what is best for their schools and their children;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, when given a choice, Detroit voters chose to govern their school district by an elected board in the same manner as other districts throughout this state, and the elected board they selected is now in place;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, return to an elected school board for Detroit Public Schools eliminates the need for a special School District Accountability Board to provide state oversight of an appointed board for the Detroit Public School District;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, the functions of the School District Accountability Board are best vested in elected officials directly accountable to the public;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, it is necessary in the interests of efficient administration and effectiveness of government to change the organization of the executive branch of state government;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>NOW THEREFORE, I, Jennifer M. Granholm, Governor of the State of Michigan, by virtue of the power and authority vested in me by the Michigan Constitution of 1963 and Michigan law, order the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Every Michigander deserves a path to prosperity. They deserve to explore, learn, grow, and develop the skills they need to thrive. That's why I am focused on building a bright future for Michigan by making strategic decisions and investments now for the long-term.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>For too long, Michigan has fallen behind other states and countries when it comes to student achievement and attainment, impacting the state's workforce and economic growth. We know that today, more than ever, building a skilled workforce is not a matter of a single certificate, course, or credential. It's a generational project that will require a shared vision, effective decision-making, and strategic resource allocation to ensure that each and every person has the best opportunity to thrive.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>In other words—we must support lifelong education, achievement, and potential. Consolidating various programs from across state government into a single department will enhance our ability to create a path to prosperity for every Michigander and support the long-term economic health of our state with a coordinated strategy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Establishing the Michigan Department of Lifelong Education, Advancement, and Potential, or MiLEAP, ensures all available resources, data, and dollars are aligned around a single vision—building an education system from preschool through postsecondary that can support our kids, families, and the economy of the future by ensuring anyone can make it in Michigan.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Provide a forum for the discussion, development, crystallization and recommendation of public policy alternatives in the field of education.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Provide a clearing house of information on matters relating to educational problems and how they are being met in different places throughout the nation, so that the executive and legislative branches of state government and of local communities may have ready access to the experience and record of the entire country, and so that both lay and professional groups in the field of education may have additional avenues for the sharing of experience and the interchange of ideas in the formation of public policy in education.</div>

No action of the commission shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the commission are cast in favor thereof. Action of the commission shall be only at a meeting at which a majority of the commissioners are present. The commission shall meet at least once a year. In its bylaws, and subject to such directions and limitations as may be contained therein, the commission may delegate the exercise of any of its powers to the steering committee or the executive director, except for the power to approve budgets or requests for appropriations, the power to make policy recommendations pursuant to Article IV and adoption of the annual report pursuant to Article III(j).</div>

  <p><BR><B>History:</B> 1976, Act 68, Imd. Eff. Apr. 5, 1976 </p>
</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><center><i>The People of the State of Michigan enact:</i></center><BR><BR><B>388.1371 Interstate agreement on qualification of educational personnel; form.</B><P>
</P>
<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The interstate agreement on qualification of educational personnel is enacted into law and entered into with all jurisdictions legally joining therein, in the form substantially as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Article 1</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Purpose, Findings and Policy</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;1.   The states party to this agreement, desiring by common action to improve their respective school systems by utilizing the teacher or other professional educational person wherever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooperation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of such persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of education, and of the teaching profession. It is the purpose of this agreement to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the states party to it, and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achieve that end.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.   The party states find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations. Variations from state to state in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other states. As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems. Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their state of origin, can increase the available educational resources. Participation in this compact can increase the availability of educational manpower.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Article 2</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Definitions</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   As used in this agreement and contracts made pursuant to it, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;1.   "Educational personnel" means persons who must meet requirements pursuant to state law as a condition of employment in educational programs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.   "Designated state official" means the education official of a state selected by that state to negotiate and enter into, on behalf of his state, contracts pursuant to this agreement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;3.   "Accept", or any variant thereof, means to recognize and give effect to 1 or more determinations of another state relating to the qualifications of educational personnel in lieu of making or requiring a like determination that would otherwise be required by or pursuant to the laws of a receiving state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;4.   "State" means a state, territory or possession of the United States: the district of columbia; or the commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;5.   "Originating state" means a state (and the subdivision thereof, if any) whose determination that certain educational personnel are qualified to be employed for specific duties in schools is acceptable in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to article 3.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;6.   "Receiving state" means a state (and the subdivisions thereof) which accept educational personnel in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to article 3.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Article 3</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Interstate Educational Personnel Contracts</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;1.   The designated state official of a party state may make 1 or more contracts on behalf of his state with 1 or more other party states providing for the acceptance of educational personnel. Any such contract for the period of its duration shall be applicable to and binding on the states whose designated state officials enter into it, and the subdivisions of those states, with the same force and effect as if incorporated in this agreement. A designated state official may enter into a contract pursuant to this article only with states in which he finds that there are programs of education, certification standards or other acceptable qualifications that assure preparation or qualification of educational personnel on a basis sufficiently comparable, even though not identical to that prevailing in his own state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.   Any such contract shall provide for:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Its duration.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The criteria to be applied by an originating state in qualifying educational personnel for acceptance by a receiving state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Such waivers, substitutions, and conditional acceptances as shall aid the practical effectuation of the contract without sacrifice of basic educational standards.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Any other necessary matters.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;3.   No contract made pursuant to this agreement shall be for a term longer than 5 years but any such contract may be renewed for like or lesser periods.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;4.   Any contract dealing with acceptance of educational personnel on the basis of their having completed an educational program shall specify the earliest date or dates on which originating state approval of the program or programs involved can have occurred. No contract made pursuant to this agreement shall require acceptance by a receiving state of any persons qualified because of successful completion of a program prior to January 1, 1954.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;5.   The certification or other acceptance of a person who has been accepted pursuant to the terms of a contract shall not be revoked or otherwise impaired because the contract has expired or been terminated. However, any certificate or other qualifying document may be revoked or suspended on any ground which would be sufficient for revocation or suspension of a certificate or other qualifying document initially granted or approved in the receiving state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;6.   A contract committee composed of the designated state officials of the contracting states or their representatives shall keep the contract under continuous review, study means of improving its administration, and report no less frequently than once a year to the heads of the appropriate education agencies of the contracting states.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Article 4</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Approved and Accepted Programs</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;1.   Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to repeal or otherwise modify any law or regulation of a party state relating to the approval of programs of educational preparation having effect solely on the qualification of educational personnel within that state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.   To the extent that contracts made pursuant to this agreement deal with the educational requirements for the proper qualification of educational personnel, acceptance of a program of educational preparation shall be in accordance with such procedures and requirements as may be provided in the applicable contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Article 5  Interstate Cooperation</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The party states agree that:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;1.   They will, so far as practicable, prefer the making of multi-lateral contracts pursuant to article 3 of this agreement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.   They will facilitate and strengthen cooperation in interstate certification and other elements of educational personnel qualification and for this purpose shall cooperate with agencies, organizations, and associations interested in certification and other elements of educational personnel qualification.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Article 6</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Agreement Evaluation</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The designated state officials of any party state may meet from time to time as a group to evaluate progress under the agreement, and to formulate recommendations for changes.  Article 7  Other Arrangements</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to prevent or inhibit other arrangements or practices of any party state or states to facilitate the interchange of educational personnel.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Article 8  Effect and Withdrawal</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;1.   This agreement shall become effective when enacted into law by 2 states. Thereafter it shall become effective as to any state upon its enactment of this agreement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.   Any party state may withdraw from this agreement by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until 1 year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;3.   No withdrawal shall relieve the withdrawing state of any obligation imposed upon it by a contract to which it is a party. The duration of contracts and the methods and conditions of withdrawal therefrom shall be those specified in their terms.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Article 9</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Construction and Severability</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   This agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States, or the application thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</DIV>

The amount of the foundation allowance for a pupil in membership is determined under section 20. In making the calculation of membership, all of the following, as applicable, apply to determining the membership of a district, a public school academy, or an intermediate district:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A pupil placed by a court or state agency in an on-grounds program of a juvenile detention facility, a child caring institution, or a mental health institution, or a pupil funded under section 53a, is counted in membership in the district or intermediate district approved by the department to operate the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A pupil enrolled in the Michigan Schools for the Deaf and Blind is counted in membership in the pupil's intermediate district of residence.</div>

Beginning July 1, 2021, this subdivision is subject to section 8c. It is the intent of the legislature that the immediately preceding sentence apply retroactively and is effective July 1, 2021. For the purposes of this subdivision, for a pupil enrolled in a cyber school, all of the following apply with regard to the participation requirement as described in this subdivision:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the pupil shall participate in each scheduled course on pupil membership count day or supplemental count day, as applicable. If the pupil is absent on pupil membership count day or supplemental count day, as applicable, the pupil must attend and participate in class during the next 10 consecutive school days if the absence was unexcused, or during the next 30 calendar days if the absence was excused.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) For a pupil who is not learning sequentially, 1 or more of the following must be met on pupil membership count day or supplemental count day, as applicable, for each scheduled course to satisfy the participation requirement under this subdivision:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(F) An alternate form of attendance as determined and agreed upon by the cyber school and the pupil membership auditor was met.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) For a pupil using sequential learning, the participation requirement under this subdivision is satisfied if either of the following occurs:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) Except as otherwise provided in this sub-subparagraph, the pupil and the teacher of record or mentor complete a 2-way interaction for 1 course during the week on which pupil membership count day or supplemental count day, as applicable, occurs, and the 3 consecutive weeks following that week. However, if a school break is scheduled during any of the weeks described in this sub-subparagraph that is 4 or more days in length or instruction has been canceled districtwide during any of the weeks described in this sub-subparagraph for 3 or more school days, the district is not required to ensure that the pupil and the teacher of record or mentor completed a 2-way interaction for that week. As used in this sub-subparagraph:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(I) "2-way interaction" means the communication that occurs between the teacher of record or mentor and pupil, where 1 party initiates communication and a response from the other party follows that communication. Responses as described in this sub-sub-subparagraph must be to the communication initiated by the teacher of record or mentor, and not some other action taken. This interaction may occur through, but is not limited to, means such as email, telephone, instant messaging, or face-to-face conversation. A parent- or legal-guardian-facilitated 2-way interaction is considered a 2-way interaction if the pupil is in any of grades K to 5 and does not yet possess the skills necessary to participate in 2-way interactions unassisted. The interactions described in this sub-sub-subparagraph must relate to a virtual course on the pupil's schedule and pertain to course content or progress.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(II) "Mentor" means a professional employee of the district who monitors the pupil's progress, ensures the pupil has access to needed technology, is available for assistance, and ensures access to the teacher of record. A mentor may also be the teacher of record if the mentor meets the definition of a teacher of record under this sub-subparagraph and the district is the provider for the course.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(III) "Teacher of record" means a teacher to whom all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The teacher is responsible for providing instruction, determining instructional methods for each pupil, diagnosing learning needs, assessing pupil learning, prescribing intervention strategies and modifying lessons, reporting outcomes, and evaluating the effects of instruction and support strategies. The teacher of record may coordinate the distribution and assignment of the responsibilities described in this sub-sub-sub-subparagraph with other teachers participating in the instructional process for a course.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The teacher is certified for the grade level or is working under a valid substitute permit, authorization, or approval issued by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The teacher has a personnel identification code provided by the center.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(IV) "Week" means a period that starts on Wednesday and ends the following Tuesday.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) The pupil completes a combination of 1 or more of the following activities for each scheduled course on pupil membership count day or supplemental count day, as applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(I) Documented attendance in a virtual course where synchronous, live instruction occurred with the teacher.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(II) Documented completion of a course assignment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(III) Documented completion of a course lesson or lesson activity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(IV) Documented pupil access to an ongoing lesson, which does not include a login.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(V) Documented physical attendance on pupil membership count day or supplemental count day, as applicable, in each scheduled course, if the pupil will attend at least 50% of the instructional time for each scheduled course on-site, face-to-face with the teacher of record. As used in this sub-sub-subparagraph, "teacher of record" means that term as defined in subparagraph (iii)(A).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) For purposes of subparagraph (iii), each scheduled course currently being attempted by the pupil, rather than every course on the pupil's schedule for the entire term, is considered a part of each scheduled course for the pupil.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) For a new district or public school academy beginning its operation after December 31, 1994, membership for the first 2 full or partial fiscal years of operation is determined as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If operations begin before the pupil membership count day for the fiscal year, membership is the average number of full-time equated pupils in grades K to 12 actually enrolled and in regular daily attendance on the pupil membership count day for the current school year and on the supplemental count day for the current school year, as determined by the department and calculated by adding the number of pupils registered for attendance on the pupil membership count day plus pupils received by transfer and minus pupils lost as defined by rules promulgated by the superintendent, and as corrected by a subsequent department audit, plus the final audited count from the supplemental count day for the current school year, and dividing that sum by 2.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If operations begin after the pupil membership count day for the fiscal year and not later than the supplemental count day for the fiscal year, membership is the final audited count of the number of full-time equated pupils in grades K to 12 actually enrolled and in regular daily attendance on the supplemental count day for the current school year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) If a district is the authorizing body for a public school academy, then, in the first school year in which pupils are counted in membership on the pupil membership count day in the public school academy, the determination of the district's membership excludes from the district's pupil count for the immediately preceding supplemental count day any pupils who are counted in the public school academy on that first pupil membership count day who were also counted in the district on the immediately preceding supplemental count day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) For an extended school year program approved by the superintendent, a pupil enrolled, but not scheduled to be in regular daily attendance, on a pupil membership count day, is counted in membership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) To be counted in membership, a pupil must meet the minimum age requirement to be eligible to attend school under section 1147 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1147, and must be less than 20 years of age on September 1 of the school year except as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A special education pupil who is enrolled and receiving instruction in a special education program or service approved by the department, who does not have a high school diploma, and who is less than 26 years of age as of September 1 of the current school year is counted in membership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A pupil who is determined by the department to meet all of the following may be counted in membership:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) Is enrolled in a public school academy or an alternative education high school diploma program, that is primarily focused on educating pupils with extreme barriers to education, such as being homeless as that term is defined under 42 USC 11302.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) Had dropped out of school.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(C) Is less than 22 years of age as of September 1 of the current school year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If a child does not meet the minimum age requirement to be eligible to attend school for that school year under section 1147 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1147, but will be 5 years of age not later than December 1 of that school year, the district may count the child in membership for that school year if the parent or legal guardian has notified the district in writing that the parent or legal guardian intends to enroll the child in kindergarten for that school year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) An individual who has achieved a high school diploma is not counted in membership. An individual who has achieved a high school equivalency certificate is not counted in membership unless the individual is a student with a disability as that term is defined in R 340.1702 of the Michigan Administrative Code. An individual participating in a job training program funded under former section 107a or a jobs program funded under former section 107b, administered by the department of labor and economic opportunity, or participating in any successor of either of those 2 programs, is not counted in membership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) If a pupil counted in membership in a public school academy is also educated by a district or intermediate district as part of a cooperative education program, the pupil is counted in membership only in the public school academy unless a written agreement signed by all parties designates the party or parties in which the pupil is counted in membership, and the instructional time scheduled for the pupil in the district or intermediate district is included in the full-time equated membership determination under subdivision (q) and section 101. However, for pupils receiving instruction in both a public school academy and in a district or intermediate district but not as a part of a cooperative education program, the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the public school academy provides instruction for at least 1/2 of the class hours required under section 101, the public school academy receives as its prorated share of the full-time equated membership for each of those pupils an amount equal to 1 times the product of the hours of instruction the public school academy provides divided by the number of hours required under section 101 for full-time equivalency, and the remainder of the full-time membership for each of those pupils is allocated to the district or intermediate district providing the remainder of the hours of instruction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the public school academy provides instruction for less than 1/2 of the class hours required under section 101, the district or intermediate district providing the remainder of the hours of instruction receives as its prorated share of the full-time equated membership for each of those pupils an amount equal to 1 times the product of the hours of instruction the district or intermediate district provides divided by the number of hours required under section 101 for full-time equivalency, and the remainder of the full-time membership for each of those pupils is allocated to the public school academy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(o) An individual less than 16 years of age as of September 1 of the current school year who is being educated in an alternative education program is not counted in membership if there are also adult education participants being educated in the same program or classroom.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(p) The department shall give a uniform interpretation of full-time and part-time memberships.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(q) The number of class hours used to calculate full-time equated memberships must be consistent with section 101. In determining full-time equated memberships for pupils who are enrolled in a postsecondary institution or for pupils engaged in an internship or work experience under section 1279h of the revised school code, MCL 380.1279h, a pupil is not considered to be less than a full-time equated pupil solely because of the effect of the pupil's postsecondary enrollment or engagement in the internship or work experience, including necessary travel time, on the number of class hours provided by the district to the pupil.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(r) Full-time equated memberships for pupils in kindergarten are determined by dividing the number of instructional hours scheduled and provided per year per kindergarten pupil by the same number used for determining full-time equated memberships for pupils in grades 1 to 12. However, to the extent allowable under federal law, for a district or public school academy that provides evidence satisfactory to the department that it used federal title I money in the 2 immediately preceding school fiscal years to fund full-time kindergarten, full-time equated memberships for pupils in kindergarten are determined by dividing the number of class hours scheduled and provided per year per kindergarten pupil by a number equal to 1/2 the number used for determining full-time equated memberships for pupils in grades 1 to 12. The change in the counting of full-time equated memberships for pupils in kindergarten that took effect for 2012-2013 is not a mandate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(s) For a district or a public school academy that has pupils enrolled in a grade level that was not offered by the district or public school academy in the immediately preceding school year, the number of pupils enrolled in that grade level to be counted in membership is the average of the number of those pupils enrolled and in regular daily attendance on the pupil membership count day and the supplemental count day of the current school year. Membership is calculated by adding the number of pupils registered for attendance in that grade level on the pupil membership count day plus pupils received by transfer and minus pupils lost as defined by rules promulgated by the superintendent, and as corrected by subsequent department audit, plus the final audited count from the supplemental count day for the current school year, and dividing that sum by 2.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(t) A pupil enrolled in a cooperative education program may be counted in membership in the pupil's district of residence with the written approval of all parties to the cooperative agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(u) If, as a result of a disciplinary action, a district determines through the district's alternative or disciplinary education program that the best instructional placement for a pupil is in the pupil's home or otherwise apart from the general school population, if that placement is authorized in writing by the district superintendent and district alternative or disciplinary education supervisor, and if the district provides appropriate instruction as described in this subdivision to the pupil at the pupil's home or otherwise apart from the general school population, the district may count the pupil in membership on a pro rata basis, with the proration based on the number of hours of instruction the district actually provides to the pupil divided by the number of hours required under section 101 for full-time equivalency. For the purposes of this subdivision, a district is considered to be providing appropriate instruction if all of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The district provides at least 2 nonconsecutive hours of instruction per week to the pupil at the pupil's home or otherwise apart from the general school population under the supervision of a certificated teacher.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The district provides instructional materials, resources, and supplies that are comparable to those otherwise provided in the district's alternative education program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Course content is comparable to that in the district's alternative education program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Credit earned is awarded to the pupil and placed on the pupil's transcript.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) If a pupil was enrolled in a public school academy on the pupil membership count day, if the public school academy's contract with its authorizing body is revoked or the public school academy otherwise ceases to operate, and if the pupil enrolls in a district within 45 days after the pupil membership count day, the department shall adjust the district's pupil count for the pupil membership count day to include the pupil in the count.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(w) For a public school academy that has been in operation for at least 2 years and that suspended operations for at least 1 semester and is resuming operations, membership is the sum of the product of .90 times the number of full-time equated pupils in grades K to 12 actually enrolled and in regular daily attendance on the first pupil membership count day or supplemental count day, whichever is first, occurring after operations resume, plus the product of .10 times the final audited count from the most recent pupil membership count day or supplemental count day that occurred before suspending operations, as determined by the superintendent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(x) If a district's membership for a particular fiscal year, as otherwise calculated under this subsection, would be less than 1,550 pupils, the district has 4.5 or fewer pupils per square mile, as determined by the department, and the district does not receive funding under section 22d(2), the district's membership is considered to be the membership figure calculated under this subdivision. If a district educates and counts in its membership pupils in grades 9 to 12 who reside in a contiguous district that does not operate grades 9 to 12 and if 1 or both of the affected districts request the department to use the determination allowed under this sentence, the department shall include the square mileage of both districts in determining the number of pupils per square mile for each of the districts for the purposes of this subdivision. If a district has established a community engagement advisory committee in partnership with the department of treasury, is required to submit a deficit elimination plan or an enhanced deficit elimination plan under section 1220 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1220, and is located in a city with a population between 9,000 and 11,000, as determined by the department, that is in a county with a population between 150,000 and 160,000, as determined by the department, the district's membership is considered to be the membership figure calculated under this subdivision. The membership figure calculated under this subdivision is the greater of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The average of the district's membership for the 3-fiscal-year period ending with that fiscal year, calculated by adding the district's actual membership for each of those 3 fiscal years, as otherwise calculated under this subsection, and dividing the sum of those 3 membership figures by 3.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The district's actual membership for that fiscal year as otherwise calculated under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(y) Full-time equated memberships for special education pupils who are not enrolled in kindergarten but are enrolled in a classroom program under R 340.1754 of the Michigan Administrative Code are determined by dividing the number of class hours scheduled and provided per year by 450. Full-time equated memberships for special education pupils who are not enrolled in kindergarten but are receiving early childhood special education services under R 340.1755 or R 340.1862 of the Michigan Administrative Code are determined by dividing the number of hours of service scheduled and provided per year per pupil by 180.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(z) A pupil of a district that begins its school year after Labor Day who is enrolled in an intermediate district program that begins before Labor Day is not considered to be less than a full-time pupil solely due to instructional time scheduled but not attended by the pupil before Labor Day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(aa) For the first year in which a pupil is counted in membership on the pupil membership count day in a middle college program, the membership is the average of the full-time equated membership on the pupil membership count day and on the supplemental count day for the current school year, as determined by the department. If a pupil described in this subdivision was counted in membership by the operating district on the immediately preceding supplemental count day, the pupil is excluded from the district's immediately preceding supplemental count for the purposes of determining the district's membership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(bb) A district or public school academy that educates a pupil who attends a United States Olympic Education Center may count the pupil in membership regardless of whether or not the pupil is a resident of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(cc) A pupil enrolled in a district other than the pupil's district of residence under section 1148(2) of the revised school code, MCL 380.1148, is counted in the educating district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(dd) For a pupil enrolled in a dropout recovery program that meets the requirements of section 23a, the pupil is counted as 1/12 of a full-time equated membership for each month that the district operating the program reports that the pupil was enrolled in the program and was in full attendance. However, if the special membership counting provisions under this subdivision and the operation of the other membership counting provisions under this subsection result in a pupil being counted as more than 1.0 FTE in a fiscal year, the payment made for the pupil under sections 22a and 22b must not be based on more than 1.0 FTE for that pupil, and any portion of an FTE for that pupil that exceeds 1.0 is instead paid under section 25g. The district operating the program shall report to the center the number of pupils who were enrolled in the program and were in full attendance for a month not later than 30 days after the end of the month. A district shall not report a pupil as being in full attendance for a month unless both of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A personalized learning plan is in place on or before the first school day of the month for the first month the pupil participates in the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Either of the following is met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) The pupil meets the district's definition under section 23a of satisfactory monthly progress for that month or, if the pupil does not meet that definition of satisfactory monthly progress for that month, the pupil did meet that definition of satisfactory monthly progress in the immediately preceding month and appropriate interventions, as defined by the district, are implemented within 10 school days after it is determined that the pupil does not meet that definition of satisfactory monthly progress.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) For the first 2 months that the pupil participates in the program, the pupil earns 0.25 credit by the end of the second month. A pupil described in this sub-subparagraph may be retroactively reported as being in full attendance for the first month that the pupil participated in the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ee) A pupil participating in a virtual course under section 21f is counted in membership in the district enrolling the pupil.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ff) If a public school academy that is not in its first or second year of operation closes at the end of a school year and does not reopen for the next school year, the department shall adjust the membership count of the district or other public school academy in which a former pupil of the closed public school academy enrolls and is in regular daily attendance for the next school year to ensure that the district or other public school academy receives the same amount of membership aid for the pupil as if the pupil were counted in the district or other public school academy on the supplemental count day of the preceding school year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(gg) If a special education pupil is expelled under section 1311 or 1311a of the revised school code, MCL 380.1311 and 380.1311a, and is not in attendance on the pupil membership count day because of the expulsion, and if the pupil remains enrolled in the district and resumes regular daily attendance during that school year, the district's membership is adjusted to count the pupil in membership as if the pupil had been in attendance on the pupil membership count day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(hh) A pupil enrolled in a community district is counted in membership in the community district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A part-time pupil enrolled in a nonpublic school in grades K to 12 in accordance with section 166b must not be counted as more than 0.75 of a full-time equated membership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(jj) A district that borders another state or a public school academy that operates at least grades 9 to 12 and is located within 20 miles of a border with another state may count in membership a pupil who is enrolled in a course at a college or university that is located in the bordering state and within 20 miles of the border with this state if all of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The pupil would meet the definition of an eligible student under the postsecondary enrollment options act, 1996 PA 160, MCL 388.511 to 388.524, if the course were an eligible course under that act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The course in which the pupil is enrolled would meet the definition of an eligible course under the postsecondary enrollment options act, 1996 PA 160, MCL 388.511 to 388.524, if the course were provided by an eligible postsecondary institution under that act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The department determines that the college or university is an institution that, in the other state, fulfills a function comparable to a state university or community college, as those terms are defined in section 3 of the postsecondary enrollment options act, 1996 PA 160, MCL 388.513, or is an independent nonprofit degree-granting college or university.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The district or public school academy pays for a portion of the pupil's tuition at the college or university in an amount equal to the eligible charges that the district or public school academy would pay to an eligible postsecondary institution under the postsecondary enrollment options act, 1996 PA 160, MCL 388.511 to 388.524, as if the course were an eligible course under that act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) The district or public school academy awards high school credit to a pupil who successfully completes a course as described in this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(kk) A pupil enrolled in a middle college program may be counted for more than a total of 1.0 full-time equated membership for any of the school years in which the pupil is enrolled in the middle college program, but the total full-time equated membership for that pupil for all of the school years in which the pupil is enrolled in high school must not be greater than 5.00 full-time equated membership if the pupil is enrolled in more than the minimum number of instructional days and hours required under section 101 and the pupil is expected to complete the 5-year program with both a high school diploma and at least 60 transferable college credits or is expected to earn an associate's degree in fewer than 5 years. A pupil who graduates with both a high school diploma and at least 60 transferable college credits or an associate degree at least 1 semester early is considered to have completed the middle college program in fewer than 5 years.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If 1 or more districts consolidate or are parties to an annexation, then the calculations under subparagraphs (i) and (ii) must be applied to the combined total membership for pupils counted in those districts for the fiscal year immediately preceding the consolidation or annexation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) "Public school academy" means that term as defined in section 5 of the revised school code, MCL 380.5.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) "Pupil" means an individual in membership in a public school. A district must have the approval of the pupil's district of residence to count the pupil in membership, except approval by the pupil's district of residence is not required for any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A nonpublic part-time pupil enrolled in grades K to 12 in accordance with section 166b.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The department shall assign a district code that includes as the first 2 digits the county code in which the authorizing body is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the cyber school does not provide instruction at a specific location, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the cyber school is authorized by an intermediate district board, the cyber school is assigned to the jurisdiction of that intermediate district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the cyber school is authorized by a district board, the cyber school is assigned to the jurisdiction of the intermediate district in which the district is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If the cyber school is authorized by the board of a community college or governing board of a state public university, the cyber school is assigned to the jurisdiction of the intermediate district in which the administrative office of the cyber school is located.  
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The intermediate district's jurisdiction to which a cyber school is assigned under this subsection remains the same for as long as that cyber school is in operation unless the cyber school experiences a change in its authorizing body.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a district or intermediate district fails to receive its proper apportionment, the department, upon satisfactory proof that the district or intermediate district was entitled justly, shall apportion the deficiency in the next apportionment. Subject to subsections (2) and (3), if a district or intermediate district has received more than its proper apportionment, the department, upon satisfactory proof, shall deduct the excess in the next apportionment. Notwithstanding any other provision in this article, state aid overpayments to a district, other than overpayments in payments for special education or special education transportation, may be recovered from any payment made under this article other than a special education or special education transportation payment, from the proceeds of a loan to the district under the emergency municipal loan act, 1980 PA 243, MCL 141.931 to 141.942, or from the proceeds of millage levied or pledged under section 1211 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1211. State aid overpayments made in special education or special education transportation payments may be recovered from subsequent special education or special education transportation payments, from the proceeds of a loan to the district under the emergency municipal loan act, 1980 PA 243, MCL 141.931 to 141.942, or from the proceeds of millage levied or pledged under section 1211 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1211.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the result of an audit conducted by or for the department affects the current fiscal year membership, the department shall adjust affected payments in the current fiscal year. A deduction due to an adjustment made as a result of an audit conducted by or for the department, or as a result of information obtained by the department from the district, an intermediate district, the department of treasury, or the office of auditor general, must be deducted from the district's apportionments when the adjustment is finalized. At the request of the district and upon the district presenting evidence satisfactory to the department of the hardship, the department may grant up to an additional 4 years for the adjustment and may advance payments to the district otherwise authorized under this article if the district would otherwise experience a significant hardship in satisfying its financial obligations. However, a district that presented satisfactory evidence of hardship and was undergoing an extended adjustment during 2018-2019 may continue to use the period of extended adjustment as originally granted by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If, based on an audit by the department or the department's designee or because of new or updated information received by the department, the department determines that the amount paid to a district or intermediate district under this article for the current fiscal year or a prior fiscal year was incorrect, the department shall make the appropriate deduction or payment in the district's or intermediate district's allocation in the next apportionment after the adjustment is finalized. The department shall calculate the deduction or payment according to the law in effect in the fiscal year in which the incorrect amount was paid. If the district does not receive an allocation for the fiscal year or if the allocation is not sufficient to pay the amount of any deduction, the amount of any deduction otherwise applicable must be satisfied from the proceeds of a loan to the district under the emergency municipal loan act, 1980 PA 243, MCL 141.931 to 141.942, or from the proceeds of millage levied or pledged under section 1211 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1211, as determined by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the department makes an adjustment under this section based in whole or in part on a membership audit finding that a district or intermediate district employed an educator in violation of certification requirements under the revised school code and rules promulgated by the department, the department shall prorate the adjustment according to the period of noncompliance with the certification requirements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The department may conduct audits, or may direct audits by designee of the department, for the current fiscal year and the immediately preceding fiscal year of all records related to a program for which a district or intermediate district has received funds under this article.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Expenditures made by the department under this article that are caused by the write-off of prior year accruals may be funded by revenue from the write-off of prior year accruals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) In addition to funds appropriated in section 11 for all programs and services, there is appropriated for 2023-2024 for obligations in excess of applicable appropriations an amount equal to the collection of overpayments, but not to exceed amounts available from overpayments.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The department may withhold all or part of any payment that a district or intermediate district is entitled to receive under this article to the extent the withholdings are a component part of a plan, developed and implemented pursuant to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821, the emergency municipal loan act, 1980 PA 243, MCL 141.931 to 141.942, the local financial stability and choice act, 2012 PA 436, MCL 141.1541 to 141.1575, section 1356 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1356, or other statutory authority, for financing an outstanding obligation upon which the district or intermediate district defaulted or for other financial obligations of the district or intermediate district. Amounts withheld shall be used to pay, on behalf of the district or intermediate district, unpaid amounts or subsequently due amounts, or both, of principal and interest on the outstanding obligation upon which the district or intermediate district defaulted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The state treasurer may withhold all or part of any payment that a district or intermediate district is entitled to receive under this article to the extent authorized or required under section 15 of the school bond qualification, approval, and loan act, 2005 PA 92, MCL 388.1935, the emergency municipal loan act, 1980 PA 243, MCL 141.931 to 141.942, the local financial stability and choice act, 2012 PA 436, MCL 141.1541 to 141.1575, section 1356 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1356, or other statutory authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Under an agreement entered into by a district or intermediate district assigning all or a portion of the payment that it is eligible to receive under this article to the Michigan finance authority or to the trustee of a pooled arrangement or pledging the amount for payment of an obligation it incurred with the Michigan finance authority or with the trustee of a pooled arrangement, the state treasurer shall transmit to the Michigan finance authority or a trustee designated by the Michigan finance authority or to the trustee of a pooled arrangement or other designated depository the amount of the payment that is assigned or pledged under the agreement. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a district or intermediate district for which an emergency manager is in place under the local financial stability and choice act, 2012 PA 436, MCL 141.1541 to 141.1575, or that has an approved deficit elimination plan or an approved enhanced deficit elimination plan under the revised school code, enters into or has entered into an agreement described in subsection (3) pursuant to section 1225(2) of the revised school code, MCL 380.1225, whether the obligation was issued before or after the effective date of this subsection, the portion of state school aid paid or to be paid on behalf of the district or intermediate district directly to the Michigan finance authority, or to a trustee designated by the Michigan finance authority, for the sole purpose of paying the principal of and interest on the obligation is subject to a lien and trust that is a statutory lien and trust, paramount and superior to all other liens and interests of any kind, for the sole purpose of paying the principal of and interest on the obligation. The statutory lien and trust applies to the state school aid received or to be received by the Michigan finance authority, or trustee designated by the Michigan finance authority, on behalf of the district or intermediate district, immediately upon the time when the state school aid is allocated to the district or intermediate district, but is subject to any subsequent reduction of the state school aid allocation by operation of law or executive order. The lien and trust imposed by this section with respect to state school aid has a priority as established in the agreement, except that the agreement shall not impair any existing lien and trust previously created pursuant to this section, including any lien and trust applicable to a multi-year repayment agreement under section 1225 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1225. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the lien and trust created under this subsection for the benefit of holders of the obligation issued pursuant to this section is valid and binding against a party having a claim of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the district or intermediate district that has issued the obligation secured by a pledge of state school aid pursuant to this section, regardless of whether that party has notice of the pledge. A pledge made pursuant to this section for the benefit of the holders of obligations or others is perfected without delivery, recording, or notice. The state school aid paid or to be paid on behalf of a district or intermediate district to the Michigan finance authority, or trustee designated by the Michigan finance authority, shall be held in trust for the sole benefit of the holders of the obligation issued pursuant to this section or section 1225 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1225, and is exempt from being levied upon, taken, sequestered, or applied toward paying the debts or liabilities of the district or intermediate district other than for payment of the obligation to which the lien applies. However, nothing in this subsection alters the ability of the state treasurer to withhold state school aid from a district or intermediate district as provided by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Notwithstanding the payment dates prescribed by this article for distributions under this article, the state treasurer may advance all or part of a payment that is dedicated for distribution or for which the appropriation authorizing the payment has been made if and to the extent, under the terms of an agreement entered into by a district or intermediate district and the Michigan finance authority, the payment that the district or intermediate district is eligible to receive has been assigned to or pledged for payment of an obligation it incurred with the Michigan finance authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) This section does not require the state to make an appropriation to any school district or intermediate school district and shall not be construed as creating an indebtedness of the state, and any agreement made pursuant to this section shall contain a statement to that effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) As used in this section, "trustee of a pooled arrangement" means the trustee of a trust approved by the state treasurer and, subject to the conditions and requirements of that approval, established for the purpose of offering for sale, as part of a pooled arrangement, certificates representing undivided interests in notes issued by districts or intermediate districts under section 1225 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1225.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a trustee applies to the state treasurer for approval of a trust for the purposes of this section, the state treasurer shall approve or disapprove the trust within 10 days after receipt of the application.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An allocation to a district or intermediate district under this article is contingent upon the district's or intermediate district's compliance with this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) All of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For 2022-2023, the target foundation allowance is $9,150.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For 2023-2024, the target foundation allowance is $9,608.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The department shall calculate the amount of each district's foundation allowance as provided in this section, using a target foundation allowance in the amount specified in subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the department shall calculate the amount of a district's foundation allowance as follows, using in all calculations the total amount of the district's foundation allowance as calculated before any proration:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For a district that had a foundation allowance for the immediately preceding fiscal year that was equal to the target foundation allowance for the immediately preceding fiscal year, the district receives a foundation allowance in an amount equal to the target foundation allowance described in subsection (1) for the current fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For a district that had a foundation allowance for the immediately preceding fiscal year that was greater than the target foundation allowance for the immediately preceding fiscal year, the district's foundation allowance is an amount equal to the lesser of (the sum of the district's foundation allowance for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus any per pupil amount calculated under section 20m(2) in the immediately preceding fiscal year plus the increase in the target foundation allowance for the current fiscal year, as compared to the immediately preceding fiscal year) or (the product of the district's foundation allowance for the immediately preceding fiscal year times the percentage increase in the United States Consumer Price Index in the calendar year ending in the immediately preceding fiscal year as reported by the May revenue estimating conference conducted under section 367b of the management and budget act, 1984 PA 431, MCL 18.1367b). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For a district that had a foundation allowance in the immediately preceding fiscal year that was less than the target foundation allowance in effect for that fiscal year, the district's foundation allowance is an amount equal to the lesser of (the sum of district's foundation allowance for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus any per pupil amount calculated under section 20m(2) in the immediately preceding fiscal year plus the increase in the target foundation allowance for the current fiscal year, as compared to the immediately preceding fiscal year) or (the product of the district's foundation allowance for the immediately preceding fiscal year times the percentage increase in the United States Consumer Price Index in the calendar year ending in the immediately preceding fiscal year as reported by the May revenue estimating conference conducted under section 367b of the management and budget act, 1984 PA 431, MCL 18.1367b).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) For a district that has a foundation allowance that is not a whole dollar amount, the department shall round the district's foundation allowance up to the nearest whole dollar.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the state portion of a district's foundation allowance is an amount equal to the district's foundation allowance or the target foundation allowance for the current fiscal year, whichever is less, minus the local portion of the district's foundation allowance. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, for a district described in subsection (3)(b) and (c), the state portion of the district's foundation allowance is an amount equal to the target foundation allowance minus the district's foundation allowance supplemental payment per pupil calculated under section 20m and minus the local portion of the district's foundation allowance. For a district that has a millage reduction required under section 31 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963, the department shall calculate the state portion of the district's foundation allowance as if that reduction did not occur. For a receiving district, if school operating taxes continue to be levied on behalf of a dissolved district that has been attached in whole or in part to the receiving district to satisfy debt obligations of the dissolved district under section 12 of the revised school code, MCL 380.12, the taxable value per membership pupil of property in the receiving district used for the purposes of this subsection does not include the taxable value of property within the geographic area of the dissolved district. For a community district, if school operating taxes continue to be levied by a qualifying school district under section 12b of the revised school code, MCL 380.12b, with the same geographic area as the community district, the taxable value per membership pupil of property in the community district to be used for the purposes of this subsection does not include the taxable value of property within the geographic area of the community district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The allocation calculated under this section for a pupil is based on the foundation allowance of the pupil's district of residence. For a pupil enrolled under section 105 or 105c in a district other than the pupil's district of residence, the allocation calculated under this section is based on the lesser of the foundation allowance of the pupil's district of residence or the foundation allowance of the educating district. For a pupil in membership in a K-5, K-6, or K-8 district who is enrolled in another district in a grade not offered by the pupil's district of residence, the allocation calculated under this section is based on the foundation allowance of the educating district if the educating district's foundation allowance is greater than the foundation allowance of the pupil's district of residence. The calculation under this subsection must take into account a district's per-pupil allocation under section 20m.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, for pupils in membership, other than special education pupils, in a public school academy, the allocation calculated under this section is an amount per membership pupil other than special education pupils in the public school academy equal to the target foundation allowance specified in subsection (1), or, for a public school academy that was issued a contract under section 552 of the revised school code, MCL 380.552, to operate as a school of excellence that is a cyber school, $9,150.00. Notwithstanding section 101, for a public school academy that begins operations after the pupil membership count day, the amount per membership pupil calculated under this subsection must be adjusted by multiplying that amount per membership pupil by the number of hours of pupil instruction provided by the public school academy after it begins operations, as determined by the department, divided by the minimum number of hours of pupil instruction required under section 101(3). The result of this calculation must not exceed the amount per membership pupil otherwise calculated under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For pupils in membership, other than special education pupils, in a community district, the allocation calculated under this section is an amount per membership pupil other than special education pupils in the community district equal to the foundation allowance of the qualifying school district, as described in section 12b of the revised school code, MCL 380.12b, that is located within the same geographic area as the community district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Subject to subsection (4), for a district that is formed or reconfigured after June 1, 2002 by consolidation of 2 or more districts or by annexation, the resulting district's foundation allowance under this section beginning after the effective date of the consolidation or annexation is the lesser of the sum of the average of the foundation allowances of each of the original or affected districts, calculated as provided in this section, weighted as to the percentage of pupils in total membership in the resulting district who reside in the geographic area of each of the original or affected districts plus $100.00 or the highest foundation allowance among the original or affected districts. This subsection does not apply to a receiving district unless there is a subsequent consolidation or annexation that affects the district. The calculation under this subsection must take into account a district's per-pupil allocation under section 20m.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The department shall round each fraction used in making calculations under this section to the fourth decimal place and shall round the dollar amount of an increase in the target foundation allowance to the nearest whole dollar.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) For 2022-2023, state payments related to payment of the foundation allowance for a special education pupil are not calculated under this section but are instead calculated as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Twenty-five percent is calculated under section 51a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Seventy-five percent is calculated under section 51e.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) For 2023-2024, state payments related to payment of the foundation allowance for a special education pupil are not calculated under this section but are instead calculated under section 51e. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) To assist the legislature in determining the target foundation allowance for the subsequent fiscal year, each revenue estimating conference conducted under section 367b of the management and budget act, 1984 PA 431, MCL 18.1367b, must calculate a pupil membership factor, a revenue adjustment factor, and an index as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The pupil membership factor is computed by dividing the estimated membership in the school year ending in the current fiscal year, excluding intermediate district membership, by the estimated membership for the school year ending in the subsequent fiscal year, excluding intermediate district membership. If a consensus membership factor is not determined at the revenue estimating conference, the principals of the revenue estimating conference shall report their estimates to the house and senate subcommittees responsible for school aid appropriations not later than 7 days after the conclusion of the revenue conference.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The revenue adjustment factor is computed by dividing the sum of the estimated total state school aid fund revenue for the subsequent fiscal year plus the estimated total state school aid fund revenue for the current fiscal year, adjusted for any change in the rate or base of a tax the proceeds of which are deposited in that fund and excluding money transferred into that fund from the countercyclical budget and economic stabilization fund under the management and budget act, 1984 PA 431, MCL 18.1101 to 18.1594, by the sum of the estimated total school aid fund revenue for the current fiscal year plus the estimated total state school aid fund revenue for the immediately preceding fiscal year, adjusted for any change in the rate or base of a tax the proceeds of which are deposited in that fund. If a consensus revenue factor is not determined at the revenue estimating conference, the principals of the revenue estimating conference shall report their estimates to the house and senate subcommittees responsible for school aid appropriations not later than 7 days after the conclusion of the revenue conference.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The index is calculated by multiplying the pupil membership factor by the revenue adjustment factor. If a consensus index is not determined at the revenue estimating conference, the principals of the revenue estimating conference shall report their estimates to the house and senate subcommittees responsible for state school aid appropriations not later than 7 days after the conclusion of the revenue conference.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Payments to districts and public school academies are not made under this section. Rather, the calculations under this section are used to determine the amount of state payments under section 22b.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) If an amendment to section 2 of article VIII of the state constitution of 1963 allowing state aid to some or all nonpublic schools is approved by the voters of this state, each foundation allowance or per-pupil payment calculation under this section may be reduced.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Certified mills" means the lesser of 18 mills or the number of mills of school operating taxes levied by the district in 1993-94.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Current fiscal year" means the fiscal year for which a particular calculation is made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Dissolved district" means a district that loses its organization, has its territory attached to 1 or more other districts, and is dissolved as provided under section 12 of the revised school code, MCL 380.12.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Immediately preceding fiscal year" means the fiscal year immediately preceding the current fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) "Local portion of the district's foundation allowance" means an amount that is equal to the difference between (the sum of the product of the taxable value per membership pupil of all property in the district that is nonexempt property times the district's certified mills and, for a district with certified mills exceeding 12, the product of the taxable value per membership pupil of property in the district that is commercial personal property times the certified mills minus 12 mills) and (the quotient of the product of the captured assessed valuation under tax increment financing acts times the district's certified mills divided by the district's membership excluding special education pupils).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) "Membership" means the definition of that term under section 6 as in effect for the particular fiscal year for which a particular calculation is made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) "Nonexempt property" means property that is not a principal residence, qualified agricultural property, qualified forest property, supportive housing property, industrial personal property, commercial personal property, or property occupied by a public school academy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) "Principal residence", "qualified agricultural property", "qualified forest property", "supportive housing property", "industrial personal property", and "commercial personal property" mean those terms as defined in section 1211 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1211.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) "Receiving district" means a district to which all or part of the territory of a dissolved district is attached under section 12 of the revised school code, MCL 380.12.</div>

It is the intent of the legislature that an amount not to exceed $18,000,000.00 is used in 2023-2024, an amount not to exceed $9,000,000.00 is used in 2024-2025, and $0.00 is used in 2025-2026.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The funding under this subsection is from the allocation under subsection (1). A district is eligible for funding under this subsection if the district received a payment under this section as it was in effect for 2013-2014. A district was eligible for funding in 2013-2014 if the sum of the following was less than $5.00:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The increase in the district's foundation allowance or per-pupil payment as calculated under section 20 from 2012-2013 to 2013-2014.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) It is the intent of the legislature that a district's allocation under subsection (4) for 2024-2025 is half of the allocation as otherwise calculated. The amount allocated to each eligible district under subsection (4) is an amount per membership pupil equal to $25.00 minus the sum of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The increase in the district's foundation allowance or per-pupil payment as calculated under section 20 from 2014-2015 to 2015-2016.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The decrease in the district's best practices per-pupil funding under former section 22f from 2014-2015 to 2015-2016.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The decrease in the district's pupil performance per-pupil funding under former section 22j from 2014-2015 to 2015-2016.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The quotient of the district's allocation under section 31a for 2015-2016 divided by the district's membership pupils for 2015-2016 minus the quotient of the district's allocation under section 31a for 2014-2015 divided by the district's membership pupils for 2014-2015.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the allocation under subsection (1) is insufficient to fully fund payments under subsections (3) and (5) as otherwise calculated under this section, the department shall prorate payments under this section on an equal per-pupil basis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The funds allocated under this section for 2023-2024 are a work project appropriation, and any unexpended funds for 2023-2024 are carried forward into 2024-2025. The purpose of the work project is to continue payments to districts eligible for funding under this section. The estimated completion date of the work project described in this subsection is September 30, 2025.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Foundation allowance supplemental payments for the current fiscal year to qualifying districts with an adjustment to their foundation allowance from fiscal year 2020-2021 to the current fiscal year that is less than the adjustment in the target foundation allowance from fiscal year 2020-2021 to the current fiscal year must be calculated under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The per-pupil allocation to each qualifying district under this section is the difference between the dollar amount of the adjustment from fiscal year 2020-2021 to the current fiscal year in the target foundation allowance minus the dollar amount of the adjustment from fiscal year 2020-2021 to the current fiscal year in a qualifying district's foundation allowance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a district's local revenue per pupil does not exceed the sum of its foundation allowance under section 20 plus the per-pupil allocation under subsection (2), the total payment to the district calculated under this section is the product of the per-pupil allocation under subsection (2) multiplied by the district's membership, excluding special education pupils. If a district's local revenue per pupil exceeds its foundation allowance under section 20 but does not exceed the sum of its foundation allowance under section 20 plus the per-pupil allocation under subsection (2), the total payment to the district calculated under this section is the product of the difference between the sum of its foundation allowance under section 20 plus the per-pupil allocation under subsection (2) minus the local revenue per pupil multiplied by the district's membership, excluding special education pupils. If a district's local revenue per pupil exceeds the sum of its foundation allowance under section 20 plus the per-pupil allocation under subsection (2), there is no payment calculated under this section for the district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Payments to districts must not be made under this section. Rather, the calculations under this section are used to determine the amount of state payments that are made under section 22b.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) As used in this section, "qualifying district" means a district where the millage limitation in section 1211(3) of the revised school code, MCL 380.1211, is applied due to the increase in the target foundation allowance from the immediately preceding fiscal year to the current fiscal year exceeding the percentage increase in the general price level in the immediately preceding calendar year applied to the district's immediately preceding fiscal year foundation allowance. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A primary district shall enroll an eligible pupil in virtual courses in accordance with the provisions of this section. A primary district shall not offer a virtual course to an eligible pupil unless the virtual course is published in the primary district's catalog of board-approved courses or in the statewide catalog of virtual courses maintained by the Michigan Virtual University pursuant to section 98. The primary district shall also provide on its publicly accessible website a link to the statewide catalog of virtual courses maintained by the Michigan Virtual University. Unless the pupil is at least age 18 or is an emancipated minor, a pupil must not be enrolled in a course that meets virtually for more than 15 days in a school year without the consent of the pupil's parent or legal guardian.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to subsection (3), a primary district shall enroll an eligible pupil in up to 2 virtual courses as requested by the pupil during an academic term, semester, or trimester.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A pupil may be enrolled in more than 2 virtual courses in a specific academic term, semester, or trimester if both of the following conditions are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The primary district has determined that it is in the best interest of the pupil.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The pupil agrees with the recommendation of the primary district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the number of applicants eligible for acceptance in a virtual course does not exceed the capacity of the provider to provide the virtual course, the provider shall accept for enrollment all of the applicants eligible for acceptance. If the number of applicants exceeds the provider's capacity to provide the virtual course, the provider shall use a random draw system, subject to the need to abide by state and federal antidiscrimination laws and court orders. A primary district that is also a provider shall determine whether or not it has the capacity to accept applications for enrollment from nonresident applicants in virtual courses and may use that limit as the reason for refusal to enroll a nonresident applicant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A primary district may not establish additional requirements beyond those specified in this subsection that would prohibit a pupil from taking a virtual course. A pupil's primary district may deny the pupil enrollment in a virtual course if any of the following apply, as determined by the district:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The pupil is enrolled in any of grades K to 5.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The pupil has previously gained the credits that would be provided from the completion of the virtual course.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The virtual course is not capable of generating academic credit.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The pupil has not completed the prerequisite coursework for the requested virtual course or has not demonstrated proficiency in the prerequisite course content.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The pupil has failed a previous virtual course in the same subject during the 2 most recent academic years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The virtual course is of insufficient quality or rigor. A primary district that denies a pupil enrollment request for this reason shall enroll the pupil in a virtual course in the same or a similar subject that the primary district determines is of acceptable rigor and quality.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The cost of the virtual course exceeds the amount identified in subsection (10), unless the pupil or the pupil's parent or legal guardian agrees to pay the cost that exceeds this amount.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The request for a virtual course enrollment did not occur within the same timelines established by the primary district for enrollment and schedule changes for regular courses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) The request for a virtual course enrollment was not made in the academic term, semester, trimester, or summer preceding the enrollment. This subdivision does not apply to a request made by a pupil who is newly enrolled in the primary district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a pupil is denied enrollment in a virtual course by the pupil's primary district, the primary district shall provide written notification to the pupil of the denial, the reason or reasons for the denial under subsection (5), and a description of the appeal process. The pupil may appeal the denial by submitting a letter to the superintendent of the intermediate district in which the pupil's primary district is located. The letter of appeal must include the reason provided by the primary district for not enrolling the pupil and the reason why the pupil is claiming that the enrollment should be approved. The intermediate district superintendent or designee shall respond to the appeal within 5 days after it is received. If the intermediate district superintendent or designee determines that the denial of enrollment does not meet 1 or more of the reasons specified in subsection (5), the primary district shall enroll the pupil in the virtual course.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Ensure that the virtual course has been published in the pupil's primary district's catalog of board-approved courses or published in the statewide catalog of virtual courses maintained by the Michigan Virtual University.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Assign to each pupil a teacher of record and provide the primary district with the personnel identification code assigned by the center for the teacher of record. If the provider is a community college, the virtual course must be taught by an instructor employed by or contracted through the providing community college.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Offer the virtual course on an open entry and exit method, or aligned to a semester, trimester, or accelerated academic term format.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If the virtual course is offered to eligible pupils in more than 1 district, the following additional requirements must also be met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Provide the Michigan Virtual University with a course syllabus that meets the definition under subsection (14)(g) in a form and manner prescribed by the Michigan Virtual University for inclusion in a statewide catalog of virtual courses.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) To provide a virtual course under this section, a community college shall ensure that each virtual course it provides under this section generates postsecondary credit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) For any virtual course a pupil enrolls in under this section, the pupil's primary district must assign to the pupil a mentor and shall supply the provider with the mentor's contact information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) For a pupil enrolled in 1 or more virtual courses, the primary district shall use foundation allowance or per-pupil funds calculated under section 20 to pay for the expenses associated with the virtual course or courses. A primary district is not required to pay toward the cost of a virtual course an amount that exceeds 6.67% of the target foundation allowance for the current fiscal year as calculated under section 20.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A virtual learning pupil has the same rights and access to technology in the pupil's primary district's school facilities as all other pupils enrolled in the pupil's primary district. The department shall establish standards for hardware, software, and internet access for pupils who are enrolled in more than 2 virtual courses under this section in an academic term, semester, or trimester taken at a location other than a school facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If a pupil successfully completes a virtual course, as determined by the pupil's primary district, the pupil's primary district shall grant appropriate academic credit for completion of the course and shall count that credit toward completion of graduation and subject area requirements. A pupil's school record and transcript must identify the virtual course title as it appears in the virtual course syllabus.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The enrollment of a pupil in 1 or more virtual courses must not result in a pupil being counted as more than 1.0 full-time equivalent pupils under this article. The minimum requirements to count the pupil in membership are those established by the pupil accounting manual as it was in effect for the 2015-2016 school year or as subsequently amended by the department if the department notifies the legislature about the proposed amendment at least 60 days before the amendment becomes effective.</div>

Funds allocated under this section that are not expended in the fiscal year for which they were allocated, as determined by the department, may be used to supplement the allocations under sections 22b and 51c to fully fund those allocations for the same fiscal year. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) To ensure that a district receives an amount equal to the district's 1994-95 total state and local per-pupil revenue for school operating purposes, there is allocated to each district a state portion of the district's 1994-95 foundation allowance in an amount calculated as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the state portion of a district's 1994-95 foundation allowance is an amount equal to the district's 1994-95 foundation allowance or $6,500.00, whichever is less, minus the difference between the sum of the product of the taxable value per membership pupil of all property in the district that is nonexempt property times the district's certified mills and, for a district with certified mills exceeding 12, the product of the taxable value per membership pupil of property in the district that is commercial personal property times the certified mills minus 12 mills and the quotient of the ad valorem property tax revenue of the district captured under tax increment financing acts divided by the district's membership. For a district that has a millage reduction required under section 31 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963, the department shall calculate the state portion of the district's foundation allowance as if that reduction did not occur. For a receiving district, if school operating taxes are to be levied on behalf of a dissolved district that has been attached in whole or in part to the receiving district to satisfy debt obligations of the dissolved district under section 12 of the revised school code, MCL 380.12, taxable value per membership pupil of all property in the receiving district that is nonexempt property and taxable value per membership pupil of property in the receiving district that is commercial personal property do not include property within the geographic area of the dissolved district; ad valorem property tax revenue of the receiving district captured under tax increment financing acts does not include ad valorem property tax revenue captured within the geographic boundaries of the dissolved district under tax increment financing acts; and certified mills do not include the certified mills of the dissolved district. For a community district, the department shall reduce the allocation as otherwise calculated under this section by an amount equal to the amount of local school operating tax revenue that would otherwise be due to the community district if not for the operation of section 386 of the revised school code, MCL 380.386, and the amount of this reduction is offset by the increase in funding under section 22b(2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For a district that had a 1994-95 foundation allowance greater than $6,500.00, the state payment under this subsection is the sum of the amount calculated under subdivision (a) plus the amount calculated under this subdivision. The amount calculated under this subdivision must be equal to the difference between the district's 1994-95 foundation allowance minus $6,500.00 and the current year hold harmless school operating taxes per pupil. If the result of the calculation under subdivision (a) is negative, the negative amount is an offset against any state payment calculated under this subdivision. If the result of a calculation under this subdivision is negative, there is not a state payment or a deduction under this subdivision. The taxable values per membership pupil used in the calculations under this subdivision are as adjusted by ad valorem property tax revenue captured under tax increment financing acts divided by the district's membership. For a receiving district, if school operating taxes are to be levied on behalf of a dissolved district that has been attached in whole or in part to the receiving district to satisfy debt obligations of the dissolved district under section 12 of the revised school code, MCL 380.12, ad valorem property tax revenue captured under tax increment financing acts do not include ad valorem property tax revenue captured within the geographic boundaries of the dissolved district under tax increment financing acts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For pupils in membership in a qualifying public school academy, there is allocated under this section to the authorizing body that is the fiscal agent for the qualifying public school academy for forwarding to the qualifying public school academy an amount equal to the 1994-95 per-pupil payment to the qualifying public school academy under section 20.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A district or qualifying public school academy may use funds allocated under this section in conjunction with any federal funds for which the district or qualifying public school academy otherwise would be eligible.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, for a district that is formed or reconfigured after June 1, 2000 by consolidation of 2 or more districts or by annexation, the resulting district's 1994-95 foundation allowance under this section beginning after the effective date of the consolidation or annexation is the average of the 1994-95 foundation allowances of each of the original or affected districts, calculated as provided in this section, weighted as to the percentage of pupils in total membership in the resulting district in the fiscal year in which the consolidation takes place who reside in the geographic area of each of the original districts. If an affected district's 1994-95 foundation allowance is less than the 1994-95 basic foundation allowance, the amount of that district's 1994-95 foundation allowance is considered for the purpose of calculations under this subsection to be equal to the amount of the 1994-95 basic foundation allowance. This subsection does not apply to a receiving district unless there is a subsequent consolidation or annexation that affects the district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Payments under this section are subject to section 25g.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If payments resulting from a final determination by the local claims review board or a court of competent jurisdiction that there has been a violation of section 29 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 exceed the amount allocated for discretionary nonmandated payments under this section, the legislature shall provide for adequate funding for this state's constitutional obligations at its next legislative session.</div>

An advocate or teacher of record may be employed by the district or may be provided by an education management organization that is partnering with the district. Before an individual is assigned to be an advocate or teacher of record for a pupil in the dropout recovery program, the district must comply with sections 1230 and 1230a of the revised school code, MCL 380.1230 and 380.1230a, with respect to that individual.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Is operated throughout the entire calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the district partners with an education management organization for the program, the education management organization has a dropout recovery program partnership relationship with at least 1 other district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A district operating a dropout recovery program under this section shall adopt a definition of satisfactory monthly progress that is consistent with the definition of that term under subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Advocate" means an adult available to meet in person with assigned pupils, as needed, to conduct social interventions, to proctor final examinations, and to provide academic and social support to pupils enrolled in the district's dropout recovery program.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Satisfactory monthly progress" means an amount of progress that is measurable on a monthly basis and that, if continued for a full 12 months, would result in the same amount of academic credit being awarded to the pupil as would be awarded to a general education pupil completing a full school year. Satisfactory monthly progress may include a lesser required amount of progress for the first 2 months a pupil participates in the program, but must include at least a total of 0.25 earned academic credit by the end of that 2-month period.</div>

It assumes the invalid creation of a continuing appropriation. Therefore, the following sections of the school aid act and their associated allocations must be considered inoperative: 24, 55, 74, 75, 105a, 111, and 116. These sections will be treated as excluded from the current bill... .”In subsection (2), as amended by Act 297 of 2000, the last sentence “In addition, a district or intermediate district that received funds under this subsection for 1998-99 for an on-grounds educational program that is longer than 181 days but not longer than 233 days shall continue to receive funds under this section for subsequent fiscal years for that program” was vetoed by the governor July 26, 2000.In the first and second sentences of subsection (1), as amended by Act 121 of 2001, the phrases “and for 2002-2003” and “and $8,900,000.00 for 2002-2003” were vetoed by the governor September 28, 2001.Enacting section 3 of Act 521 of 2002 provides:“Enacting section 3. This amendatory act does not take effect unless the tax on cigarettes under the tobacco products tax act, 1993 PA 327, MCL 205.421 to 205.436, is increased by 50 cents or more per pack of cigarettes (25 mills per cigarette) effective on or before September 30, 2002 and the revenue from not less than 20 cents per pack of cigarettes (10 mills per cigarette) of that increase is dedicated by law for deposit into the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963.”For legislation increasing tax on cigarettes and dedicating a portion of increased revenue to state school aid fund, see 2002 PA 503, Imd.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The pupil membership transfer application and pupil transfer process administered by the center under this section is used for processing pupil transfers. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a pupil counted in membership for the pupil membership count day transfers from a district or intermediate district to enroll in another district or intermediate district after the pupil membership count day and before the supplemental count day and, due to the pupil's enrollment and attendance status as of the pupil membership count day, the pupil was not counted in membership in the educating district or intermediate district, the educating district or intermediate district may report the enrollment and attendance information to the center through the pupil transfer process within 30 days after the transfer or within 30 days after the pupil membership count certification date, whichever is later. Pupil transfers may be submitted no earlier than the first day after the certification deadline for the pupil membership count day and before the supplemental count day. Upon receipt of the transfer information under this subsection indicating that a pupil has enrolled and is in attendance in an educating district or intermediate district as described in this subsection, the center shall do the following: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Notify the district in which the pupil was previously enrolled. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Notify both the pupil auditing staff of the intermediate district in which the educating district is located and the pupil auditing staff of the intermediate district in which the district that previously enrolled the pupil is located. The pupil auditing staff shall investigate a representative sample based on required audit sample sizes in the pupil auditing manual and may deny the pupil membership transfer.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Adjust the membership calculation for each district or intermediate district in which the pupil was previously counted in membership or that previously received an adjustment in its membership calculation under this section due to a change in the pupil's enrollment and attendance so that the district's or intermediate district's membership is prorated to allow the district or intermediate district to receive for each school day, as determined by the financial calendar furnished by the center, in which the pupil was enrolled and in attendance in the district or intermediate district an amount equal to 1/105 of a full-time equated membership claimed in the fall pupil membership count. The department shall pay the district or intermediate district a prorated foundation allowance in an amount equal to the product of the adjustment under this subdivision for the district or intermediate district multiplied by the foundation allowance or per-pupil payment as calculated under section 20 for the district or intermediate district. The foundation allowance or per-pupil payment is adjusted by the pupil's full-time equated status as affected by the membership definition under section 6(4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Adjust the membership calculation for the educating district or intermediate district in which the pupil is enrolled and is in attendance so that the district's or intermediate district's membership is increased to allow the district or intermediate district to receive an amount equal to the difference between the full-time equated membership claimed in the fall pupil membership count and the sum of the adjustments calculated under subdivision (a) for each district or intermediate district in which the pupil was previously enrolled and in attendance. The department shall pay the educating district or intermediate district a prorated foundation allowance in an amount equal to the product of the adjustment under this subdivision for the educating district or intermediate district multiplied by the per-pupil payment as calculated under section 20 for the educating district or intermediate district. The foundation allowance or per-pupil payment is adjusted by the pupil's full-time equated status as affected by the membership definition under section 6(4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The changes in calculation of state school aid required under subsection (3) take effect as of the date that the pupil becomes enrolled and in attendance in the educating district or intermediate district, and the department shall base all subsequent payments under this article for the fiscal year to the affected districts or intermediate districts on this recalculation of state school aid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a pupil enrolls in an educating district or intermediate district as described in subsection (2), the district or intermediate district in which the pupil is counted in membership or another educating district or intermediate district that received an adjustment in its membership calculation under subsection (3), if any, and the educating district or intermediate district shall provide to the center and the department all information they require to comply with this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The portion of the full-time equated pupil membership for which a pupil is enrolled in 1 or more online courses under section 21f that is representative of the amount that the primary district paid in course costs to the course provider is not counted or transferred under the pupil transfer process under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The center annually shall provide a report to the senate and house appropriations subcommittees on state school aid, and to the senate and house fiscal agencies, detailing the number of pupils transferring in from outside the public school system of this state and the number of pupils transferring out of the public school system in this state between the pupil membership count day and supplemental count day as described in this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this section: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Educating district or intermediate district" means the district or intermediate district in which a pupil enrolls after the pupil membership count day or after an adjustment was made in another district's or intermediate district's membership calculation under this section due to the pupil's enrollment and attendance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Pupil" means that term as defined under section 6 and also children receiving early childhood special education programs and services.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the district or public school academy began operations as a district or public school academy after the pupil membership count day of the immediately preceding school year, the number of membership pupils in the district or public school academy who are determined to be economically disadvantaged, as reported to the center in the form and manner prescribed by the center not later than the fifth Wednesday after the pupil membership count day of the current fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the district or public school academy began operations as a district or public school academy after the pupil membership count day of the current fiscal year, the number of membership pupils in the district or public school academy who are determined to be economically disadvantaged, as reported to the center in the form and manner prescribed by the center not later than the fifth Wednesday after the supplemental count day of the current fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If, for a particular fiscal year, the number of membership pupils in a district or public school academy who are determined under subdivision (a) to be economically disadvantaged or to be eligible based on the identified student percentage varies by more than 20 percentage points from the number of those pupils in the district or public school academy as calculated under subdivision (a) for the immediately preceding fiscal year caused by an egregious reporting error by the district or public school academy, the department may choose to have the calculations under subdivision (a) instead be made using the number of membership pupils in the district or public school academy who are determined to be economically disadvantaged, as reported to the center in the form and manner prescribed by the center not later than the fifth Wednesday after the supplemental count day of the immediately preceding fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Each district or public school academy must be assigned to an opportunity index score each fiscal year, the value of which is the quotient of the number of economically disadvantaged pupils as determined under subsection (3) for the district or public school academy and the total number of pupils in the district or public school academy in the immediately preceding fiscal year, multiplied by 100 and rounded up to the nearest whole number. Each district or public school academy must be assigned an opportunity index band as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A district or public school academy with an opportunity index score greater than or equal to 0 but less than 20 must be assigned to band 1 and shall receive reimbursement under subsection (3) at a rate of at least 35.0% and less than 36.0%. The reimbursement rate under this subdivision must be an amount equal to the district's opportunity index score minus 1, multiplied by the band adjustment factor applicable to this subdivision, plus 35.0%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A district or public school academy with an opportunity index score greater than or equal to 20 but less than 44 must be assigned to band 2 and shall receive reimbursement under subsection (3) at a rate of at least 36.0% and less than 37.5%.

The reimbursement rate under this subdivision must be an amount equal to the district's opportunity index score minus 44, multiplied by the band adjustment factor applicable to this subdivision, plus 37.5%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A district or public school academy with an opportunity index score greater than or equal to 59 but less than 73 must be assigned to band 4 and shall receive reimbursement under subsection (3) at a rate of at least 39.0% and less than 42.0%. The reimbursement rate under this subdivision must be an amount equal to the district's opportunity index score minus 59, multiplied by the band adjustment factor applicable to this subdivision, plus 39.0%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A district or public school academy with an opportunity index score greater than or equal to 73 but less than 85 must be assigned to band 5 and shall receive reimbursement under subsection (3) at a rate of at least 42.0% and less than 47.0%.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A district or public school academy with an opportunity index score greater than or equal to 85 must be assigned to band 6 and shall receive reimbursement under subsection (3) at a rate of 47.0%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) As used in this subsection, "band adjustment factor" means an amount equal to the difference between the lowest and highest reimbursement bounds for each band, divided by the number of possible opportunity index scores in that band.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a district or public school academy receiving funding under this section shall use that money only to provide instructional programs and direct noninstructional services, including, but not limited to, medical, mental health, or counseling services, for at-risk pupils; for school health clinics; and for the purposes of subsection (6), (7), (8), (19), or (20). In addition, a district that is a school district of the first class or a district or public school academy in which at least 50% of the pupils in membership were determined to be economically disadvantaged in the immediately preceding state fiscal year, as determined and reported as described in subsection (3), may use the funds it receives under this section for school security or school parent liaison personnel.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) From the state school aid fund money appropriated in section 11, there is allocated for 2023-2024 for the purposes of this section an amount not to exceed $106,545,000.00 and from the general fund money appropriated in section 11, there is allocated for 2023-2024 for the purposes of this section an amount not to exceed $1,300,000.00. The department and the department of health and human services shall continue a program to distribute this funding to add licensed behavioral health providers for general education pupils, and recipients of the funds under subsection (6) shall continue to seek federal Medicaid match funding for all eligible mental health and support services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The department and the department of health and human services shall maintain an advisory council for programs funded under this section and any other funding under this act to improve or maintain the mental health of students, except for programs funded under section 31a(7) and (8).

At a minimum, the advisory council shall consist of representatives of state associations representing school health, school mental health, school counseling, education, health care, and other organizations, representatives from the department and the department of health and human services, and a representative from the school safety and mental health commission. The department and department of health and human services, working with the advisory council, shall determine an approach to increase capacity for mental health and support services in schools for general education pupils, and shall determine where that increase in capacity qualifies for federal Medicaid match funding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The advisory council shall develop a fiduciary agent checklist for intermediate districts to facilitate development of a plan to submit to the department and to the department of health and human services. The department and department of health and human services shall determine the requirements and format for intermediate districts to submit a plan for possible funding under subsection (6). The department shall make applications for funding for this program available to districts and intermediate districts not later than December 1 of each fiscal year for which funds are allocated under this section and shall award the funding not later than February 1 of each fiscal year for which funds are allocated under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The department of health and human services shall amend the state Medicaid plan to obtain appropriate Medicaid waivers as necessary for the purpose of generating additional Medicaid match funding for school mental health and support services for general education pupils, and this expansion is called Caring for Students (C4S).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) From the state school aid fund money allocated under subsection (1), there is allocated for 2023-2024 an amount not to exceed $14,300,000.00 to be distributed to the network of child and adolescent health centers to place a licensed master's level behavioral health provider in schools that do not currently have services available to general education students. Child and adolescent health centers that are part of the network described in this subsection shall provide a commitment to maintain services and implement all available federal Medicaid match methodologies. The department of health and human services shall use all existing or additional federal Medicaid match opportunities to maximize funding allocated under this subsection. The department shall provide funds under this subsection to child and adolescent health centers that are part of the network described in this subsection in the same proportion that funding under section 31a(7) is provided to child and adolescent health centers that are part of the network described in this subsection and that are located and operating in those districts.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) From the state school aid fund money allocated under subsection (1), there is allocated for 2023-2024 an amount not to exceed $87,245,000.00 to be distributed to intermediate districts for the provision of mental health and support services to general education students.

If a district or intermediate district is not able to procure the services of a licensed master's level behavioral health provider, the district or intermediate district shall notify the department and the department of health and human services and, if the department and department of health and human services verify that the district or intermediate district attempted to procure services from a master's level behavioral health provider and was not able to do so, then the district or intermediate district may instead procure services from a provider with less than a master's degree in behavioral health. To be able to use the exemption in the immediately preceding sentence, the district or intermediate district must submit evidence satisfactory to the department and department of health and human services demonstrating that the district or intermediate district took measures to procure the services of a licensed master's level behavioral health provider but was unable to do so, and the department and department of health and human services must be able to verify this evidence. From the first $56,173,600.00 of the funds allocated under this subsection, the department shall distribute up to $1,003,100.00 for 2023-2024 to each intermediate district that submits a plan approved by the department and the department of health and human services by February 1 of each fiscal year for which funds are allocated under this section. The department shall distribute the remaining $31,071,400.00 of the funds allocated under this subsection for 2023-2024 to intermediate districts on an equal per-pupil basis based on the combined total number of pupils in membership in the intermediate district and its constituent districts, including public school academies that are considered to be constituent districts under section 705(7) of the revised school code, MCL 380.705. The department and department of health and human services shall work cooperatively in providing oversight and assistance to intermediate districts and shall monitor the program upon implementation. An intermediate district shall use funds awarded under this subsection to provide funding to its constituent districts, including public school academies that are considered to be constituent districts under section 705(7) of the revised school code, MCL 380.705, for the provision of mental health and support services to general education students.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If funding awarded to an intermediate district remains after funds are provided by the intermediate district to its constituent districts, the intermediate district shall notify the department and department of health and human services and submit evidence satisfactory to the department and department of health and human services demonstrating how it would like to use funds for purposes other than hiring licensed behavioral health providers for general education pupils. With permission from the department and department of health and human services, the intermediate district may hire or contract for experts to provide mental health and support services to general education students residing within the boundaries of the intermediate district, including, but not limited to, expanding, hiring, or contracting for staff and experts to provide those services directly or to increase access to those services through coordination with outside mental health agencies; the intermediate district may also contract with 1 or more other intermediate districts for coordination and the facilitation of activities related to providing mental health and support services to general education students residing within the boundaries of the intermediate district; the intermediate district may also use the funds under this section to create or strengthen school-based behavioral health assessment teams that focus on providing age-appropriate interventions, identifying behaviors that suggest a pupil may be struggling with mental health challenges, providing treatment and support of the pupil, and using disciplinary interventions and the criminal justice system as methods of last resort; and the intermediate district may also use the funds under this section to provide evidence-based trainings that support student mental health.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If funding awarded to an intermediate district under this section remains unspent, or if the intermediate district submits an application requesting a lower allocation than the maximum amount permitted, the department, in conjunction with the intermediate district, may reallocate the funds to another intermediate district or other intermediate districts capable of expending the funds before the funding deadline in accordance with this section as if those funds were originally allocated to the intermediate district or intermediate districts to which the funds are being reallocated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A district requesting funds under this section from the intermediate district in which it is located shall submit an application for funding for the provision of mental health and support services to general education pupils. A district receiving funding from the application process described in this subsection shall provide services to nonpublic students upon request. An intermediate district shall not discriminate against an application submitted by a public school academy simply on the basis of the applicant being a public school academy. The department shall approve grant applications based on the following criteria:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The district's commitment to maintain mental health and support services delivered by licensed providers into future fiscal years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The district's commitment to work with its intermediate district to use funding it receives under this section that is spent by the district for general education pupils toward participation in federal Medicaid match methodologies. A district must provide a local match of at least 20% of the funding allocated to the district under section 31n.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The district's commitment to adhere to any local funding requirements determined by the department and the department of health and human services.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The district's submission of a formal plan of action identifying the number of schools and students to be served.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Whether the district will participate in ongoing trainings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Whether the district will submit an annual report to the state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Whether the district demonstrates a willingness to work with the state to establish program and service delivery benchmarks.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) Any other requirements determined by the department or the department of health and human services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Funding under this section, including any federal Medicaid funds that are generated, must not be used to supplant existing services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Both of the following are allocated to the department of health and human services from the general fund money allocated under subsection (1):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For 2023-2024, an amount not to exceed $1,000,000.00 for the purpose of upgrading technology and systems infrastructure and other administrative requirements to support the programs funded under this section.</div>

The platform should use existing password-protected access control methods schools currently utilize and, to the extent possible, be capable of integrating with existing platforms or technologies used by districts for school safety. Through permissions-based access control, the platform should be able to relay information clearly and in real time to each person or entity necessary to provide a unified response to a safety incident, or to take appropriate action in response to an anticipated disruption to the normal functions of the surrounding community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) From the state school aid fund money allocated in subsection (1), the department shall make payments to districts and intermediate districts in an equal amount per pupil based on the total number of pupils in membership in each district.

The department shall ensure that the amount per pupil paid to nonpublic schools does not exceed the amount per pupil paid to districts and intermediate districts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If funding remains after the distribution of funds as described in subsection (2), the department may provide additional per-pupil allocations to allocate remaining dollars, using for those calculations the same requirements described in subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as otherwise provided in this section, to receive funding under this section, districts, intermediate districts, and nonpublic schools must apply for funding under this section in a form and manner prescribed by the department.

An intermediate district or consortium shall use funds allocated under this section for great start readiness programs to provide part-day, school-day, GSRP extended programs, or GSRP/Head Start blended comprehensive free compensatory classroom programs designed to improve the readiness and subsequent achievement of educationally disadvantaged children who meet the participant eligibility and prioritization guidelines as defined by the department. For a child to be eligible to participate in a program under this section, the child must be at least 4, but less than 5, years of age as of September 1 of the school year in which the program is offered and must meet those eligibility and prioritization guidelines. A child who is not 4 years of age as of September 1, but who will be 4 years of age not later than December 1, is eligible to participate if the child's parent or legal guardian seeks a waiver from the September 1 eligibility date by submitting a request for enrollment in a program to the responsible intermediate district, if the program has capacity on or after September 1 of the school year, and if the child meets eligibility and prioritization guidelines.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) From the state school aid fund money allocated under subsection (1), an amount not to exceed $367,120,000.00 for 2022-2023 and $522,720,000.00 for 2023-2024, and from the federal funds allocated under subsection (1), an amount not to exceed $83,000,000.00 for 2022-2023, is allocated to intermediate districts or consortia of intermediate districts based on the formula in section 39. An intermediate district or consortium of intermediate districts receiving funding under this section shall act as the fiduciary for the great start readiness programs. An intermediate district or consortium of intermediate districts receiving funding under this section may collaborate with local governments to identify children eligible for programs funded under this section and may contract with local governments to provide services. In order to be eligible to receive funds allocated under this subsection from an intermediate district or consortium of intermediate districts, a district, a consortium of districts, a local government, or a public or private for-profit or nonprofit legal entity or agency must comply with this section and section 39. If, due to the number of GSRP extended program slots awarded, the amount allocated in this subsection is not sufficient to award at least the same number of part-day program and school-day program slots as awarded in the immediately preceding fiscal year, there is appropriated from the great start readiness program reserve fund the amount necessary to fully award the same number of part-day program and full-day program slots as awarded in the immediately preceding fiscal year. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In addition to the allocation under subsection (1), from the general fund money appropriated under section 11, there is allocated an amount not to exceed $500,000.00 for 2022-2023 and $600,000.00 for 2023-2024 for a competitive grant to continue a longitudinal evaluation of children who have participated in great start readiness programs. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) To be eligible for funding under this section, a program must prepare children for success in school through comprehensive part-day, school-day, GSRP extended programs, or GSRP/Head Start blended programs that contain all of the following program components, as determined by the department:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Participation in a collaborative recruitment and enrollment process to assure that each child is enrolled in the program most appropriate to the child's needs and to maximize the use of federal, state, and local funds.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Physical and dental health and developmental screening services for all program participants.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Referral services for families of program participants to community social service agencies, including mental health services, as appropriate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Active and continuous involvement of the parents or guardians of the program participants.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) A plan to conduct and report annual great start readiness program evaluations and continuous improvement plans using criteria approved by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Participation in a school readiness advisory committee convened as a workgroup of the great start collaborative that provides for the involvement of classroom teachers, parents or guardians of program participants, and community, volunteer, and social service agencies and organizations, as appropriate. The advisory committee annually shall review and make recommendations regarding the program components listed in this subsection. The advisory committee also shall make recommendations to the great start collaborative regarding other community services designed to improve all children's school readiness.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The ongoing articulation of the kindergarten and first grade programs offered by the program provider.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Participation in this state's great start to quality process with a rating of at least, for 2022-2023, 3 stars, and, for 2023-2024, enhancing quality level.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An application for funding under this section must provide for the following, in a form and manner determined by the department:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Ensure compliance with all program components described in subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, ensure that at least 85% of the children participating in an eligible great start readiness program for whom the intermediate district is receiving funds under this section are children who live with families with a household income that is equal to or less than, for 2022-2023, 250%, and, for 2023-2024, 300% of the federal poverty guidelines. If the intermediate district determines that all eligible children are being served and that there are no children on the waiting list who live with families with a household income that is equal to or less than, for 2022-2023, 250%, and, for 2023-2024, 300% of the federal poverty guidelines, the intermediate district may then enroll children who live with families with a household income that is equal to or less than, for 2022-2023, 300%, and, for 2023-2024, 400% of the federal poverty guidelines. The enrollment process must consider income and risk factors, such that children determined with higher need are enrolled before children with lesser need. For purposes of this subdivision, all age-eligible children served in foster care or who are experiencing homelessness or who have individualized education programs recommending placement in an inclusive preschool setting are considered to live with families with household income equal to or less than, for 2022-2023, 250%, and, for 2023-2024, 300% of the federal poverty guidelines regardless of actual family income and are prioritized for enrollment within the lowest quintile.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Ensure that the applicant only uses qualified personnel for this program, as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Teachers possessing proper training. A lead teacher must have a valid Michigan teaching certificate with an early childhood or lower elementary endorsement or a bachelor's or higher degree in child development or early childhood education with specialization in preschool teaching. However, except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, if an applicant demonstrates to the department that it is unable to fully comply with this subparagraph after making reasonable efforts to comply, teachers or paraprofessionals with at least 5 years of experience as a paraprofessional in a great start readiness program, Head Start, or licensed child care center classroom who have significant but incomplete training in early childhood education or child development may be used if the applicant provides to the department, and the department approves, a plan for each teacher to come into compliance with the standards in this subparagraph. Beginning in 2023-2024, individuals may qualify with at least 3 years of experience and significant training in early childhood education or child development, based on the recommendation of the intermediate district after a classroom observation. A teacher's compliance plan must be completed within 3 years of the date of employment. Progress toward completion of the compliance plan consists of at least 2 courses per calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Paraprofessionals possessing proper training in early childhood education, including an associate degree in early childhood education or child development or the equivalent, or a child development associate (CDA) credential. However, if an applicant demonstrates to the department that it is unable to fully comply with this subparagraph after making reasonable efforts to comply, the applicant may use paraprofessionals who have completed at least 1 course that earns college credit in early childhood education or child development or, beginning in 2023-2024, enrolls in a child development associate credential with at least 6 months of verified experience in early education and care, if the applicant provides to the department, and the department approves, a plan for each paraprofessional to come into compliance with the standards in this subparagraph. A paraprofessional's compliance plan must be completed within 3 years of the date of employment. Progress toward completion of the compliance plan consists of at least 2 courses, 60 clock hours, or an equivalent of training per calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Include a program budget that contains only those costs that are not reimbursed or reimbursable by federal funding, that are clearly and directly attributable to the great start readiness program, and that would not be incurred if the program were not being offered. Eligible costs include transportation costs. The program budget must indicate the extent to which these funds will supplement other federal, state, local, or private funds. An applicant shall not use funds received under this section to supplant any federal funds received by the applicant to serve children eligible for a federally funded preschool program that has the capacity to serve those children.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For a grant recipient that enrolls pupils in a school-day program or GSRP extended program funded under this section, each child enrolled in the school-day program or GSRP extended program is counted as described in section 39 for purposes of determining the amount of the grant award.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For a grant recipient that enrolls pupils in a GSRP/Head Start blended program, the grant recipient shall ensure that all Head Start and GSRP policies and regulations are applied to the blended slots, with adherence to the highest standard from either program, to the extent allowable under federal law.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) An intermediate district or consortium of intermediate districts receiving a grant under this section shall designate an early childhood coordinator, and may provide services directly or may contract with 1 or more districts or public or private for-profit or nonprofit providers that meet all requirements of subsections (4) and (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An intermediate district or consortium of intermediate districts may retain for administrative services provided by the intermediate district or consortium of intermediate districts an amount not to exceed 4% of the grant amount. Expenses incurred by subrecipients engaged by the intermediate district or consortium of intermediate districts for directly running portions of the program are considered program costs or a contracted program fee for service. Subrecipients operating with a federally approved indirect rate for other early childhood programs may include indirect costs, not to exceed the federal 10% de minimis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) An intermediate district or consortium of intermediate districts may expend not more than 2% of the total grant amount for outreach, recruiting, and public awareness of the program, if the intermediate district or consortium of intermediate districts also participates in related statewide marketing and outreach efforts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Each grant recipient shall enroll children identified under subsection (5)(b) according to how far the child's household income is below, for 2022-2023, 250%, and, for 2023-2024, 300% of the federal poverty guidelines by ranking each applicant child's household income from lowest to highest and dividing the applicant children into quintiles based on how far the child's household income is below, for 2022-2023, 250%, and, for 2023-2024, 300% of the federal poverty guidelines, and then enrolling children in the quintile with the lowest household income before enrolling children in the quintile with the next lowest household income until slots are completely filled.

For the purposes of this 30% allocation, an intermediate district or consortium of intermediate districts may count children served by a Head Start grantee or delegate in a blended Head Start, GSRP extended program, and great start readiness school-day program. Children served in a program funded only through Head Start are not counted toward this 30% allocation. The intermediate district or consortium shall report to the department, in a manner prescribed by the department, a detailed list of community-based providers by provider type, including private for-profit, private nonprofit, community college or university, Head Start grantee or delegate, and district or intermediate district, and the number and proportion of its total allocation allocated to each provider as subrecipient. If the intermediate district or consortium is not able to contract for at least 30% of its total allocation, the grant recipient shall notify the department and, if the department verifies that the intermediate district or consortium attempted to contract for at least 30% of its total allocation and was not able to do so, then the intermediate district or consortium may retain and use all of its allocation as provided under this section. To be able to use this exemption, the intermediate district or consortium shall demonstrate to the department that the intermediate district or consortium increased the percentage of its total allocation for which it contracts with a community-based provider and the intermediate district or consortium shall submit evidence satisfactory to the department, and the department must be able to verify this evidence, demonstrating that the intermediate district or consortium took measures to contract for at least 30% of its total allocation as required under this subsection, including, but not limited to, at least all of the following measures:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The intermediate district or consortium provided to the public and to participating families a list of community-based great start readiness program subrecipients with a great start to quality rating of at least, for 2022-2023, 3 stars, and, for 2023-2024, enhancing quality level.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) If an intermediate district or consortium of intermediate districts receiving a grant under this section fails to submit satisfactory evidence to demonstrate its effort to contract for at least 30% of its total allocation, as required under subsection (13), the department shall reduce the allocation to the intermediate district or consortium by a percentage equal to the difference between the percentage of an intermediate district's or consortium's total allocation awarded to community-based providers and 30% of its total allocation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) In order to assist intermediate districts and consortia in complying with the requirement to contract with community-based providers for at least 30% of their total allocation, the department shall do all of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Ensure that all intermediate district, district, community college or university, Head Start grantee or delegate, private for-profit, and private nonprofit providers are subject to a single great start to quality rating system. The rating system must ensure that regulators process all prospective providers at the same pace on a first-come, first-served basis and must not allow 1 type of provider to receive a great start to quality rating ahead of any other type of provider.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Not later than March 1 of each year, compile the results of the information reported by each intermediate district or consortium under subsection (13) and report to the legislature and post on a publicly available website a list by intermediate district or consortium with the number and percentage of each intermediate district's or consortium's total allocation allocated to community-based providers by provider type, including private for-profit, private nonprofit, community college or university, Head Start grantee or delegate, and district or intermediate district.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>388.1632p Early childhood funding; local great start collaborative and family coalition; outcomes; workgroups; home visits to at-risk children and families; report; improving access to books and literacy materials; carrying over unexpended funds.</B><P>Sec. 32p.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) From the state school aid fund money appropriated in section 11, there is allocated an amount not to exceed $19,400,000.00 to intermediate districts for 2023-2024 for the purpose of providing early childhood funding to intermediate districts to support the goals and outcomes under subsections (2) and (4), and to provide supports for early childhood programs for children from birth through age 8. The funding provided to each intermediate district under this section is determined by the distribution formula established by the department's office of great start to provide equitable funding statewide. In order to receive funding under this section, each intermediate district must provide an application to the office of great start not later than September 15 of the immediately preceding fiscal year indicating the strategies planned to be provided.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Each intermediate district or consortium of intermediate districts that receives funding under this section shall convene a local great start collaborative and a family coalition that includes an active partnership with at least 1 community-based organization. The goal of each great start collaborative and family coalition is to ensure the coordination and expansion of local early childhood systems and programs that allow every child in the community to achieve the following outcomes:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Children born healthy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Children healthy, thriving, and developmentally on track from birth to grade 3.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Children developmentally ready to succeed in school at the time of school entry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Children prepared to succeed in fourth grade and beyond by reading proficiently by the end of third grade.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Each local great start collaborative and family coalition shall convene workgroups to make recommendations about community services designed to achieve the outcomes described in subsection (2) and to ensure that its local great start system includes the following supports for children from birth through age 8:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Physical and social-emotional health.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Family supports, including, but not limited to, the provision of basic needs and economic self-sufficiency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Parent leadership and family engagement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Early education, including the child's development of skills linked to success in foundational literacy, and care.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Community infrastructure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) From the funds allocated in subsection (1), at least $3,500,000.00 must be used for the purpose of providing home visits to at-risk children and their families. The home visits must be conducted as part of a locally coordinated, family-centered, evidence-based, data-driven home visit strategic plan that is approved by the department. The goals of the home visits funded under this subsection are to improve school readiness using evidence-based methods, including a focus on developmentally appropriate outcomes for early literacy, to improve positive parenting practices, and to improve family economic self-sufficiency while reducing the impact of high-risk factors through community resources and referrals. The department shall coordinate the goals of the home visit strategic plans approved under this subsection with other state agency home visit programs in a way that strengthens Michigan's home visiting infrastructure and maximizes federal funds available for the purposes of at-risk family home visits. The coordination among departments and agencies is intended to avoid duplication of state services and spending, and should emphasize efficient service delivery of home visiting programs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Not later than December 1 of each year, each intermediate district shall provide a report to the department detailing the strategies actually implemented during the immediately preceding school year and the families and children actually served. At a minimum, the report must include an evaluation of the services provided with additional funding under subsection (4) for home visits, using the goals identified in subsection (4) as the basis for the evaluation, including the degree to which school readiness was improved, the degree to which positive parenting practices were improved, the degree to which there was improved family economic self-sufficiency, and the degree to which community resources and referrals were utilized. The department shall compile and summarize these reports and submit its summary to the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on school aid and to the house and senate fiscal agencies not later than February 15 of each year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) In addition to the funds allocated in subsection (1), from the state school aid fund money appropriated in section 11, there is allocated an amount not to exceed $4,000,000.00 for 2023-2024 only for the purpose of improving access to books and other literacy materials for children from birth to age 5. The formula described in subsection (1) must be used to allocate funds to intermediate districts under this subsection. An intermediate district may use the funding to support programs, including, but not limited to, the Dolly Parton Imagination Library, Reach Out and Read Michigan, or any other program that provides books and literacy materials to children from birth to age 5. If funding under this subsection is not sufficient to enroll all interested families in the service, each intermediate district must prioritize enrollment to those families with the highest levels of economic need. If an intermediate district will not fully utilize funding under this subsection, those funds must be returned to the department for redistribution for the purposes under this subsection. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An intermediate district or consortium of intermediate districts that receives funding under this section may carry over any unexpended funds received under this section into the next fiscal year and may expend those unused funds through June 30 of the next fiscal year. However, an intermediate district or consortium of intermediate districts that receives funding for the purposes described in subsection (2) in the current fiscal year shall not carry over into the next fiscal year any amount exceeding 15% of the amount awarded to the intermediate district or consortium in the current fiscal year. A recipient of a grant shall return any unexpended grant funds to the department in the manner prescribed by the department not later than September 30 of the next fiscal year after the fiscal year in which the funds are received.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An eligible applicant receiving funds under section 32d shall submit an application, in a form and manner prescribed by the department, by a date specified by the department in the immediately preceding fiscal year. An eligible applicant is not required to amend the applicant's current accounting cycle or adopt this state's fiscal year accounting cycle in accounting for financial transactions under this section. The application must include all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The estimated total number of children in the community who meet the criteria of section 32d and the total number of age-eligible children in the community, as provided to the applicant by the department utilizing the most recent population data available from the American Community Survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau. The department shall ensure that it provides updated American Community Survey population data at least once every 3 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The estimated number of children in the community who meet the criteria of section 32d and are being served exclusively by Head Start programs operating in the community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The number of children whom the applicant has the capacity to serve who meet the criteria of section 32d including a verification of physical facility and staff resources capacity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) After notification of funding allocations, an applicant receiving funds under section 32d shall also submit an implementation plan for approval, in a form and manner prescribed by the department, by a date specified by the department, that details how the applicant complies with the program components established by the department under section 32d.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The initial allocation to each eligible applicant under section 32d is the lesser of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The sum of the number of children served in a school-day program in the preceding school year multiplied by $9,608.00, the number of children served in a GSRP extended program in the preceding school year multiplied by $11,530.00, and the number of children served in a GSRP/Head Start blended program or a part-day program in the preceding school year multiplied by $4,804.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The sum of the number of children the applicant has the capacity to serve in the current school year in a school-day program multiplied by $9,608.00, the number of children served in a GSRP extended program the applicant has the capacity to serve in the current school year multiplied by $11,530.00, and the number of children served in a GSRP/Head Start blended program or a part-day program the applicant has the capacity to serve in the current school year multiplied by $4,804.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If funds remain after the allocations under subsection (3), the department shall distribute the remaining funds to each intermediate district or consortium of intermediate districts that serves less than the state percentage benchmark determined under subsection (5). The department shall distribute these remaining funds to each eligible applicant based upon each applicant's proportionate share of the remaining unserved children necessary to meet the statewide percentage benchmark in intermediate districts or consortia of intermediate districts serving less than the statewide percentage benchmark. When all applicants have been given the opportunity to reach the statewide percentage benchmark, the statewide percentage benchmark may be reset, as determined by the department, until greater equity of opportunity to serve eligible children across all intermediate school districts has been achieved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) For the purposes of subsection (4), the department shall calculate a percentage of children served by each intermediate district or consortium of intermediate districts by adding the number of children served in the immediately preceding year by that intermediate district or consortium with the number of eligible children under section 32d served exclusively by Head Start, as reported in a form and manner prescribed by the department, within the intermediate district or consortia service area and dividing that total by the total number of children within the intermediate district or consortium of intermediate districts who meet the criteria of section 32d as determined by the department utilizing the most recent population data available from the American Community Survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau. The department shall compare the resulting percentage of eligible children served to a statewide percentage benchmark to determine if the intermediate district or consortium is eligible for additional funds under subsection (4). The statewide percentage benchmark is 100%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If, taking into account the total amount to be allocated to the applicant as calculated under this section, an applicant determines that it is able to include additional eligible children in the great start readiness program without additional funds under section 32d, the applicant may include additional eligible children but does not receive additional funding under section 32d for those children.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The department shall review the program components under section 32d and under this section at least biennially. The department also shall convene a committee of internal and external stakeholders at least once every 5 years to ensure that the funding structure under this section reflects current system needs under section 32d.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this section, "GSRP/Head Start blended program", "GSRP extended program", "part-day program", and "school-day program" mean those terms as defined in section 32d.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) From the state school aid fund money in section 11, there is allocated an amount not to exceed $1,593,296,100.00 for 2022-2023 and there is allocated an amount not to exceed $1,694,646,100.00 for 2023-2024 from state sources and all available federal funding under sections 1411 to 1419 of part B of the individuals with disabilities education act, 20 USC 1411 to 1419, estimated at $390,000,000.00 for 2022-2023 and $390,000,000.00 for 2023-2024, plus any carryover federal funds from previous year appropriations. In addition, from the state school aid fund money in section 11, there is allocated an amount not to exceed $76,150,000.00 for 2023-2024 only to supplement the allocations in this section. The allocations under this subsection are for the purpose of reimbursing districts and intermediate districts for special education programs, services, and special education personnel as prescribed in article 3 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1701 to 380.1761; net tuition payments made by intermediate districts to the Michigan Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and special education programs and services for pupils who are eligible for special education programs and services according to statute or rule. For meeting the costs of special education programs and services not reimbursed under this article, a district or intermediate district may use money in general funds or special education funds, not otherwise restricted, or contributions from districts to intermediate districts, tuition payments, gifts and contributions from individuals or other entities, or federal funds that may be available for this purpose, as determined by the intermediate district plan prepared under article 3 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1701 to 380.1761. Notwithstanding section 17b, the department shall make payments of federal funds to districts, intermediate districts, and other eligible entities under this section on a schedule determined by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) From the funds allocated under subsection (1), there is allocated the amount necessary, estimated at $357,400,000.00 for 2022-2023 and estimated at $368,000,000.00 for 2023-2024, for payments toward reimbursing districts and intermediate districts for 28.6138% of total approved costs of special education, excluding costs reimbursed under section 53a, and 70.4165% of total approved costs of special education transportation. Allocations under this subsection are made as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For 2022-2023, the department shall calculate the initial amount allocated to a district under this subsection toward fulfilling the specified percentages by multiplying the district's special education pupil membership, excluding pupils described in subsection (11), times 25% of the foundation allowance under section 20 of the pupil's district of residence, plus 25% of the amount of the district's per-pupil allocation under section 20m, not to exceed 25% of the target foundation allowance for the current fiscal year, or, for a special education pupil in membership in a district that is a public school academy, times an amount equal to 25% of the amount per membership pupil calculated under section 20(6). For an intermediate district, the amount allocated under this subdivision toward fulfilling the specified percentages is an amount per special education membership pupil, excluding pupils described in subsection (11), and is calculated in the same manner as for a district, using 25% of the foundation allowance under section 20 of the pupil's district of residence, not to exceed 25% of the target foundation allowance for the current fiscal year, and that district's per-pupil allocation under section 20m.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For 2022-2023, after the allocation under subdivision (a), the department shall pay a district or intermediate district for which the payments calculated under subdivision (a) do not fulfill the specified percentages the amount necessary to achieve the specified percentages for the district or intermediate district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Beginning in 2023-2024, subdivisions (a) and (b) no longer apply.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) From the funds allocated under subsection (1), there is allocated for 2022-2023 an amount not to exceed $1,000,000.00 and there is allocated for 2023-2024 an amount not to exceed $1,000,000.00 to make payments to districts and intermediate districts under this subsection. If the amount allocated to a district or intermediate district for the fiscal year under subsection (2) is less than the sum of the amounts allocated to the district or intermediate district for 1996-97 under sections 52 and 58, there is allocated to the district or intermediate district for the fiscal year an amount equal to that difference, adjusted by applying the same proration factor that was used in the distribution of funds under section 52 in 1996-97 as adjusted to the district's or intermediate district's necessary costs of special education used in calculations for the fiscal year. This adjustment is to reflect reductions in special education program operations or services between 1996-97 and subsequent fiscal years. The department shall make adjustments for reductions in special education program operations or services in a manner determined by the department and shall include adjustments for program or service shifts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the department determines that the sum of the amounts allocated for a fiscal year to a district or intermediate district under subsection (2) is not sufficient to fulfill the specified percentages in subsection (2), the department shall pay the shortfall to the district or intermediate district during the fiscal year beginning on the October 1 following the determination and shall adjust payments under subsection (3) as necessary. If the department determines that the sum of the amounts allocated for a fiscal year to a district or intermediate district under subsection (2) exceeds the sum of the amount necessary to fulfill the specified percentages in subsection (2), the department shall deduct the amount of the excess from the district's or intermediate district's payments under this article for the fiscal year beginning on the October 1 following the determination and shall adjust payments under subsection (3) as necessary. For 2022-2023, if the amount allocated under subsection (2)(a) in itself exceeds the amount necessary to fulfill the specified percentages in subsection (2), there is no deduction under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) State funds are allocated on a total approved cost basis. Federal funds are allocated under applicable federal requirements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) From the amount allocated in subsection (1), there is allocated an amount not to exceed $2,200,000.00 for 2022-2023 and there is allocated an amount not to exceed $2,200,000.00 for 2023-2024 to reimburse 100% of the net increase in necessary costs incurred by a district or intermediate district in implementing the revisions in the administrative rules for special education that became effective on July 1, 1987. As used in this subsection, "net increase in necessary costs" means the necessary additional costs incurred solely because of new or revised requirements in the administrative rules minus cost savings permitted in implementing the revised rules. The department shall determine net increase in necessary costs in a manner specified by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For purposes of this section and sections 51b to 58, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Total approved costs of special education" are determined in a manner specified by the department and may include indirect costs, but must not exceed 115% of approved direct costs for section 52 and section 53a programs. The total approved costs include salary and other compensation for all approved special education personnel for the program, including payments for Social Security and Medicare and public school employee retirement system contributions. The total approved costs do not include salaries or other compensation paid to administrative personnel who are not special education personnel as that term is defined in section 6 of the revised school code, MCL 380.6. Costs reimbursed by federal funds, other than those federal funds included in the allocation made under this article, are not included. Special education approved personnel not utilized full time in the evaluation of students or in the delivery of special education programs, ancillary, and other related services are reimbursed under this section only for that portion of time actually spent providing these programs and services, with the exception of special education programs and services provided to youth placed in child caring institutions or juvenile detention programs approved by the department to provide an on-grounds education program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A district or intermediate district that employed special education support services staff to provide special education support services in 2003-2004 or in a subsequent fiscal year and that in a fiscal year after 2003-2004 receives the same type of support services from another district or intermediate district shall report the cost of those support services for special education reimbursement purposes under this article. This subdivision does not prohibit the transfer of special education classroom teachers and special education classroom aides if the pupils counted in membership associated with those special education classroom teachers and special education classroom aides are transferred and counted in membership in the other district or intermediate district in conjunction with the transfer of those teachers and aides.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the department determines before bookclosing for a fiscal year that the amounts allocated for that fiscal year under subsections (2), (3), (6), and (11) and sections 53a, 54, and 56 will exceed expenditures for that fiscal year under subsections (2), (3), (6), and (11) and sections 53a, 54, and 56, then for a district or intermediate district whose reimbursement for that fiscal year would otherwise be affected by subdivision (b), subdivision (b) does not apply to the calculation of the reimbursement for that district or intermediate district and the department shall calculate reimbursement for that district or intermediate district in the same manner as it was for 2003-2004. If the amount of the excess allocations under subsections (2), (3), (6), and (11) and sections 53a, 54, and 56 is not sufficient to fully fund the calculation of reimbursement to those districts and intermediate districts under this subdivision, then the department shall prorate calculations and resulting reimbursement under this subdivision on an equal percentage basis. The amount of reimbursement under this subdivision for a fiscal year must not exceed $2,000,000.00 for any district or intermediate district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Reimbursement for ancillary and other related services, as that term is defined by R 340.1701c of the Michigan Administrative Code, is not provided when those services are covered by and available through private group health insurance carriers or federal reimbursed program sources unless the department and district or intermediate district agree otherwise and that agreement is approved by the state budget director. Expenses, other than the incidental expense of filing, must not be borne by the parent. In addition, the filing of claims must not delay the education of a pupil. A district or intermediate district is responsible for payment of a deductible amount and for an advance payment required until the time a claim is paid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If an intermediate district purchases a special education pupil transportation service from a constituent district that was previously purchased from a private entity; if the purchase from the constituent district is at a lower cost, adjusted for changes in fuel costs; and if the cost shift from the intermediate district to the constituent does not result in any net change in the revenue the constituent district receives from payments under sections 22b and 51c, then upon application by the intermediate district, the department shall direct the intermediate district to continue to report the cost associated with the specific identified special education pupil transportation service and shall adjust the costs reported by the constituent district to remove the cost associated with that specific service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A pupil who is enrolled in a full-time special education program conducted or administered by an intermediate district or a pupil who is enrolled in the Michigan Schools for the Deaf and Blind is not included in the membership count of a district, but is counted in membership in the intermediate district of residence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Special education personnel transferred from 1 district to another to implement the revised school code are entitled to the rights, benefits, and tenure to which the individual would otherwise be entitled had that individual been employed by the receiving district originally.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If a district or intermediate district uses money received under this section for a purpose other than the purpose or purposes for which the money is allocated, the department may require the district or intermediate district to refund the amount of money received. The department shall deposit money that is refunded in the state treasury to the credit of the state school aid fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) From the funds allocated in subsection (1), there is allocated the amount necessary, estimated at $2,000,000.00 for 2022-2023 and estimated at $2,000,000.00 for 2023-2024, to pay the foundation allowances for pupils described in this subsection. The department shall calculate the allocation to a district under this subsection by multiplying the number of pupils described in this subsection who are counted in membership in the district times the sum of the foundation allowance under section 20 of the pupil's district of residence, plus the amount of the district's per-pupil allocation under section 20m, not to exceed the target foundation allowance for the current fiscal year, or, for a pupil described in this subsection who is counted in membership in a district that is a public school academy, times an amount equal to the amount per membership pupil under section 20(6). The department shall calculate the allocation to an intermediate district under this subsection in the same manner as for a district, using the foundation allowance under section 20 of the pupil's district of residence not to exceed the target foundation allowance for the current fiscal year and that district's per-pupil allocation under section 20m. This subsection applies to all of the following pupils:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Pupils described in section 53a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Pupils counted in membership in an intermediate district who are not special education pupils and are served by the intermediate district in a juvenile detention or child caring facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Pupils with an emotional impairment counted in membership by an intermediate district and provided educational services by the department of health and human services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If it is determined that funds allocated under subsection (2) or (11) or under section 51c will not be expended, funds up to the amount necessary and available may be used to supplement the allocations under subsection (2) or (11) or under section 51c in order to fully fund those allocations. After payments under subsections (2) and (11) and section 51c, the department shall expend the remaining funds from the allocation in subsection (1) in the following order:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) One hundred percent of the reimbursement required under section 53a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) One hundred percent of the reimbursement required under subsection (6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) One hundred percent of the payment required under section 54.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) One hundred percent of the payment required under subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) One hundred percent of the payments under section 56.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The allocations under subsections (2), (3), and (11) are allocations to intermediate districts only and are not allocations to districts, but instead are calculations used only to determine the state payments under section 22b.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) If a public school academy that is not a cyber school, as that term is defined in section 551 of the revised school code, MCL 380.551, enrolls under this section a pupil who resides outside of the intermediate district in which the public school academy is located and who is eligible for special education programs and services according to statute or rule, or who is a child with a disability, as that term is defined under the individuals with disabilities education act, Public Law 108-446, the intermediate district in which the public school academy is located and the public school academy shall enter into a written agreement with the intermediate district in which the pupil resides for the purpose of providing the pupil with a free appropriate public education, and the written agreement must include at least an agreement on the responsibility for the payment of the added costs of special education programs and services for the pupil. If the public school academy that enrolls the pupil does not enter into an agreement under this subsection, the public school academy shall not charge the pupil's resident intermediate district or the intermediate district in which the public school academy is located the added costs of special education programs and services for the pupil, and the public school academy is not eligible for any payouts based on the funding formula outlined in the resident or nonresident intermediate district's plan. If a pupil is not enrolled in a public school academy under this subsection, the provision of special education programs and services and the payment of the added costs of special education programs and services for a pupil described in this subsection are the responsibility of the district and intermediate district in which the pupil resides.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) For the purpose of receiving its federal allocation under part B of the individuals with disabilities education act, Public Law 108-446, a public school academy that is a cyber school, as that term is defined in section 551 of the revised school code, MCL 380.551, and is in compliance with section 553a of the revised school code, MCL 380.553a, directly receives the federal allocation under part B of the individuals with disabilities education act, Public Law 108-446, from the intermediate district in which the cyber school is located, as the subrecipient. If the intermediate district does not distribute the funds described in this subsection to the cyber school by the part B application due date of July 1, the department may distribute the funds described in this subsection directly to the cyber school according to the formula prescribed in 34 CFR 300.705 and 34 CFR 300.816. Beginning July 1, 2021, this subsection is subject to section 8c. It is the intent of the legislature that the immediately preceding sentence apply retroactively and is effective July 1, 2021.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) For a public school academy that is a cyber school, as that term is defined in section 551 of the revised school code, MCL 380.551, and is in compliance with section 553a of the revised school code, MCL 380.553a, that enrolls a pupil under this section, the intermediate district in which the cyber school is located shall ensure that the cyber school complies with sections 1701a, 1703, 1704, 1751, 1752, 1756, and 1757 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1701a, 380.1703, 380.1704, 380.1751, 380.1752, 380.1756, and 380.1757; applicable rules; and the individuals with disabilities education act, Public Law 108-446. Beginning July 1, 2021, this subsection is subject to section 8c. It is the intent of the legislature that the immediately preceding sentence apply retroactively and is effective July 1, 2021.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) For the purposes of this section, the department or the center shall only require a district or intermediate district to report information that is not already available from the financial information database maintained by the center.</div>

As a condition of receiving funds under this section, an intermediate district distributing any portion of special education millage funds to its constituent districts must submit for departmental approval and implement a distribution plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, reimbursement for those millages levied in 2021-2022 is made in 2022-2023 at an amount per 2021-2022 membership pupil computed by subtracting from $229,600.00 the 2021-2022 taxable value behind each membership pupil and multiplying the resulting difference by the 2021-2022 millage levied, and then subtracting from that amount the 2021-2022 local community stabilization share revenue for special education purposes and 2021-2022 tax increment revenues captured by a brownfield redevelopment authority created under the brownfield redevelopment financing act, 1996 PA 381, MCL 125.2651 to 125.2670, behind each membership pupil for reimbursement of personal property exemption loss under the local community stabilization authority act, 2014 PA 86, MCL 123.1341 to 123.1362, and reimbursements paid under section 26d for tax increment revenues captured by a brownfield redevelopment authority under the brownfield redevelopment financing act, 1996 PA 381, MCL 125.2651 to 125.2670. For the purposes of the calculation described in the previous sentence only, for an intermediate district receiving funds under this section and section 62, reimbursements paid under section 26d must be multiplied by the ratio of special education millage levied, as defined in this section, and the sum of special education millage levied and vocational-technical education millage levied, as defined in section 62. Reimbursement in 2022-2023 for an intermediate district whose 2017-2018 allocation was affected by the operation of subsection (5) is an amount equal to 102.5% of the 2017-2018 allocation to that intermediate district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, reimbursement for those millages levied in 2022-2023 is made in 2023-2024 at an amount per 2022-2023 membership pupil computed by subtracting from $238,800.00 the 2022-2023 taxable value behind each membership pupil and multiplying the resulting difference by the 2022-2023 millage levied, and then subtracting from that amount the 2022-2023 local community stabilization share revenue for special education purposes and 2022-2023 tax increment revenues captured by a brownfield redevelopment authority created under the brownfield redevelopment financing act, 1996 PA 381, MCL 125.2651 to 125.2670, behind each membership pupil for reimbursement of personal property exemption loss under the local community stabilization authority act, 2014 PA 86, MCL 123.1341 to 123.1362, and reimbursements paid under section 26d for tax increment revenues captured by a brownfield redevelopment authority under the brownfield redevelopment financing act, 1996 PA 381, MCL 125.2651 to 125.2670. For the purposes of the calculation described in the previous sentence only, for an intermediate district receiving funds under this section and section 62, reimbursements paid under section 26d must be multiplied by the ratio of special education millage levied, as defined in this section, and the sum of special education millage levied and vocational-technical education millage levied, as defined in section 62. Reimbursement in 2023-2024 for an intermediate district whose 2017-2018 allocation was affected by the operation of subsection (5) is an amount equal to 102.5% of the 2017-2018 allocation to that intermediate district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The department shall ensure that the amount paid to a single intermediate district under subsection (2) does not exceed 62.9% of the total amount allocated under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The department shall ensure that the amount paid to a single intermediate district under subsection (2) is not less than 75% of the amount allocated to the intermediate district under subsection (2) for the immediately preceding fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) From the allocation under section 51a(1), there is allocated an amount not to exceed $34,200,000.00 for 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 to provide payments to intermediate districts levying millages for special education under part 30 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1711 to 380.1741. The purpose, use, and expenditure of the payments under this subsection are limited as if the funds were generated by these millages and governed by the intermediate district plan adopted under article 3 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1701 to 380.1761. The department shall provide a payment under this subsection to each intermediate district described in this subsection as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For 2022-2023 and 2023-2024, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, for an intermediate district with a 3-year average special education millage revenue per pupil in the immediately preceding fiscal year that is less than $251.00 and that is levying at least 46.2% but less than 60.0% of its maximum millage rate allowed under section 1724a of the revised school code, MCL 380.1724a, an amount computed by subtracting from $251.00 the 3-year average special education millage revenue per pupil in the immediately preceding fiscal year and, only if the millage levied by the intermediate district is less than 1, multiplying that amount by the number of mills levied divided by 1, and then multiplying that amount by the 3-year average membership in the immediately preceding fiscal year, and then subtracting from that amount the amount allocated under subsection (2) for the current fiscal year. If the calculation under this subdivision results in an amount below zero, there is no payment under this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For 2022-2023 and 2023-2024, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, for an intermediate district with a 3-year average special education millage revenue per pupil in the immediately preceding fiscal year that is less than $296.00 and that is levying at least 60.0% of its maximum millage rate allowed under section 1724a of the revised school code, MCL 380.1724a, an amount computed by subtracting from $296.00 the 3-year average special education millage revenue per pupil in the immediately preceding fiscal year, and, only if the millage levied by the intermediate district is less than 1, multiplying that amount by the number of mills levied divided by 1, and then multiplying that amount by the 3-year average membership in the immediately preceding fiscal year, and then subtracting from that amount the amount allocated under subsection (2) for the current fiscal year. If the calculation under this subdivision results in an amount below zero, there is no payment under this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) After making allocations to eligible intermediate districts under subsections (3), (4), and (7), if funds remain unallocated from the allocations under subsections (2) and (7), the department must allocate remaining funds to intermediate districts proportional to the amounts allocated to intermediate districts under subsections (3) and (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) As used in subsection (7):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "3-year average membership" means the 3-year average pupil membership for each of the 3 most recent fiscal years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "3-year average special education millage revenue per pupil" means the 3-year average taxable value per mill levied behind each membership pupil for each of the 3 most recent fiscal years multiplied by the millage levied in the most recent fiscal year.</div>

It is the intent of the legislature that, for 2024-2025, the allocation from the state school aid fund money appropriated in section 11 for purposes described in this subsection will be $37,611,300.00. Applications for participation in the programs must be submitted in the form prescribed by the department. The department shall determine the added cost for each career and technical education program area. The department shall prioritize the allocation of added cost funds based on the capital and program expenditures needed to operate the career and technical education programs provided; the number of pupils enrolled; the advancement of pupils through the instructional program; the existence of an articulation agreement with at least 1 postsecondary institution that provides pupils with opportunities to earn postsecondary credit during the pupil's participation in the career and technical education program and transfers those credits to the postsecondary institution upon completion of the career and technical education program; and the program rank in student placement, job openings, and wages, and shall ensure that the allocation does not exceed 75% of the added cost of any program. Notwithstanding any rule or department determination to the contrary, when determining a district's allocation or the formula for making allocations under this section, the department shall include the participation of pupils in grade 9 in all of those determinations and in all portions of the formula. With the approval of the department, the board of a district maintaining a secondary career and technical education program may offer the program for the period from the close of the school year until September 1.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) From the state school aid fund money appropriated in section 11, there is allocated for 2023-2024 only an amount not to exceed $15,000,000.00 to eligible career education planning districts (CEPDs) for the purposes described in this section. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) To be eligible to receive funding in the first round of grants under this section, at least 50% of the area served by a CEPD must be located in an intermediate district that did not levy a vocational education millage in 2023. Each eligible CEPD must apply in a form and manner prescribed by the department. An application must include the funding amount requested by the CEPD. Funding to an eligible CEPD must be equal to the quotient of the allocation under subsection (1) and the number of eligible CEPDs applying for funding in the first round of grants, or the individual CEPD's requested funding amount, whichever is less.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If funding remains after the first round of grants under subsection (2), the department may administer a second round of grants under this section. To be eligible to receive funding in the second round of grants, a CEPD must not have been eligible for funding in the first round of grants. Each eligible CEPD must apply in a form and manner prescribed by the department. An application must include the funding amount requested by the CEPD.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) For the purposes of this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Membership" means for a particular fiscal year the total membership of the intermediate district and the districts constituent to the intermediate district or the total membership of the area vocational-technical program, except that if a district has elected not to come under sections 681 to 690 of the revised school code, MCL 380.681 to 380.690, the membership of that district are not included in the membership of the intermediate district. However, the membership of a district that has elected not to come under sections 681 to 690 of the revised school code, MCL 380.681 to 380.690, is included in the membership of the intermediate district if the district meets both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The district operates the area vocational-technical education program pursuant to a contract with the intermediate district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The district contributes an annual amount to the operation of the program that is commensurate with the revenue that would have been raised for operation of the program if millage were levied in the district for the program under sections 681 to 690 of the revised school code, MCL 380.681 to 380.690.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Millage levied" means the millage levied for area vocational-technical education under sections 681 to 690 of the revised school code, MCL 380.681 to 380.690, including a levy for debt service obligations incurred as the result of borrowing for capital outlay projects and in meeting capital projects fund requirements of area vocational-technical education.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Taxable value" means the total taxable value of the districts constituent to an intermediate district or area vocational-technical education program, except that if a district has elected not to come under sections 681 to 690 of the revised school code, MCL 380.681 to 380.690, the taxable value of that district is not included in the taxable value of the intermediate district. However, the taxable value of a district that has elected not to come under sections 681 to 690 of the revised school code, MCL 380.681 to 380.690, is included in the taxable value of the intermediate district if the district meets both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The district operates the area vocational-technical education program pursuant to a contract with the intermediate district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The district contributes an annual amount to the operation of the program that is commensurate with the revenue that would have been raised for operation of the program if millage were levied in the district for the program under sections 681 to 690 of the revised school code, MCL 380.681 to 380.690.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) From the appropriation in section 11, there is allocated an amount not to exceed $9,190,000.00 each fiscal year for 2022-2023 and for 2023-2024 to reimburse intermediate districts and area vocational-technical education programs established under section 690(3) of the revised school code, MCL 380.690, levying millages for area vocational-technical education under sections 681 to 690 of the revised school code, MCL 380.681 to 380.690. The purpose, use, and expenditure of the reimbursement are limited as if the funds were generated by those millages.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Reimbursement for those millages levied in 2021-2022 is made in 2022-2023 at an amount per 2021-2022 membership pupil computed by subtracting from $237,500.00 the 2021-2022 taxable value behind each membership pupil and multiplying the resulting difference by the 2021-2022 millage levied, and then subtracting from that amount the 2021-2022 local community stabilization share revenue for area vocational technical education and 2021-2022 tax increment revenues captured by a brownfield redevelopment authority created under the brownfield redevelopment financing act, 1996 PA 381, MCL 125.2651 to 125.2670, behind each membership pupil for reimbursement of personal property exemption loss under the local community stabilization authority act, 2014 PA 86, MCL 123.1341 to 123.1362, and reimbursements paid under section 26d for tax increment revenues captured by a brownfield redevelopment authority under the brownfield redevelopment financing act, 1996 PA 381, MCL 125.2651 to 125.2670. For the purposes of the calculation described in the previous sentence only, for an intermediate district receiving funds under this section and section 56, reimbursements paid under section 26d must be multiplied by the ratio of vocational-technical education millage levied, as defined in this section, and the sum of vocational-technical education millage levied and special education millage levied, as defined in section 56.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Reimbursement for those millages levied in 2022-2023 is made in 2023-2024 at an amount per 2022-2023 membership pupil computed by subtracting from $248,800.00 the 2022-2023 taxable value behind each membership pupil and multiplying the resulting difference by the 2022-2023 millage levied, and then subtracting from that amount the 2022-2023 local community stabilization share revenue for area vocational technical education and 2022-2023 tax increment revenues captured by a brownfield redevelopment authority created under the brownfield redevelopment financing act, 1996 PA 381, MCL 125.2651 to 125.2670, behind each membership pupil for reimbursement of personal property exemption loss under the local community stabilization authority act, 2014 PA 86, MCL 123.1341 to 123.1362, and reimbursements paid under section 26d for tax increment revenues captured by a brownfield redevelopment authority under the brownfield redevelopment financing act, 1996 PA 381, MCL 125.2651 to 125.2670.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The department shall ensure that the amount paid to a single intermediate district under this section does not exceed 38.4% of the total amount allocated under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The department shall ensure that the amount paid to a single intermediate district under this section is not less than 75% of the amount allocated to the intermediate district under this section for the immediately preceding fiscal year.</div>

Therefore, the following sections of the school aid act and their associated allocations must be considered inoperative: 24, 55, 74, 75, 105a, 111, and 116. These sections will be treated as excluded from the current bill... .”In subsection (1), as amended by Act 121 of 2001, the phrase “and for 2002-2003” was vetoed by the governor September 28, 2001.Enacting section 3 of Act 521 of 2002 provides:“Enacting section 3.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) To be eligible to receive state aid under this article, not later than the fifth Wednesday after the pupil membership count day and not later than the fifth Wednesday after the supplemental count day, each district superintendent shall submit and certify to the center and the intermediate superintendent, in the form and manner prescribed by the center, the number of pupils enrolled and in regular daily attendance, including identification of tuition-paying pupils, in the district as of the pupil membership count day and as of the supplemental count day, as applicable, for the current school year. In addition, a district maintaining school during the entire year shall submit and certify to the center and the intermediate superintendent, in the form and manner prescribed by the center, the number of pupils enrolled and in regular daily attendance in the district for the current school year pursuant to rules promulgated by the superintendent. Not later than the sixth Wednesday after the pupil membership count day and not later than the sixth Wednesday after the supplemental count day, the district shall resolve any pupil membership conflicts with another district, correct any data issues, and recertify the data in a form and manner prescribed by the center and file the certified data with the intermediate superintendent. If a district fails to submit and certify the attendance data, as required under this subsection, the center shall notify the department and the department shall withhold state aid due to be distributed under this article from the defaulting district immediately, beginning with the next payment after the failure and continuing with each payment until the district complies with this subsection. If a district does not comply with this subsection by the end of the fiscal year, the district forfeits the amount withheld. A person who willfully falsifies a figure or statement in the certified and sworn copy of enrollment is subject to penalty as prescribed by section 161. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) To be eligible to receive state aid under this article, not later than the twenty-fourth Wednesday after the pupil membership count day and not later than the twenty-fourth Wednesday after the supplemental count day, an intermediate district shall submit to the center, in a form and manner prescribed by the center, the audited enrollment and attendance data as described in subsection (1) for the pupils of its constituent districts and of the intermediate district. If an intermediate district fails to submit the audited data as required under this subsection, the department shall withhold state aid due to be distributed under this article from the defaulting intermediate district immediately, beginning with the next payment after the failure and continuing with each payment until the intermediate district complies with this subsection. If an intermediate district does not comply with this subsection by the end of the fiscal year, the intermediate district forfeits the amount withheld.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (11) and (12) all of the following apply to the provision of pupil instruction:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, each district shall provide at least 1,098 hours and 180 days of pupil instruction. If a collective bargaining agreement that provides a complete school calendar was in effect for employees of a district as of June 24, 2014, and if that school calendar is not in compliance with this subdivision, then this subdivision does not apply to that district until after the expiration of that collective bargaining agreement. A district may apply for a waiver under subsection (9) from the requirements of this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Except as otherwise provided in this article, a district failing to comply with the required minimum hours and days of pupil instruction under this subsection forfeits from its total state aid allocation an amount determined by applying a ratio of the number of hours or days the district was in noncompliance in relation to the required minimum number of hours and days under this subsection. Not later than the first business day in August, the board of each district shall either certify to the department that the district was in full compliance with this section regarding the number of hours and days of pupil instruction in the previous school year, or report to the department, in a form and manner prescribed by the center, each instance of noncompliance. If the district did not provide at least the required minimum number of hours and days of pupil instruction under this subsection, the department shall make the deduction of state aid in the following fiscal year from the first payment of state school aid. A district is not subject to forfeiture of funds under this subsection for a fiscal year in which a forfeiture was already imposed under subsection (6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Hours or days lost because of strikes or teachers' conferences are not counted as hours or days of pupil instruction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (e) and (f), if a district does not have at least 75% of the district's membership in attendance on any day of pupil instruction, the department shall pay the district state aid in that proportion of 1/180 that the actual percent of attendance bears to 75%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If a district adds 1 or more days of pupil instruction to the end of its instructional calendar for a school year to comply with subdivision (a) because the district otherwise would fail to provide the required minimum number of days of pupil instruction even after the operation of subsection (4) due to conditions not within the control of school authorities, then subdivision (d) does not apply for any day of pupil instruction that is added to the end of the instructional calendar. Instead, for any of those days, if the district does not have at least 60% of the district's membership in attendance on that day, the department shall pay the district state aid in that proportion of 1/180 that the actual percentage of attendance bears to 60%. For any day of pupil instruction added to the instructional calendar as described in this subdivision, the district shall report to the department the percentage of the district's membership that is in attendance, in the form and manner prescribed by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) At the request of a district that operates a department-approved alternative education program and that does not provide instruction for pupils in all of grades K to 12, the superintendent shall grant a waiver from the requirements of subdivision (d). The waiver must provide that an eligible district is subject to the proration provisions of subdivision (d) only if the district does not have at least 50% of the district's membership in attendance on any day of pupil instruction. In order to be eligible for this waiver, a district must maintain records to substantiate its compliance with the following requirements:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The district offers the minimum hours of pupil instruction as required under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) For each enrolled pupil, the district uses appropriate academic assessments to develop an individual education plan that leads to a high school diploma.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The district tests each pupil to determine academic progress at regular intervals and records the results of those tests in that pupil's individual education plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) All of the following apply to a waiver granted under subdivision (f):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the waiver is for a blended model of delivery, a waiver that is granted for the 2011-2012 fiscal year or a subsequent fiscal year remains in effect unless it is revoked by the superintendent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the waiver is for a 100% online model of delivery and the educational program for which the waiver is granted makes educational services available to pupils for a minimum of at least 1,098 hours during a school year and ensures that each pupil participates in the educational program for at least 1,098 hours during a school year, a waiver that is granted for the 2011-2012 fiscal year or a subsequent fiscal year remains in effect unless it is revoked by the superintendent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) A waiver that is not a waiver described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) is valid for 3 fiscal years, unless it is revoked by the superintendent, and must be renewed at the end of the 3-year period to remain in effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The superintendent shall promulgate rules for the implementation of this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) All of the following apply to the counting of days and hours of pupil instruction under this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the first 6 days or the equivalent number of hours for which pupil instruction is not provided because of conditions not within the control of school authorities, such as severe storms, fires, epidemics, utility power unavailability, water or sewer failure, or health conditions as defined by the city, county, or state health authorities, are counted as hours and days of pupil instruction. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) With the approval of the superintendent of public instruction, the department shall count as hours and days of pupil instruction for a fiscal year not more than 3 additional days or the equivalent number of additional hours for which pupil instruction is not provided in a district due to unusual and extenuating occurrences resulting from conditions not within the control of school authorities such as those conditions described in this subsection. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A district that counts hours or days of professional development for teachers as hours or days of pupil instruction, as provided under subsection (10), is eligible to have additional hours or days counted as hours and days of pupil instruction as provided under subdivision (b) to the same extent as a district that does not count hours or days of professional development for teachers as hours or days of pupil instruction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) In deciding whether or not to approve the counting of additional hours or days of pupil instruction under subdivision (b) for a district, the superintendent of public instruction shall not take into account whether or not the district counts hours or days of professional development for teachers as hours or days of pupil instruction, as provided under subsection (10).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Subsequent hours or days beyond those described in subdivisions (a) and (b) are not counted as hours or days of pupil instruction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A district does not forfeit part of its state aid appropriation because it adopts or has in existence an alternative scheduling program for pupils in kindergarten if the program provides at least the number of hours required under subsection (3) for a full-time equated membership for a pupil in kindergarten as provided under section 6(4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) In addition to any other penalty or forfeiture under this section, if at any time the department determines that 1 or more of the following have occurred in a district, the district forfeits in the current fiscal year beginning in the next payment to be calculated by the department a proportion of the funds due to the district under this article that is equal to the proportion below the required minimum number of hours and days of pupil instruction under subsection (3), as specified in the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The district fails to operate its schools for at least the required minimum number of hours and days of pupil instruction under subsection (3) in a school year, including hours and days counted under subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The board of the district takes formal action not to operate its schools for at least the required minimum number of hours and days of pupil instruction under subsection (3) in a school year, including hours and days counted under subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) In providing the minimum number of hours and days of pupil instruction required under subsection (3), a district shall use the following guidelines, and a district shall maintain records to substantiate its compliance with the following guidelines:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a pupil must be scheduled for at least the required minimum number of hours of instruction, excluding study halls, or at least the sum of 90 hours plus the required minimum number of hours of instruction, including up to 2 study halls.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The time a pupil is assigned to any tutorial activity in a block schedule may be considered instructional time, unless that time is determined in an audit to be a study hall period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, a pupil in grades 9 to 12 for whom a reduced schedule is determined to be in the individual pupil's best educational interest must be scheduled for a number of hours equal to at least 80% of the required minimum number of hours of pupil instruction to be considered a full-time equivalent pupil. A pupil in grades 9 to 12 who is scheduled in a 4-block schedule may receive a reduced schedule under this subsection if the pupil is scheduled for a number of hours equal to at least 75% of the required minimum number of hours of pupil instruction to be considered a full-time equivalent pupil.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If a pupil in grades 9 to 12 who is enrolled in a cooperative education program or a special education pupil cannot receive the required minimum number of hours of pupil instruction solely because of travel time between instructional sites during the school day, that travel time, up to a maximum of 3 hours per school week, is considered to be pupil instruction time for the purpose of determining whether the pupil is receiving the required minimum number of hours of pupil instruction. However, if a district demonstrates to the satisfaction of the department that the travel time limitation under this subdivision would create undue costs or hardship to the district, the department may consider more travel time to be pupil instruction time for this purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) In grades 7 through 12, instructional time that is part of a Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) program is considered to be pupil instruction time regardless of whether the instructor is a certificated teacher if all of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The instructor has met all of the requirements established by the United States Department of Defense and the applicable branch of the armed services for serving as an instructor in the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The board of the district or intermediate district employing or assigning the instructor complies with the requirements of sections 1230 and 1230a of the revised school code, MCL 380.1230 and 380.1230a, with respect to the instructor to the same extent as if employing the instructor as a regular classroom teacher.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (11) and (12), the department shall apply the guidelines under subsection (7) in calculating the full-time equivalency of pupils.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Upon application by the district for a particular fiscal year, the superintendent shall waive for a district the minimum number of hours and days of pupil instruction requirement of subsection (3) for a department-approved alternative education program or another innovative program approved by the department, including a 4-day school week. If a district applies for and receives a waiver under this subsection and complies with the terms of the waiver, the district is not subject to forfeiture under this section for the specific program covered by the waiver. If the district does not comply with the terms of the waiver, the amount of the forfeiture is calculated based upon a comparison of the number of hours and days of pupil instruction actually provided to the minimum number of hours and days of pupil instruction required under subsection (3). A district shall report pupils enrolled in a department-approved alternative education program under this subsection to the center in a form and manner determined by the center. All of the following apply to a waiver granted under this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the waiver is for a blended model of delivery, a waiver that is granted for the 2011-2012 fiscal year or a subsequent fiscal year remains in effect unless it is revoked by the superintendent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the waiver is for a 100% online model of delivery and the educational program for which the waiver is granted makes educational services available to pupils for a minimum of at least 1,098 hours during a school year and ensures that each pupil is on track for course completion at proficiency level, a waiver that is granted for the 2011-2012 fiscal year or a subsequent fiscal year remains in effect unless it is revoked by the superintendent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A waiver that is not a waiver described in subdivision (a) or (b) is valid for 3 fiscal years, unless it is revoked by the superintendent, and must be renewed at the end of the 3-year period to remain in effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A district may count up to 38 hours of professional development for teachers as hours of pupil instruction. All of the following apply to the counting of professional development as pupil instruction under this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the professional development exceeds 5 hours in a single day, that day may be counted as a day of pupil instruction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) At least 8 hours of the professional development counted as hours of pupil instruction under this subsection must be recommended by a districtwide professional development advisory committee appointed by the district board. The advisory committee must be composed of teachers employed by the district who represent a variety of grades and subject matter specializations, including special education; nonteaching staff; parents; and administrators. The majority membership of the committee must be composed of teaching staff.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Professional development provided online is allowable and encouraged, as long as the instruction has been approved by the district. The department shall issue a list of approved online professional development providers that must include the Michigan Virtual School.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Professional development may only be counted as hours of pupil instruction under this subsection for the pupils of those teachers scheduled to participate in the professional development.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The professional development must meet all of the following to be counted as pupil instruction under this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Be aligned to the school or district improvement plan for the school or district in which the professional development is being provided.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Be linked to 1 or more criteria in the evaluation tool developed or adopted by the district or intermediate district under section 1249 of the revised school code, MCL 380.1249.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Has been approved by the department as counting for state continuing education clock hours. The number of hours of professional development counted as hours of pupil instruction under this subsection may not exceed the number of state continuing education clock hours for which the professional development was approved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Not more than a combined total of 10 hours of the professional development takes place before the first scheduled day of school for the school year ending in the fiscal year and after the last scheduled day of school for that school year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Not more than 10 hours of the professional development takes place in a single month.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) At least 75% of teachers scheduled to participate in the professional development are in attendance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Subsections (3) and (8) do not apply to a school of excellence that is a cyber school, as that term is defined in section 551 of the revised school code, MCL 380.551, and is in compliance with section 553a of the revised school code, MCL 380.553a. Beginning July 1, 2021, this subsection is subject to section 8c. It is the intent of the legislature that the immediately preceding sentence apply retroactively and is effective July 1, 2021.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Subsections (3) and (8) do not apply to eligible pupils enrolled in a dropout recovery program that meets the requirements of section 23a. As used in this subsection, "eligible pupil" means that term as defined in section 23a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) At least every 2 years the superintendent shall review the waiver standards set forth in the pupil accounting and auditing manuals to ensure that the waiver standards and waiver process continue to be appropriate and responsive to changing trends in online learning. The superintendent shall solicit and consider input from stakeholders as part of this review.</div>

This may include 1 or more writing components. In selecting assessment instruments to fulfill the requirements of this subdivision, the department may consider the degree to which those assessment instruments are aligned to this state's content standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) One or more tests from 1 or more test developers that assess a pupil's ability to apply at least reading and mathematics skills in a manner that is intended to allow employers to use the results in making employment decisions. The department of technology, management, and budget and the superintendent shall ensure that any test or tests selected under this subdivision have all the components necessary to allow a pupil to be eligible to receive the results of a nationally recognized evaluation of workforce readiness if the pupil's test performance is adequate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A social studies component.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Any other component that is necessary to obtain the approval of the United States Department of Education to use the Michigan merit examination for the purposes of the no child left behind act of 2001, Public Law 107-110, or the every student succeeds act, Public Law 114-95.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In addition to all other requirements of this section, all of the following apply to the Michigan merit examination:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The department of technology, management, and budget and the superintendent shall ensure that any contractor used for scoring the Michigan merit examination supplies an individual report for each pupil that will identify for the pupil's parents and teachers whether the pupil met expectations or failed to meet expectations for each standard, to allow the pupil's parents and teachers to assess and remedy problems before the pupil moves to the next grade.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The department of technology, management, and budget and the superintendent shall ensure that any contractor used for scoring, developing, or processing the Michigan merit examination meets quality management standards commonly used in the assessment industry, including at least meeting level 2 of the capability maturity model developed by the Software Engineering Institute of Carnegie Mellon University for the first year the Michigan merit examination is offered to all grade 11 pupils and at least meeting level 3 of the capability maturity model for subsequent years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The department of technology, management, and budget and the superintendent shall ensure that any contract for scoring, administering, or developing the Michigan merit examination includes specific deadlines for all steps of the assessment process, including, but not limited to, deadlines for the correct testing materials to be supplied to schools and for the correct results to be returned to schools, and includes penalties for noncompliance with these deadlines.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The superintendent shall ensure that the Michigan merit examination meets all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Is designed to test pupils on this state's content standards in all subjects tested.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Complies with requirements of the no child left behind act of 2001, Public Law 107-110 or the every student succeeds act, Public Law 114-95.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Is consistent with the code of fair testing practices in education prepared by the Joint Committee on Testing Practices of the American Psychological Association.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Is factually accurate. If the superintendent determines that a question is not factually accurate and should be excluded from scoring, the state board and the superintendent shall ensure that the question is excluded from scoring.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A district shall include on each pupil's high school transcript all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For each high school graduate who has completed the Michigan merit examination under this section, the pupil's scaled score on each subject area component of the Michigan merit examination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The number of school days the pupil was in attendance at school each school year during high school and the total number of school days in session for each of those school years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The superintendent shall work with the provider or providers of the Michigan merit examination to produce Michigan merit examination subject area scores for each pupil participating in the Michigan merit examination. To the extent that the department determines that additional test items beyond those included in the college entrance component of the Michigan merit examination are required in a particular subject area, the department shall ensure that all test items in that subject area are scaled and merged for the purposes of producing a Michigan merit examination subject area score. The superintendent shall design and distribute to districts, intermediate districts, and nonpublic schools a simple and concise document that describes the scoring for each subject area and indicates the scaled score ranges for each subject area.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The Michigan merit examination shall be administered in each district during the last 12 weeks of the district's school year. The superintendent shall ensure that the Michigan merit examination is scored and the scores are returned to pupils, their parents or legal guardians, and districts not later than the beginning of the pupil's first semester of grade 12. The returned scores shall indicate at least the pupil's scaled score for each subject area component and the range of scaled scores for each subject area. In reporting the scores to pupils, parents, and schools, the superintendent shall provide standards-specific, meaningful, and timely feedback on the pupil's performance on the Michigan merit examination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A district shall administer the complete Michigan merit examination to a pupil only once and shall not administer the complete Michigan merit examination to the same pupil more than once. If a pupil does not take the complete Michigan merit examination in grade 11, the district shall administer the complete Michigan merit examination to the pupil in grade 12. If a pupil chooses to retake the college entrance examination component of the Michigan merit examination, as described in subsection (2)(a), the pupil may do so through the provider of the college entrance examination component and the cost of the retake is the responsibility of the pupil unless all of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The pupil has taken the complete Michigan merit examination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The pupil meets the income eligibility criteria for free breakfast, lunch, or milk, as determined under the Richard B. Russell national school lunch act, 42 USC 1751 to 1769i.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The pupil has applied to the provider of the college entrance examination component for a scholarship or fee waiver to cover the cost of the retake and that application has been denied.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) After taking the complete Michigan merit examination, the pupil has not already received a free retake of the college entrance examination component paid for either by this state or through a scholarship or fee waiver by the provider.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The superintendent shall ensure that the length of the Michigan merit examination and the combined total time necessary to administer all of the components of the Michigan merit examination are the shortest possible that will still maintain the degree of reliability and validity of the Michigan merit examination results determined necessary by the superintendent. The superintendent shall ensure that the maximum total combined length of time that schools are required to set aside for pupils to answer all test questions on the Michigan merit examination does not exceed 8 hours if the superintendent determines that sufficient alignment to applicable Michigan merit curriculum content standards can be achieved within that time limit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A district shall provide accommodations to a pupil with disabilities for the Michigan merit examination, as provided under section 504 of title V of the rehabilitation act of 1973, 29 USC 794; subtitle A of title II of the Americans with disabilities act of 1990, 42 USC 12131 to 12134; the individuals with disabilities education act amendments of 1997, Public Law 105-17; and the implementing regulations for those statutes. The provider or providers of the Michigan merit examination and the superintendent shall mutually agree upon the accommodations to be provided under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) To the greatest extent possible, the Michigan merit examination shall be based on this state's content standards, as appropriate. Annually, after each administration of the Michigan merit examination, the department shall provide a report of the points per standard so that teachers will know what content will be covered within the Michigan merit examination. The department may augment the college entrance and work skills components of the Michigan merit examination to develop the assessment, depending on the alignment of those components to this state's content standards. If these components do not align to these standards, the department shall produce additional components as required by law, while minimizing the amount of time needed for assessments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A child who is a student in a nonpublic school or home school may take the Michigan merit examination under this section. To take the Michigan merit examination, a child who is a student in a home school shall contact the district in which the child resides, and that district shall administer the Michigan merit examination, or the child may take the Michigan merit examination at a nonpublic school if allowed by the nonpublic school. Upon request from a nonpublic school, the superintendent shall direct the provider or providers to supply the Michigan merit examination to the nonpublic school and the nonpublic school may administer the Michigan merit examination. If a district administers the Michigan merit examination under this subsection to a child who is not enrolled in the district, the scores for that child are not considered for any purpose to be scores of a pupil of the district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) In contracting under subsection (2), the department of technology, management, and budget shall consider a contractor that provides electronically-scored essays with the ability to score constructed response feedback in multiple languages and provide ongoing instruction and feedback.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The purpose of the Michigan merit examination is to assess pupil performance in mathematics, science, social studies, and English language arts for the purpose of improving academic achievement and establishing a statewide standard of competency. The assessment under this section provides a common measure of data that will contribute to the improvement of Michigan schools' curriculum and instruction by encouraging alignment with Michigan's curriculum framework standards and promotes pupil participation in higher level mathematics, science, social studies, and English language arts courses. These standards are based upon the expectations of what pupils should learn through high school and are aligned with national standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) For a pupil enrolled in a middle college program, other than a middle college operated as a shared educational entity or a specialized shared educational entity, if the pupil receives at least 50% of his or her instruction at the high school while in grade 11, the Michigan merit examination shall be administered to the pupil at the high school at which the pupil receives high school instruction, and the department shall include the pupil's scores on the Michigan merit examination in the scores for that high school for all purposes for which a school's or district's results are reported. The department shall allow the middle college program to use a 5-year graduation rate for determining adequate yearly progress. As used in this subsection, "middle college" means a program consisting of a series of courses and other requirements and conditions, including an early college or other program created under a memorandum of understanding, that allows a pupil to graduate from high school with both a high school diploma and a certificate or degree from a community college or state public university.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "English language arts" means reading and writing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Social studies" means United States history, world history, world geography, economics, and American government.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) For each report made by the department that includes the statewide assessment results for a school building, the department shall include the scores for the statewide assessment and the graduation rate for consortium pupils with the scores for the school building in the participating district in which the consortium pupil is enrolled or would otherwise attend. The statewide assessment for a consortium pupil may be administered either at the consortium location or at the school building in the participating district in which the consortium pupil is enrolled or would otherwise attend. For the purposes of this subsection, a consortium pupil is a pupil who is enrolled or participating in a participating district in a school or program operated as a consortium or under a cooperative arrangement formed by 2 or more districts or intermediate districts, including, but not limited to, a consortium or cooperative arrangement operated as a program, a shared educational entity, a specialized educational entity, or a special education center program.</div>

It assumes the invalid creation of a continuing appropriation. Therefore, the following sections of the school aid act and their associated allocations must be considered inoperative: 24, 55, 74, 75, 105a, 111, and 116. These sections will be treated as excluded from the current bill... .”</p>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the nonpublic school has submitted a written request to the district in which the nonpublic school is located for the district to provide certain instruction under this subsection for a school year and the district does not agree to provide some or all of that instruction by May 1 immediately preceding that school year or, if the request is submitted after March 1 immediately preceding that school year, within 60 days after the nonpublic school submits the request, the instruction is instead provided by an eligible other district. This subparagraph does not require a nonpublic school to submit more than 1 request to the district in which the nonpublic school is located for that district to provide instruction under this subsection, and does not require a nonpublic school to submit an additional request to the district in which the nonpublic school is located for that district to provide additional instruction under this subsection beyond the instruction requested in the original request, before having the instruction provided by an eligible other district. A public school academy that is located in the district in which the nonpublic school is located or in an eligible other district also may provide instruction under this subparagraph under the same conditions as an eligible other district. As used in this subparagraph, "eligible other district" means a district that is located in the same intermediate district as the district in which the nonpublic school is located or is located in an intermediate district that is contiguous to that intermediate district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The nonpublic school is registered with the department as a nonpublic school and meets all state reporting requirements for nonpublic schools.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The curricular offering is restricted to nonessential elective courses for pupils in grades kindergarten to 12.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The district ensures that all individuals that have contact with pupils as part of a course provided to pupils enrolled in the district under section 166b and counted in membership under section 6 have not been convicted of sexual misconduct.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The district ensures that an individual who provides direct or indirect curricular offerings to pupils as part of an optional or required course provided to pupils enrolled in the district under section 166b and counted in membership under section 6, or who has unsupervised contact with pupils as part of such a course, is subject to the requirements under sections 1230, 1230a, 1230b, 1230c, 1230d, 1230e, and 1230g of the revised school code, MCL 380.1230, 380.1230a, 380.1230b, 380.1230c, 380.1230d, 380.1230e, and 380.1230g, as if the individual is offered full-time or part-time employment in the district, is an employee of the district, or is assigned to regularly and continuously work under contract in any of its schools, as applicable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The district ensures that each optional experience associated with a course provided to pupils enrolled in the district under section 166b and counted in membership under section 6 is offered on a schedule that ensures that the experience is available to the majority of full-time pupils in membership in the district in the same grade level or age group as pupils participating in the course and enrolled in the district under section 166b.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The district provides the department information necessary to quantify all of the following, in a form and manner prescribed by the department in conjunction with the center:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A complete listing of all courses provided to pupils counted in membership in the district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Course enrollments by each participant using local coding and the school codes for the exchange of data (SCED).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Identification of each course teacher or mentor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A nonessential course in grades 1 to 8 is a course other than a mathematics, science, social studies, and English language arts course required by the district for grade progression. Nonessential courses in grades 9 to 12 are those other than algebra 1, algebra 2, English 9-12, geometry, biology, chemistry, physics, economics, geography, American history, world history, the Constitution, government, and civics, or courses that fulfill the same credit requirement as these courses. Nonessential elective courses include courses offered by the local district for high school credit that are also capable of generating postsecondary credit, including, at least, advanced placement and international baccalaureate courses. College level courses taken by high school students for college credit are nonessential courses. Remedial courses for any grade in the above-listed essential courses are considered essential. Kindergarten is considered nonessential.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Subject to section 6(4)(ii), a minor enrolled as described in this section is a part-time pupil for purposes of state school aid under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A district that receives a written request to provide instruction under subsection (2) shall reply to the request in writing by May 1 immediately preceding the applicable school year or, if the request is made after March 1 immediately preceding that school year, within 60 days after the nonpublic school submits the request. The written reply shall specify whether the district agrees to provide or does not agree to provide the instruction for each portion of instruction included in the request.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Each community college that receives an appropriation in section 201 shall report to the center by the last business day of August of each year the tuition and mandatory fees paid by a full-time in-district student and a full-time out-of-district student as established by the community college governing board for the current academic year. This report should also include the annual cost of tuition and fees based on a full-time course load of 30 credits. This report must also specify the amount that tuition and fees have increased for the community college from the prior academic year. Each community college shall also report any revisions to the reported current academic year tuition and mandatory fees adopted by the community college governing board to the center within 15 days of being adopted. The center shall provide this information and any revisions to the house and senate fiscal agencies and the state budget director.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Each community college that receives an appropriation in section 201 shall certify to the state budget director by the last business day of August that its board will not adopt an increase in tuition and fee rates for in-district students for the 2023-2024 academic year that is greater than 4.5% or $205.00, whichever is greater. As used in this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Fee" means any board-authorized fee that will be paid by more than 1/2 of all in-district students at least once during their enrollment at a community college. A community college increasing a fee that applies to a specific subset of students or courses shall provide sufficient information to prove that the increase applied to that subset will not cause the increase in the average amount of board-authorized total tuition and fees paid by in-district students in the 2023-2024 academic year to exceed the limit established in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Tuition and fee rate" means the average of full-time rates paid by a majority of students in each class, based on an unweighted average of the rates authorized by the community college board and actually charged to students, deducting any uniformly rebated or refunded amounts, for the 2 semesters with the highest levels of full-time equated in-district enrollment during the academic year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Community colleges that exceed the tuition and fee rate cap described in subsection (2) are not eligible to receive payments under section 201 for performance funding for fiscal year 2023-2024.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the legislature may at any time adjust appropriations for a community college that adopts an increase in tuition and fee rates for in-district students that exceeds the rate cap established in subsection (2).</div>

If a calculation under this section results in an amount less than $0.00, the payment under this section is equal to $0.00. It is intended that each public university will reach a minimum funding level of at least $4,500.00. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Whether the credits were earned in a dual enrollment program that counted the credits toward high school graduation requirements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Whether the credits were earned in a course that was delivered in a high school classroom, community college classroom or campus, or another location.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The state budget director shall implement uniform reporting requirements to ensure that a public university receiving a payment under section 236 for operations increase or per-student floor funding has satisfied the tuition restraint requirements of this section. The state budget director has the sole authority to determine if a public university has met the requirements of this section. Information reported by a public university to the state budget director under this subsection must also be reported to the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on higher education and the house and senate fiscal agencies.</div>

It is the intent of the legislature that the utilization of a student aid index instead of expected family contribution does not adversely impact the eligibility of students with multiple members of the student's household or the student's parents' household in college.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) For the purpose of determining eligibility under subdivision (g), an individual is considered to have met the requirements of subdivision (g) if the individual received the Michigan achievement scholarship in academic year 2023-2024, was determined to have an expected family contribution of $25,000.00 or less in academic year 2023-2024, and has completed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid for the subsequent award cycles.</div>

Any increase in the award must be proportional for all eligible students receiving awards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Veterans Administration benefits must not be considered in determining eligibility for the award of scholarships under 1964 PA 208, MCL 390.971 to 390.981.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the maximum amount appropriated under this act from the state school aid fund for a fiscal year exceeds the amount necessary to fully fund allocations under this act from the state school aid fund, that excess amount must not be expended in that state fiscal year and does not lapse to the general fund, but instead is deposited into the school aid stabilization fund created in section 11a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the total maximum amount appropriated under all articles of this act from the state school aid fund and the school aid stabilization fund exceeds the amount available for expenditure from the state school aid fund for that fiscal year, payments under sections 11j, 11m, 22a, 26a, 26b, 26c, 31d, 31f, 51a(2), 51a(11), 51c, 53a, 56, 147c, 147e(2)(a), and 152a must be made in full. In addition, for districts beginning operations after 1994-95 that qualify for payments under section 22b, payments under section 22b must be made so that the qualifying districts receive the lesser of an amount equal to the 1994-95 foundation allowance of the district in which the district beginning operations after 1994-95 is located or $5,500.00. The amount of the payment to be made under section 22b for these qualifying districts must be as calculated under section 22a, with the balance of the payment under section 22b being subject to the proration otherwise provided under this subsection and subsection (3). If proration is necessary, state payments under each of the other sections of article I from all state funding sources, and state appropriations to community colleges and public universities under articles II and III from the state school aid fund, must be prorated in the manner prescribed in subsection (3) as necessary to reflect the amount available for expenditure from the state school aid fund for the affected fiscal year. However, if the department of treasury determines that proration will be required under this subsection, or if the department of treasury determines that further proration is required under this subsection after an initial proration has already been made for a fiscal year, the department of treasury shall notify the state budget director, and the state budget director shall notify the legislature at least 30 calendar days or 6 legislative session days, whichever is more, before the department reduces any payments under this act because of the proration. During the 30-calendar-day or 6-legislative-session-day period after that notification by the state budget director, the department shall not reduce any payments under this act because of proration under this subsection. The legislature may prevent proration from occurring by, within the 30-calendar-day or 6-legislative-session-day period after that notification by the state budget director, enacting legislation appropriating additional funds from the general fund, countercyclical budget and economic stabilization fund, state school aid fund balance, or another source to fund the amount of the projected shortfall.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If proration is necessary under subsection (2), the department shall calculate the proration in district and intermediate district payments under article I that is required under subsection (2), and the department of treasury shall calculate the proration in community college and public university payments under articles II and III that is required under subsection (2), as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The department and the department of treasury shall calculate the percentage of total state school aid fund money that is appropriated and allocated under this act for the affected fiscal year for each of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Districts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Intermediate districts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Entities receiving funding from the state school aid fund under article I other than districts or intermediate districts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Community colleges and public universities that receive funding from the state school aid fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Subject to subsection (4), the department shall recover a percentage of the proration amount required under subsection (2) that is equal to the percentage calculated under subdivision (a)(i) for districts by reducing payments to districts. This reduction must be made by calculating an equal dollar amount per pupil as necessary to recover this percentage of the proration amount and reducing each district's total state school aid from state sources, other than payments under sections 11j, 11m, 22a, 26a, 26b, 26c, 31d, 31f, 51a(2), 51a(11), 51c, 53a, 147c, 147e(2)(a), and 152a, by that amount.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Subject to subsection (4), the department shall recover a percentage of the proration amount required under subsection (2) that is equal to the percentage calculated under subdivision (a)(ii) for intermediate districts by reducing payments to intermediate districts. This reduction must be made by reducing the payments to each intermediate district, other than payments under sections 26a, 26b, 26c, 51a(2), 51a(11), 53a, 56, 147c, 147e(2)(a), and 152a, on an equal percentage basis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Subject to subsection (4), the department shall recover a percentage of the proration amount required under subsection (2) that is equal to the percentage calculated under subdivision (a)(iii) for entities receiving funding from the state school aid fund under article I other than districts and intermediate districts by reducing payments to these entities. This reduction must be made by reducing the payments to each of these entities, other than payments under sections 11j, 11m, 26a, 26b, and 26c on an equal percentage basis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The department of treasury shall recover a percentage of the proration amount required under subsection (2) that is equal to the percentage calculated under subdivision (a)(iv) for community colleges and public universities that receive funding from the state school aid fund by reducing that portion of the payments under articles II and III to these community colleges and public universities, other than payments under sections 201(5) and 236(4), that is from the state school aid fund on an equal percentage basis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a deposit from the school aid countercyclical budget and foundation stabilization fund is made into the state school aid fund for the purposes of eliminating or reducing proration, as provided in section 11z, the amount deposited into the state school aid fund must be used to reduce or eliminate the amount recovered from districts under subsection (3)(b), intermediate districts under subsection (3)(c), and entities receiving funding from the state school aid fund under article I other than districts and intermediate districts under subsection (3)(d). For the purposes of calculations under this subsection, the department shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Calculate the percentage of total state school aid fund money that is appropriated and allocated under this act for the affected fiscal year for each of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Districts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Intermediate districts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Entities receiving funding from the state school aid fund under article I other than districts or intermediate districts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Multiply the resulting percentages calculated under subdivision (a) by the amount deposited from the school aid countercyclical budget and foundation stabilization fund into the state school aid fund to determine how much proration has been reduced or eliminated for districts, intermediate districts, and entities receiving funding from the state school aid fund under article I other than districts or intermediate districts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Credit the resulting amounts calculated under subdivision (b) toward the total dollar amount necessary for recovery described in subsections (3)(b), (3)(c), and (3)(d), as applicable.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Upon request by the eligible student, the school district or state approved nonpublic school in which an eligible student is enrolled shall provide to the eligible student a letter signed by the student's principal indicating the student's eligibility under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An eligible student may apply to a career and technical preparation program to enroll in 1 or more eligible courses offered by that career and technical preparation program and, if accepted, may enroll in 1 or more of those courses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For an eligible student enrolled in a school district, within a reasonable time after registration, the career and technical preparation program shall send written notice to the eligible student and his or her school district. For an eligible student enrolled in a state approved nonpublic school, within a reasonable time after registration, the career and technical preparation program shall send written notice to the eligible student and his or her state approved nonpublic school and to the department. The notice must indicate the course or courses and hours of enrollment of that eligible student. The career and technical preparation program shall notify the eligible student about tuition, fees, books, materials, and other related charges, as determined by the career and technical preparation program, in the customary manner used by the career and technical preparation program, and shall notify the eligible student of the estimated amount of the eligible charges that will be billed to the school district or department, as applicable, under subsection (4).</div>

In determining the proportion of the school year that an eligible student attends a career and technical preparation program under this subsection, a school district shall take into account, according to guidelines published by the department under subsection (16), an eligible student's attendance at a career and technical preparation program for an eligible course that occurs in whole or in part when the school district is not in session during the summer immediately following that regularly scheduled school year. However, in the calculation of the statewide pupil-weighted average foundation allowance for the purposes of this subsection, if a school district's foundation allowance is above the target foundation allowance under section 20 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1620, then the school district's foundation allowance must be considered to be the target foundation allowance.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For an eligible student who is enrolled in a state approved nonpublic school, upon receiving from the department under subsection (4) the amount of the eligible charges to be paid on behalf of the eligible student, the department of treasury shall cause to be paid to the career and technical preparation program on behalf of the eligible student an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of the eligible charges or the prorated percentage of the statewide pupil-weighted average foundation allowance, as calculated under this subsection and section 20 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1620, for all school districts for the state fiscal year that begins on October 1 immediately preceding the academic year of enrollment in the career and technical preparation program, with the proration based on the proportion of the school year that the eligible student attends the career and technical preparation program. In determining the proportion of the school year that an eligible student attends a career and technical preparation program under this subsection, the department shall take into account, according to guidelines published by the department under subsection (16), an eligible student's attendance at a career and technical preparation program for an eligible course that occurs in whole or in part when the state approved nonpublic school is not in session during the summer immediately following that regularly scheduled school year. However, in the calculation of the statewide pupil-weighted average foundation allowance for the purposes of this subsection, if a school district's foundation allowance is above the target foundation allowance under section 20 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1620, then the school district's foundation allowance must be considered to be the target foundation allowance. Not later than September 1 of each year, the department shall notify the department of treasury of the amount of the statewide pupil-weighted average foundation allowance as calculated for the purposes of this subsection. The eligible student is responsible for payment of the remainder of the costs associated with his or her enrollment in the career and technical preparation program that exceed the amount the department of treasury is required to pay under this act and that are not paid by the department of treasury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A career and technical preparation program shall not charge a late fee to an eligible student, a school district, the department, or the department of treasury for a payment that is made in compliance with the timetable prescribed under this act even if the payment would otherwise be considered late by the career and technical preparation program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A school district, state approved nonpublic school, or the department may require an eligible student to provide, on a form supplied by the school district, state approved nonpublic school, or the department, reasonable verification that the eligible student is regularly attending a career and technical preparation course under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) For an eligible student who is enrolled in a school district and who enrolls in an eligible course under this act, if the eligible student does not complete the eligible course, and if the school district has paid money for the course or, if the eligible student enrolls in an eligible course for postsecondary credit only and the eligible student does not successfully complete the eligible course, as determined by the career and technical preparation program, on behalf of the student, both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The career and technical preparation program shall forward to the school district any funds that are refundable due to noncompletion of the course. If applicable, the school district shall then forward to the eligible student any refunded money in excess of the amount paid by the school district for the course on behalf of the student.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The eligible student shall repay to the school district any funds that were expended by the school district for the course that are not refunded to the school district by the career and technical preparation program. If the eligible student does not repay this money, the school district may impose sanctions against the eligible student as determined by school district policy. This subdivision does not apply to an eligible student who does not complete the course due to a family or medical emergency, as determined by the career and technical preparation program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) For an eligible student who is enrolled in a state approved nonpublic school and who enrolls in an eligible course under this act, if the eligible student does not complete the eligible course or, if the eligible student enrolls in an eligible course for postsecondary credit only and the eligible student does not successfully complete the eligible course, as determined by the career and technical preparation program, and if the department of treasury has paid money for the course on behalf of the eligible student, both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The career and technical preparation program shall forward to the department of treasury any funds that are refundable due to noncompletion of the course. If applicable, the career and technical preparation program shall then refund to the eligible student any funds that are refundable due to noncompletion of the course and are in excess of the amount paid by the department of treasury for the course on behalf of the eligible student.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The eligible student shall repay to the department of treasury any funds that were expended by the department of treasury for the course that are not refunded to the department of treasury by the career and technical preparation program. This subdivision does not apply to an eligible student who does not complete the course due to a family or medical emergency, as determined by the career and technical preparation program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A school district, state approved nonpublic school, the department, or the department of treasury shall make available to an eligible student copies of all correspondence in the possession of the school district, state approved nonpublic school, department, or department of treasury regarding the eligible student's participation in a career and technical preparation course under this act. The school district, state approved nonpublic school, department, or department of treasury shall keep correspondence described in this subsection for at least 1 year.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) This section does not apply to any career and technical preparation courses in which an eligible student is enrolled in addition to being enrolled full-time in that eligible student's school district or state approved nonpublic school; to a career and technical preparation course an eligible student is retaking after failing to achieve a satisfactory grade; or to a course contrary to the eligibility provisions of this act. In determining full-time enrollment in a school district under this section or a school district's full-time equated membership under the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1601 to 388.1897l, for a pupil enrolled in a career and technical preparation program under this act, the pupil's enrollment in both the school district and the career and technical preparation program must be counted as enrollment in the school district and a pupil is not considered to be enrolled in a school district less than full-time solely because of the effect of the pupil's enrollment in 1 or more career and technical preparation courses under this act, including necessary travel time, on the number of class hours provided by the school district to the pupil. In determining full-time enrollment in a state approved nonpublic school under this section for a student enrolled in a career and technical preparation program under this act, the student's enrollment in both the state approved nonpublic school and the career and technical preparation program must be counted as enrollment in the state approved nonpublic school and a student is not considered to be enrolled in a state approved nonpublic school less than full-time solely because of the effect of the student's enrollment in 1 or more career and technical preparation courses under this act, including necessary travel time, on the number of class hours provided by the state approved nonpublic school to the student.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) This act does not require a school district or the department of treasury to pay or otherwise provide financial support for transportation or parking costs necessary for an eligible student to participate in a career and technical preparation program under this act. A school district, state approved nonpublic school, or this state is not liable for any injury incurred by an eligible student that is related to transportation necessary for the eligible student to participate in a career and technical preparation program under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) The legislature shall appropriate funds to the department of treasury for making payments required to be made by the department of treasury under this act.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Computed millage" means the number of mills in any year, not less than 7 mills and not more than 13 mills, determined on the date of issuance of the order qualifying the bonds or on a later date if requested by the school district and approved by the state treasurer, that, if levied by the school district, will generate sufficient annual proceeds to pay principal and interest on all the school district's qualified bonds plus principal and interest on all qualified loans related to those qualified bonds no later than the final mandatory repayment date. Based on changes of circumstances, including, but not limited to, additional bond qualification, refundings, changes in qualified loan interest rates, changes in taxable values, and assumptions contained in any then currently effective guidelines issued by the state treasurer pursuant to section 5(2)(c), the school district shall not less than annually, beginning on October 1, 2013, using methods prescribed in this act, recalculate the computed millage necessary to generate sufficient annual levy proceeds to pay principal and interest on all of the school district's qualified bonds and principal and interest on all qualified loans related to those qualified bonds not later than the final mandatory repayment date. If the school district determines that the recalculated computed millage is lower than its current millage levy rate, the school district shall promptly notify the state treasurer in writing of the recalculated computed millage. Immediately thereafter, the school district shall decrease its millage levy rate to the recalculated computed millage, but not below the computed millage established pursuant to the most recent order qualifying bonds, other than an order qualifying refunding bonds, for that school district, or to the minimum levy prescribed by law for receipt of qualified loans, whichever rate is higher. If the school district determines that the recalculated computed millage is higher than its current millage levy rate, the school district shall promptly notify the state treasurer in writing of the recalculated computed millage. Immediately thereafter, the school district shall increase its millage levy rate to the recalculated computed millage, subject to 1 of the following exceptions, and subject to any maximum millage levy rate otherwise prescribed for by law:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) For each school district's first recalculated computed millage required as of October 1, 2013, increase its millage levy by a percentage amount equal to the equivalent percentage of taxable value change for that school district over the immediately preceding 5 years, but not higher than the recalculated computed millage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) For each school district's subsequent recalculated computed millage beginning October 1, 2014 and each year thereafter, increase its millage levy by a percentage amount equal to the percentage of taxable value decline for the immediately preceding year ending September 30, but not to a rate higher than the recalculated computed millage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If it is determined that a district's current computed millage is sufficient to pay all qualified loans by the mandatory final loan repayment date, no recalculation of the computed millage is required. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Final mandatory repayment date" means the final mandatory repayment date determined by the state treasurer under section 9.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The school board of the school district has applied to the state treasurer for permission to levy less than the millage required to be levied to pay the principal and interest on its qualified bonds or qualified loans under subsection (1).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The waiver will be financially beneficial to this state, the school district, or both.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The board of the school district, by resolution, has agreed to comply with all conditions that the state treasurer considers necessary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) All qualified loans shall bear interest at 1 of the following rates:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The average annual cost of funds used to make qualified loans plus 0.125%, computed by the state treasurer not less often than annually. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A lesser rate determined by the state treasurer to be necessary to maintain the exemption from federal income tax of interest on any bonds or notes issued to fund qualified loans.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A higher rate determined by the state treasurer to be necessary to prevent the impairment of any contract of this state or the Michigan finance authority in existence on March 28, 2013.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A payment date determined under subsection (2) or a due date determined under subsection (3) is a final mandatory repayment date. Once established for a school district as provided in this section, a final mandatory repayment date shall apply to all qualified loans of the school district, whenever made, until 30 days after the date the school district has no outstanding qualified loans and no outstanding debt incurred to refund qualified loans. Notwithstanding this subsection, the state treasurer may determine a later mandatory repayment date for a school district that agrees to levy a higher millage, acceptable to the state treasurer, not to exceed 13 mills, than its existing computed millage.</div>
