A nonresident estate or trust may claim a credit against the tax imposed under this part in an amount equal to the nonresident estate's or trust's allocated share of the tax as reported to the nonresident estate or trust pursuant to section 839(1)(d) for the tax year ending on or within the taxpayer's same tax year multiplied by a percentage equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is 100 minus the rate imposed under section 51, and the denominator of which is 100.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) For a taxpayer that is an estate or trust, the amount of the credit allowed under this section shall be determined by multiplying the amount calculated under subsection (1) by a percentage equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is the flow-through entity business income tax base that is retained by the estate or trust and the denominator of which is the total flow-through entity business income tax base that is included in distributable net income.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For a taxpayer who is a beneficiary of an estate or trust that is either a member of a flow-through entity that elects to file a return and pay the tax imposed under part 4 or a direct or indirect member of another flow-through entity that elects to file a return and pay the tax imposed under part 4, the amount of the credit allowed under this section is equal to the allocable share of the tax imposed under part 4 for the year ending on or within the taxpayer's same tax year as reported to the beneficiary in accordance with section 839(2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the credit allowed under this section exceeds the tax liability of the taxpayer for the tax year, that portion of the credit that exceeds the tax liability shall be refunded.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) For tax years ending in 2021 only, if the taxpayer claims a credit under this section and the annual return filed under this part on which the credit under this section is claimed results in a refund, any portion of that refund that is attributable to the credit claimed under this section is not subject to added interest under section 30(3), (4), and (5) of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.30.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A qualified taxpayer with a rehabilitation plan certified after December 31, 1998 and before January 1, 2012 may credit against the tax imposed by this part the amount determined pursuant to subsection (2) for the qualified expenditures for the rehabilitation of a historic resource pursuant to the rehabilitation plan in the year in which the certification of completed rehabilitation of the historic resource is issued. Only those expenditures that are paid or incurred during the time periods prescribed for the credit under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code and any related treasury regulations shall be considered qualified expenditures.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The credit allowed under this section shall be 25% of the qualified expenditures that are eligible, or would have been eligible except that the taxpayer elected to transfer the credit under subsection (12), for the credit under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code if the taxpayer is eligible for the credit under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code or, if the taxpayer is not eligible for the credit under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code, 25% of the qualified expenditures that would qualify under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code except that the expenditures are made to a historic resource that is not eligible for the credit under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code, subject to both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A taxpayer with qualified expenditures that are eligible for the credit under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code may not claim a credit under this section for those qualified expenditures unless the taxpayer has claimed and received a credit for those qualified expenditures under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code or the taxpayer has elected to transfer the credit under subsection (12).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A credit under this section shall be reduced by the amount of a credit received by the taxpayer for the same qualified expenditures under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) To be eligible for the credit under this section, the taxpayer shall apply to and receive from the Michigan state housing development authority that the historic significance, the rehabilitation plan, and the completed rehabilitation of the historic resource meet the criteria under subsection (6) and either of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The taxpayer has received certification from the national park service that the historic resource's significance, the rehabilitation plan, and the completed rehabilitation qualify for the credit allowed under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a qualified taxpayer is eligible for the credit allowed under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code, the qualified taxpayer shall file for certification with the authority to qualify for the credit allowed under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code. If the qualified taxpayer has previously filed for certification with the authority to qualify for the credit allowed under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code, additional filing for the credit allowed under this section is not required.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The authority may inspect a historic resource at any time during the rehabilitation process and may revoke certification of completed rehabilitation if the rehabilitation was not undertaken as represented in the rehabilitation plan or if unapproved alterations to the completed rehabilitation are made during the 5 years after the tax year in which the credit was claimed. The authority shall promptly notify the department of a revocation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Qualified expenditures for the rehabilitation of a historic resource may be used to calculate the credit under this section if the historic resource meets 1 of the criteria listed in subdivision (a) and 1 of the criteria listed in subdivision (b):</div>

The amount of the refund shall be equal to 90% of the amount of the credit that exceeds the qualified taxpayer's tax liability. An election under this subsection shall be made in the year that a certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued and shall be irrevocable.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) For tax years beginning after December 31, 2008, if a certificate of completed rehabilitation is revoked under subsection (5) or if the historic resource is sold or disposed of less than 5 years after being placed in service as defined in section 47(b)(1) of the internal revenue code and related treasury regulations, the following percentage of the credit amount previously claimed relative to that historic resource shall be added back to the tax liability of the qualified taxpayer that received the certificate of completed rehabilitation and not the assignee in the year of the revocation:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the revocation is less than 1 year after the historic resource is placed in service, 100%.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to the limitations under this section, a qualified taxpayer with a certificate of completed rehabilitation issued pursuant to subsection (4) after December 31, 2020 and before January 1, 2031 may credit against the tax imposed by this part the amount determined pursuant to subsection (2) for the qualified expenditures for the rehabilitation of a historic resource pursuant to the rehabilitation plan in the year in which the certificate of completed rehabilitation of the historic resource is issued. The qualified taxpayer shall initially claim a credit under this section within 5 years after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued pursuant to subsection (4). If the credit is not initially claimed within 5 years after the certificate is issued, the certificate is no longer valid and the qualified taxpayer is no longer eligible to claim a credit under this section for that rehabilitation plan. Only those expenditures that are paid or incurred during the time periods prescribed for the credit under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code and any related treasury regulations shall be considered qualified expenditures.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to the limitations under this section, a qualified taxpayer that has claimed and received a credit for qualified expenditures under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code or has entered into an agreement under subsection (10) may claim a credit under this section equal to 25% of the qualified expenditures that are eligible, or would have been eligible except that the qualified taxpayer entered into an agreement under subsection (10), for the credit under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code or, if the qualified taxpayer is not eligible for the credit under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code, 25% of the qualified expenditures that would qualify under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code except that the expenditures are made to a historic resource that is not eligible for the credit under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) To be eligible for the credit under this section, a person shall submit an application and a rehabilitation plan to the state historic preservation office. Completed applications must be considered in the order in which the office received the completed applications and approved or denied within 120 days of receipt of the completed applications. If the office determines that the application is complete and the rehabilitation plan meets the criteria for a credit under this section, the office shall issue a preapproval letter to the applicant that states that the rehabilitation plan qualifies for the credit under this section and the maximum total amount of the credit reserved for which a credit may be claimed when the project is complete and a certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued for qualified expenditures pursuant to that rehabilitation plan. If an application is denied under this subsection, the applicant may file an appeal in a form and manner as prescribed by the office or subsequently reapply for the same rehabilitation plan or for another rehabilitation plan, or both. Subject to the limitations under this section, the total of all credits reserved under preapproval letters for rehabilitation plans approved under this section and section 676 shall not exceed $5,000,000.00 per calendar year. To the extent the office receives applications for the rehabilitation of small nonresidential historic resources for credits in excess of $2,000,000.00, not less than $2,000,000.00 of the $5,000,000.00 each calendar year shall be approved for small nonresidential historic resources. To the extent the office receives applications for the rehabilitation of large nonresidential historic resources for credits in excess of $2,000,000.00, not less than $2,000,000.00 of the $5,000,000.00 each calendar year shall be approved for large nonresidential historic resources. To the extent the office receives applications for the rehabilitation of residential historic resources for credits in excess of $1,000,000.00, not less than $1,000,000.00 of the $5,000,000.00 each calendar year shall be approved for residential historic resources. The office shall not issue a preapproval letter or certificate of completed rehabilitation that authorizes a qualified taxpayer to claim a credit of more than $2,000,000.00 in a single tax year for the same historic resource. If, for any calendar year, the office issues preapproval letters and reserves the maximum amount of tax credits allowed under this section for that calendar year, the office shall notify all applicants who have submitted completed applications and rehabilitation plans then awaiting approval or submitted for approval after the calculation is made that no additional preapproval letters for rehabilitation plans will be issued during that calendar year. The office shall also notify those applicants of the priority number given to the applicant's application and rehabilitation plan awaiting approval. The applications and plans will remain in priority status for 2 years from the date of the original application and plan and will be considered for approval and reservation of tax credits in the priority order established in this subsection in the event that additional credits become available resulting from the rescission of approvals under this subsection or subsection (5) and at the beginning of the next calendar year. An applicant that has received a preapproval letter shall commence rehabilitation, if it has not previously begun, within 1 year after the issuance of the preapproval letter and complete the rehabilitation plan within 8 years after the issuance of the preapproval letter or the office will rescind the preapproval letter and reallocate the amount of the credit reserved for that rehabilitation plan. Upon completion of a rehabilitation plan for which a preapproval letter was issued, the applicant shall submit to the office documentation that the rehabilitation is complete and the completed rehabilitation of the historic resource meets the criteria under subsection (6) and either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) All of the following criteria:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The historic resource contributes to the significance of the historic district in which it is located or is individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or state register of historic sites.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Both the rehabilitation plan and completed rehabilitation of the historic resource meet the federal secretary of the interior's standards for rehabilitation and guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings, 36 CFR part 67.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) All rehabilitation work has been done to or within the walls, boundaries, or structures of the historic resource or to historic resources located within the property boundaries of the resource.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The applicant has received certification from the national park service that the historic resource's significance, the rehabilitation plan, and the completed rehabilitation qualify for the credit allowed under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The office shall verify that the rehabilitation is complete and meets the criteria under subsection (3). However, if the applicant is eligible for the credit allowed under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code, additional documentation that the rehabilitation is complete for the credit allowed under this section is not required. Within 120 days after receiving verification, in a form and manner as prescribed by the office, that the rehabilitation is complete and meets the requirements of subsection (3), the office shall issue a certificate of completed rehabilitation to the applicant that states the rehabilitation plan submitted by the applicant has been completed, the amount of qualified expenditures, and the total amount of the credit allowed to be claimed by a qualified taxpayer under this section. If the amount of qualified expenditures incurred exceeds the amount of the tax credits reserved by the preapproval letter issued under subsection (3), the applicant may submit a request to the office, in a form and manner as prescribed by the office, for the issuance and approval of a certificate of completed rehabilitation in excess of the amount initially authorized in the preapproval letter. If the office determines that less than $5,000,000.00 has been reserved under preapproval letters issued for the calendar year, after priority has been given to those notified under subsection (3), then the office may issue a certificate of completed rehabilitation in excess of the amount included in the preapproval letter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The office may inspect a historic resource at any time during the rehabilitation process and may revoke the preapproval letter or the certificate of completed rehabilitation if the rehabilitation was not undertaken as represented in the rehabilitation plan or if unapproved alterations to the completed rehabilitation are made within 5 years after the tax year in which the certificate of completed rehabilitation was issued. The office shall promptly notify the department of a revocation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Qualified expenditures for the rehabilitation of a historic resource may be used to calculate the credit under this section if the historic resource is 1 of the following during the tax year in which a credit under this section is claimed for those qualified expenditures:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or state register of historic sites.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A contributing resource located within a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state register of historic sites.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A contributing resource located within a historic district designated by a local unit pursuant to an ordinance adopted under the local historic districts act, 1970 PA 169, MCL 399.201 to 399.215.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A person that has been issued a certificate of completed rehabilitation under subsection (4) may assign all or any portion of the credit allowed under this section. A credit assignment under this subsection is irrevocable and shall be made in the tax year in which a certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued. A qualified taxpayer may claim a portion of a credit and assign the remaining amount. If the qualified taxpayer both claims and assigns portions of the credit, the qualified taxpayer shall claim the portion it claims in the tax year in which a certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued pursuant to this section. Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, an assignee may subsequently assign the credit or any portion of the credit assigned under this subsection to 1 or more assignees. An assignment or subsequent reassignment of a credit shall be made in the year the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued. A credit assignment or subsequent reassignment under this section shall be made on a form prescribed by the office. The office shall review and issue a completed assignment or reassignment certificate to the assignee or reassignee. A credit amount assigned under this subsection may be claimed against the assignee's tax liability under this part or part 2. A credit amount authorized or assigned to a partnership, limited liability company, or subchapter S corporation under this section or section 676 may be claimed against the partner's, member's, or shareholder's tax liability under this part based on the partner's, member's, or shareholder's proportionate share of ownership or an alternative method approved by the office. An assignee or subsequent reassignee shall attach a copy of the completed assignment certificate to the annual return required to be filed under this part for the tax year in which the assignment or reassignment is made and the assignee or reassignee first claims the credit, which shall be the same tax year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the credit allowed under this section for the tax year and any unused carryforward of the credit allowed by this section exceed the qualified taxpayer's tax liability for the tax year, that portion that exceeds the tax liability for the tax year shall not be refunded but may be carried forward to offset tax liability in subsequent tax years for 10 years or until used up, whichever occurs first. If a qualified taxpayer has an unused carryforward of a credit under this section, the amount otherwise added under subsection (9) to the qualified taxpayer's tax liability may instead be used to reduce the qualified taxpayer's carryforward under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Except as otherwise provided under subsection (10), if a certificate of completed rehabilitation is revoked under subsection (5) or if the historic resource is sold or disposed of less than 5 years after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued, the following percentage of the credit amount previously claimed relative to that historic resource shall be added back to the tax liability of the qualified taxpayer that received the certificate of completed rehabilitation and not the assignee in the year of the revocation:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the revocation is less than 1 year after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued, 100%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the revocation is at least 1 year but less than 2 years after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued, 80%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the revocation is at least 2 years but less than 3 years after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued, 60%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If the revocation is at least 3 years but less than 4 years after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued, 40%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the revocation is at least 4 years but less than 5 years after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued, 20%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) If the revocation is at least 5 years or more after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued, an addback to the qualified taxpayer tax liability is not required.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Subsection (9) shall not apply if the qualified taxpayer enters into a written agreement with the office that will allow for the transfer or sale of the historic resource and provides the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Reasonable assurance that subsequent to the transfer the property will remain a historic resource during the 5-year period after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A method that the department can recover an amount from the qualified taxpayer equal to the appropriate percentage of credit added back as described under subsection (9).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An encumbrance on the title to the historic resource being sold or transferred, stating that the property must remain a historic resource throughout the 5-year period after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A taxpayer required to file a return under this part may be required to furnish a true and correct copy of any tax return or portion of any tax return and supporting schedules that the taxpayer has filed under the provisions of the internal revenue code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as provided in subsection (3), a taxpayer shall file an amended return with the department showing any final alteration in, or modification of, the taxpayer's federal income tax return that affects the taxpayer's taxable income under this part and of any similarly related recomputation of tax or determination of deficiency under the internal revenue code. If an increase in taxable income results from a federal audit that increases the taxpayer's federal income tax by less than $500.00, the requirement under this subsection to file an amended return does not apply but the department may assess an increase in tax resulting from the audit. The amended return must be filed within 180 days after the final determination date. If the department finds upon all the facts that an additional tax under this part is owing, the taxpayer shall immediately pay the additional tax. If the department finds that the taxpayer has overpaid the tax imposed by this part, a credit or refund of the overpayment must immediately be made as provided in section 30 of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.30. This subsection does not apply to the reporting of a final federal adjustment arising from a partnership level audit or an administrative adjustment request required to be reported under chapter 18.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For tax years that begin on and after January 1, 2018, a partnership that is not subject to chapter 18, but has determined that the partners' share of income, deductions, and credits previously reported to its partners and included in a return filed under this part requires adjustment, may, at the discretion of the department, file a report with the department and pay the tax due or claim a refund on behalf of its partners in a manner similar to the process set forth in chapter 18. Any refund issued to the partnership under this subsection is in lieu of any overpayment of taxes that may be claimed by the partners.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) As used in this section: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Administrative adjustment request", "final federal adjustment", and "partnership level audit" mean those terms as defined in section 721.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Final determination date" means the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii), if the federal adjustment arises from an IRS audit or other action by the IRS, the final determination date is the first day on which no federal adjustments arising from that audit or other action remain to be finally determined, whether by IRS decision with respect to which all rights of appeal have been waived or exhausted, by agreement, or, if appealed or contested, by a final decision with respect to which all rights of appeal have been waived or exhausted. For agreements required to be signed by the IRS and the taxpayer, the final determination date is the date on which the last party signed the agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) For federal adjustments arising from an IRS audit or other action by the IRS, if the taxpayer is a member of a unitary business group and required to file a combined return under section 691, the final determination date means the first day on which no related federal adjustments arising from that audit or other action remain to be finally determined, as described in subparagraph (i), for the entire unitary business group.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If the federal adjustment results from filing an amended federal return, a federal refund claim, or an administrative adjustment request or if the federal adjustment is reported on an amended federal return or other similar report filed under section 6225(c) of the internal revenue code, the final determination date means the day on which the amended return, refund claim, administrative adjustment request, or other similar report was filed.</div>

If the credit allowed under this section exceeds the tax liability of the taxpayer for the 2023 tax year, that portion of the credit that exceeds the tax liability must be refunded.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, the amount of the rebate to be issued and credit to be claimed under this section is $180.00 for each eligible taxpayer. For an eligible taxpayer who was married but did not file a joint return for the 2022 tax year, the amount of the rebate to be issued and the credit claimed under this section for that eligible taxpayer is $90.00.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In a manner as determined by the department, an eligible taxpayer is considered to have made a payment against the tax levied and imposed under this part for the 2022 tax year in an amount equal to the refundable credit allowed under this section for the 2023 tax year and an advance refund payment of that credit must be automatically issued by the department to each eligible taxpayer as soon as practical as provided in section 30 of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.30. The rebate authorized and advance refund payment issued under this section may be disbursed electronically to an account at a financial institution of the eligible taxpayer's choice to which the eligible taxpayer authorized the direct deposit of a refund of taxes on the annual return filed under this part for the 2022 tax year. If the eligible taxpayer did not include authorization for a direct deposit, the department shall issue a negotiable check and send it by first-class mail to the address shown on the annual return filed under this part for the 2022 tax year. The advance refund payment authorized under this section must be issued and paid from the Michigan taxpayer rebate fund created under section 51h. The department shall not issue an advance refund payment under this section after December 31, 2023.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Notwithstanding section 30a of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.30a, the advance refund payment issued under this section is exempt from interception, execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process to collect a debt. No portion of the advance refund payment allowed under this section or any rights existing under this section shall be applied as an offset to any liability of the eligible taxpayer under section 30a of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.30a, or any arrearage or other debt of the eligible taxpayer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The department may establish any procedures and require the submission of any information from the eligible taxpayer as necessary for the administration of this rebate and advance refund payment of the credit authorized under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) As used in this section: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Claimant" means that term as defined in section 504.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Eligible taxpayer" means an individual taxpayer who was a resident of this state as of December 31, 2022 and who filed an income tax return under this part for the 2022 tax year on or before October 18, 2023.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to the limitations and the definitions in this chapter, a claimant may claim against the tax due under this part for the tax year a credit for the property taxes on the taxpayer's homestead deductible for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 164 of the internal revenue code, or that would have been deductible if the claimant had not elected the zero bracket amount or if the claimant had been subject to the federal income tax. The property taxes used for the credit computation shall not be greater than the amount levied for 1 tax year. An owner is not eligible for a credit under this section if the taxable value of his or her homestead excluding the portion of a parcel of real property that is unoccupied and classified as agricultural for ad valorem tax purposes in the year for which the credit is claimed is greater than $135,000.00 through the 2021 tax year. Beginning with the 2021 tax year and each tax year after 2021, the taxable value cap under this subsection for the immediately preceding tax year shall be adjusted by the percentage increase in the United States consumer price index for the immediately preceding calendar year and rounded to the nearest $100.00 increment. The department shall annualize the amount in this subsection as necessary. As used in this subsection, "taxable value" means that value determined under section 27a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.27a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A person who rents or leases a homestead may claim a similar credit computed under this section and section 522 based upon 20% of the gross rent paid for tax years before the 2018 tax year or 23% of the gross rent paid for tax years after the 2017 tax year. A person who rents or leases a homestead subject to a service charge in lieu of ad valorem taxes as provided by section 15a of the state housing development authority act of 1966, 1966 PA 346, MCL 125.1415a, may claim a similar credit computed under this section and section 522 based upon 10% of the gross rent paid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the credit claimed under this section and section 522 exceeds the tax liability for the tax year or if there is no tax liability for the tax year, the amount of the claim not used as an offset against the tax liability shall, after examination and review, be approved for payment, without interest, to the claimant. In determining the amount of the payment under this subsection, withholdings and other credits shall be used first to offset any tax liabilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the homestead is an integral part of a multipurpose or multidwelling building that is federally aided housing or state aided housing, a claimant who is a senior citizen entitled to a payment under subsection (2) may assign the right to that payment to a mortgagor if the mortgagor reduces the rent charged and collected on the claimant's homestead in an amount equal to the tax credit payment provided in this chapter. The assignment of the claim is valid only if the Michigan state housing development authority, by affidavit, verifies that the claimant's rent has been so reduced.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Only the renter or lessee shall claim a credit on property that is rented or leased as a homestead.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A person who discriminates in the charging or collection of rent on a homestead by increasing the rent charged or collected because the renter or lessee claims and receives a credit or payment under this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor. Discrimination against a renter who claims and receives the credit under this section and section 522 by a reduction of the rent on the homestead of a person who does not claim and receive the credit is a misdemeanor. If discriminatory rents are charged or collected, each charge or collection of the higher or lower payment is a separate offense. Each acceptance of a payment of rent is a separate offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A person who received aid to families with dependent children, state family assistance, or state disability assistance pursuant to the social welfare act, 1939 PA 280, MCL 400.1 to 400.119b, in the tax year for which the person is filing a return shall have a credit that is authorized and computed under this section and section 522 reduced by an amount equal to the product of the claimant's credit multiplied by the quotient of the sum of the claimant's aid to families with dependent children, state family assistance, and state disability assistance for the tax year divided by the claimant's total household resources. The reduction of credit shall not exceed the sum of the aid to families with dependent children, state family assistance, and state disability assistance for the tax year. For the purposes of this subsection, aid to families with dependent children does not include child support payments that offset or reduce payments made to the claimant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) For tax years before the 2018 tax year, a credit under subsection (1) or (2) shall be reduced by 10% for each claimant whose total household resources exceed the minimum total household resources amount of $41,000.00 and by an additional 10% for each increment of $1,000.00 of total household resources in excess of $41,000.00. Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, for the 2018 tax year and each tax year after 2018, the minimum total household resources amount is $51,000.00. For the 2018 tax year and each tax year after 2018, a credit under subsection (1) or (2) shall be reduced by 10% for each claimant whose total household resources exceed the minimum total household resources amount established under this subsection and by an additional 10% for each increment of $1,000.00 of total household resources in excess of the minimum total household resources amount for that tax year. For the 2021 tax year and each tax year after 2021, the minimum total household resources threshold amount established under this subsection for the immediately preceding tax year shall be adjusted by the percentage increase in the United States consumer price index for the immediately preceding calendar year and rounded to the nearest $100.00 increment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the credit authorized and calculated under this section and section 522 and adjusted under subsection (7) or (8) does not provide to a senior citizen who rents or leases a homestead that amount attributable to rent that constitutes more than 40% of the total household resources of the senior citizen, the senior citizen may claim a credit based upon the amount of total household resources attributable to rent as provided by this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A senior citizen whose gross rent paid for the tax year is more than the percentage of total household resources specified in subsection (9) for the respective tax year may claim a credit for the amount of rent paid that constitutes more than the percentage of the total household resources of the senior citizen specified in subsection (9) and that was not provided to the senior citizen by the credit computed pursuant to this section and section 522 and adjusted pursuant to subsection (7) or (8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The department may promulgate rules to implement subsections (9) to (15) and may prescribe a table to allow a claimant to determine the credit provided under this section and section 522 in the instruction booklet that accompanies the respective income tax or property tax credit forms used by claimants.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A senior citizen may claim the credit under subsections (9) to (15) on the same form as the property tax credit permitted by subsection (2). The department shall adjust the forms accordingly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) A senior citizen who moves to a different rented or leased homestead shall determine, for 2 tax years after the move, both his or her qualification to claim a credit under subsections (9) to (15) and the amount of a credit under subsections (9) to (15) on the basis of the annualized final monthly rental payment at his or her previous homestead, if this annualized rental is less than the senior citizen's actual annual rental payments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) For a return of less than 12 months, the claim for a credit under subsections (9) to (15) shall be reduced proportionately.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) For tax years before the 2018 tax year, the total credit allowed by this section and section 522 shall not exceed $1,200.00 per year. Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, for the 2018 tax year and each tax year after 2018, the total credit allowed by this section and section 522 shall not exceed $1,500.00 per year. Beginning with the 2021 tax year and each tax year after 2021, the maximum amount of the credit allowed under this section and section 522 for the immediately preceding tax year shall be adjusted by the percentage increase in the United States consumer price index for the immediately preceding calendar year. The department shall round the amount to the nearest $100.00 increment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) As used in this section, "United States consumer price index" means the United States consumer price index for all urban consumers as defined and reported by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A claimant shall receive the greater of the credit amount as determined in subparagraph (i) or (ii):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Subtract 3.5% of the claimant's total household resources from the amount specified in subdivision (a) that corresponds with the number of exemptions claimed in the return filed under this part, except that the number of exemptions for purposes of this subdivision shall not exceed the actual number of individuals living in the household plus the additional personal exemptions allowed under section 30, and any dependency exemptions for individuals living in the household under a custodial arrangement, even if the exemptions may not be claimed for other income tax purposes. For a claimant whose heating costs are included in his or her rent, multiply the result of the preceding calculation by 50%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Subject to subsection (2), for a claimant whose total household resources do not exceed the maximum specified in the following table, as adjusted, that corresponds with the number of exemptions claimed in the return filed under this part, subtract 11% of claimant's total household resources from the total cost incurred by a claimant for heating fuel from a heating fuel provider during the 12 consecutive monthly billing periods ending in October of the tax year, and multiply the resulting amount by 70%:

That product shall be added to the maximum cost of the immediately preceding tax year and then rounded to the nearest whole dollar. That dollar amount is the new maximum cost for the current tax year. If the claimant received any credits to his or her heating bill during the tax year, as provided for in subsection (6), the credits shall be treated as costs incurred by the claimant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The maximum total household resources specified in subdivision (c)(ii) shall be adjusted by multiplying the respective maximum total household resources for the immediately preceding tax year by the percentage by which the average all urban Detroit Consumer Price Index for all items for the 12 months ending August 31 of the tax year for which the credit is claimed exceeds that index's average for the 12 months ending on August 31 of the immediately preceding tax year, but not more than 10%. That product shall be added to the immediately preceding tax year's respective maximum total household resources and then rounded to the nearest whole dollar. That dollar amount is the new maximum level for total household resources for the then current tax year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An enrolled heating fuel provider shall notify each of its customers, not later than December 15 of each year, of the availability, upon request, of the information necessary for determining the credit under this section. For a claimant for whom, at the time of filing, the department of health and human services is making direct vendor payments to an enrolled heating fuel provider, the enrolled heating fuel provider that accepts the direct payments shall provide the information necessary to determine the credit before February 1 of each year. If an enrolled heating fuel provider refuses or fails to provide to a customer the information required to determine the credit, or if the claimant is not a customer of an enrolled heating fuel provider, a claimant may determine the credit provided in subsection (1)(c)(ii) based on his or her own records.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A credit claimed on a return that covers a period of less than 12 months shall be calculated based on subsection (1)(c)(i) and shall be reduced proportionately.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The allowable amount of the credit under this section shall be remitted to the claimant, other than a claimant whose heating costs are included in his or her rent, in the form of an energy draft that states the name of the claimant and is issued by the department. For a claimant for whom, at the time of filing, the department of health and human services has identified the enrolled heating fuel provider or is making direct vendor payments to an enrolled heating fuel provider, the department shall send the energy draft directly to the claimant's enrolled heating fuel provider, as identified by the claimant. If the department establishes a program or pilot program for the direct payment of energy drafts to enrolled heating fuel providers, enrolled heating fuel providers may submit to the department, in a manner prescribed by the department, the names of their customers who are claimants. If a claimant whose name has been submitted meets the standards established by the department, the department shall send that claimant's energy draft directly to the claimant's enrolled heating fuel provider. If the enrolled heating fuel provider submits names of claimants who are not its customers and the energy drafts of any of those claimants are sent to the enrolled heating fuel provider, the enrolled heating fuel provider shall return the energy drafts or pay the value of the energy drafts to the department plus interest on the amount of the energy drafts at the rate calculated under section 23 of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.23, for deficiencies in tax payments. Except as provided in subsection (5), after July 31, a refundable credit for a prior tax year may be paid in the form of a negotiable warrant. The energy draft shall be negotiable only through the claimant's enrolled heating fuel provider upon remittance by the claimant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a claimant received home heating assistance from the department of health and human services, a governmental agency, or a nonprofit organization 12 months prior to remitting an energy draft to the claimant's enrolled heating fuel provider and the amount of the energy draft is greater than the total of outstanding bills incurred by the claimant with the enrolled heating fuel provider as of the date that the energy draft was remitted to the enrolled heating fuel provider, the enrolled heating fuel provider shall first apply the full amount of the energy draft to the claimant's outstanding bills and then apply any remaining amount to subsequent bills of the claimant until the full amount of the energy draft is used up or the expiration of 9 months after the date on which the energy draft was first applied to cover the claimant's outstanding bills. If there is any remaining energy draft amount at the end of the 9-month period, or if before the end of the 9-month period the claimant is no longer a customer of the enrolled heating fuel provider, the enrolled heating fuel provider shall remit the remaining amount to the claimant in the form of a fully negotiable check within 14 days after the end of the 9-month period or 14 days after the termination of services, whichever occurs sooner. If the claimant did not receive home heating assistance from the department of health and human services, a governmental agency, or a nonprofit organization 12 months prior to remitting an energy draft, the claimant, by checking the appropriate box to be included on the energy draft or application for participation with an enrolled heating fuel provider, may request from the enrolled heating fuel provider a payment equal to the amount of the energy draft less the amount of the outstanding bills. The enrolled heating fuel provider shall issue the payment within 14 days after the claimant's request. For purposes of this subsection, home heating assistance does not include the credit allowed under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a claimant whose energy draft exceeds his or her outstanding bills does not request a payment from an enrolled heating fuel provider under subsection (5), an energy draft remitted to an enrolled heating fuel provider shall be applied upon receipt to the claimant's designated account. The energy draft may be used to cover outstanding bills that the claimant has incurred with the enrolled heating fuel provider and to cover subsequent heating costs until the full amount of the energy draft is used or until 1 year after the date on which the energy draft is first applied to the claimant's designated account. If a credit amount remains from this energy draft after the 1-year period, or if prior to the end of the 1-year period a claimant is no longer a customer of the enrolled heating fuel provider, the heating fuel provider shall remit the remaining unused portion to the claimant in the form of a fully negotiable check within 14 days after the end of the 1-year period or within 14 days after termination of service, whichever is sooner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A claimant who is no longer a resident of this state, who is not a customer of an enrolled heating fuel provider, or whose heating fuel provider refuses to accept an energy draft shall return the energy draft to the department and request the issuance of a negotiable warrant. A claimant may return an energy draft to the department and request issuance of a negotiable warrant if the energy draft is impractical because the claimant has already purchased his or her energy supply for the year and does not have an outstanding obligation to an enrolled heating fuel provider. The department may honor that request if it agrees that the use of the energy draft is impractical. The department shall issue the warrant within 14 days after receiving the energy draft from the claimant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The enrolled heating fuel provider shall bill the department for credit amounts that have been applied to claimant accounts pursuant to subsection (6), and the department shall pay the bills within 14 days of receipt. The billing shall be accompanied by the energy drafts for which reimbursement is claimed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A claimant whose heating fuel is provided by a utility regulated by the Michigan public service commission is protected against the discontinuance of his or her heating fuel service from the date of filing a claim for the credit under this section through the date of issuance of an energy draft and during a period beginning December 1 of the tax year for which the credit is claimed and ending March 31 of the following year if the claimant participates in the winter protection program set forth in R 460.131 of the Michigan Administrative Code or if the utility accepts the claimant's energy draft. The acceptance of an energy draft by a utility is considered a request by the claimant for the winter protection program. The energy draft shall be coded by the department to denote claimants who are 65 years of age or older. If the claimant is a claimant whose heating cost is included in his or her rent payments, the amount of the claim not used as an offset against the state income tax, after examination and review, shall be approved for payment, without interest, to the claimant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If an enrolled heating fuel provider does not issue a payment or a negotiable check within 14 days or as otherwise provided in subsection (5) or (6), beginning on the fifteenth day or the fifteenth day after the expiration of the 9-month period under subsection (5), the amount due to the claimant is increased by adding interest computed on the basis of the rate of interest prescribed for delayed refunds of excess tax payments in section 30(3) of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.30. The enrolled heating fuel provider shall pay the interest and shall not bill the interest to or be reimbursed for the interest by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Only the renter or lessee shall claim a credit on property that is rented or leased as a homestead. Only 1 credit may be claimed for a household. The credit under this section is in addition to other credits to which the claimant is entitled under this part. An individual who is a full-time student at a school, community college, or college or university and who is claimed as a dependent by another individual is not eligible for the credit provided by this section. A claimant who shares a homestead with other eligible claimants shall prorate the credit by the number of claimants sharing the homestead.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A claimant who is eligible for the credit provided by this section shall be referred by the department to the appropriate state agency for determination of eligibility for home weatherization assistance and shall accept weatherization assistance if eligible and if assistance is available. A heating fuel provider that is required by the Michigan public service commission to participate in the residential conservation services home energy analysis program shall annually contact each claimant to whom it provides heating fuel, and whose usage exceeds 200,000 cubic feet of natural gas or 18,000 kilowatt hours of electricity annually, and shall offer to provide a home energy analysis at no cost to the claimant. A heating fuel provider that is not required to participate in the residential conservation services program shall not be required to conduct a home energy analysis for its customers. For all rental properties that are weatherized pursuant to this section, each agency that determines eligibility for weatherization assistance shall require that not less than 25% of the total cost of the weatherization services for that property shall be contributed by the property owner unless the property owner is also eligible for weatherization assistance or is a nonprofit organization, governmental agency, or municipal corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) If an enrolled heating fuel provider is regulated by the Michigan public service commission, the Michigan public service commission may use an enforcement method authorized by law or rule to enforce the requirements prescribed by this section on the enrolled heating fuel provider. If an enrolled heating fuel provider is not regulated by the Michigan public service commission, the department of health and human services may use an enforcement method authorized by law or rule to enforce the requirements prescribed by this section on the enrolled heating fuel provider.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) The department shall mail a home heating credit return to every individual who received assistance through the department of health and human services pursuant to the social welfare act, 1939 PA 280, MCL 400.1 to 400.119b, during the tax year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) The department shall complete a study by August 1 of each year, of the actual heating costs of each claimant who received a credit from the department under this section for the immediately preceding tax year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) The department may promulgate rules necessary to administer this section pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) The department shall provide a simplified procedure for claiming the credit under this section for claimants for whom, at the time of filing, the department of health and human services is making direct vendor payments to an enrolled heating fuel provider.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) The credit under this section is allowed only if there has been a federal appropriation for the federal fiscal year beginning in the tax year of federal low income home energy assistance program block grant funds of any amount. If the amount of federal low income home energy assistance program block grant funds available for the home heating credit is less than the full home heating credit amount, each individual credit claimed under this section shall be reduced by multiplying the credit amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount available for the home heating credit and the denominator of which is the full home heating credit amount. As used in this subsection, "amount available for the home heating credit" means the sum of the federal low income home energy assistance program block grant allotment for this state for the federal fiscal year beginning in the tax year and the amount as certified by the director of the department of health and human services carried forward from the immediately preceding fiscal year for the low income home energy assistance program block grant minus the sum of the amount certified by the director of the department of health and human services for administration of the low income home energy assistance program block grant, the amount certified by the director of the department of health and human services for crisis assistance programs, and the amount certified by the director of the department of health and human services for weatherization. For the 2014-2015 fiscal year and continuing through the 2026-2027 fiscal year, the amount used for weatherization each fiscal year shall be determined as provided under this subsection. If the total federal low income home energy assistance program block grant received for the current fiscal year is greater than or equal to 90% of the amount of block grant funds received in the immediately preceding fiscal year, then the amount of federal low income home energy assistance program block grant funds used for weatherization for that fiscal year shall be at least $6,000,000.00 but not greater than 15% of the total federal low income home energy assistance program block grant funds received for that fiscal year. If the total federal low income home energy assistance block grant received for the current fiscal year is less than 90% of the amount of block grant funds received in the immediately preceding fiscal year, then the amount of federal low income home energy assistance program block grant funds used for weatherization for that fiscal year shall be at least $5,000,000.00 but not greater than 15% of the total federal low income home energy assistance program block grant funds received for that fiscal year. The amounts under this subsection that require certification by the director of the department of health and human services or by the state treasurer and the director of the department of technology, management, and budget shall be certified on or before December 30 of the tax year and each tax year thereafter. As used in this subsection, "full home heating credit amount" means the amount certified by the state treasurer and the director of the department of technology, management, and budget to be the estimated amount of the credits that would have been provided under this section for the tax year if no reduction as provided in this subsection were made for that tax year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) A claimant who claims a credit under this section shall not report the credit amount on the claimant's income tax return filed under this part as an offset against the tax imposed by this part, but shall claim the credit on a separate form prescribed by the department. A credit claimed under this section shall not be allowed unless the claim for the credit is filed with the department on or before the September 30 immediately following the tax year for which the credit is claimed. For tax years after the 2017 tax year, a credit claimed under this section is not allowed unless the claimant provides the department with all of the information, as requested by the department of health and human services, necessary to comply with the requirements of the federal appropriation of the federal low income home energy assistance program block grant. The department shall disclose the information provided under this subsection to the department of health and human services or the United States Department of Health and Human Services or its successor. The confidentiality restrictions provided in section 28(1)(f) of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.28, do not apply to the disclosure required by this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) Notwithstanding section 30a of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.30a, the credit allowed under this section is exempt from interception, execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process to collect a debt. No portion of the credit allowed or any rights existing under this section shall be applied as an offset to any liability of the claimant under section 30a of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.30a, or any arrearage or other debt of the claimant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) The department shall meet with interested parties including enrolled heating fuel providers and advocacy groups to identify and implement methods of improving the processing of claims for the credit allowed under this section and payments attributable to those credits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) By July 1, 2018 and by each July 1 thereafter, the department of health and human services shall submit a report on the operation and effectiveness of the home heating and weatherization assistance programs under this section and any recommendations regarding the home heating and weatherization assistance programs to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of the senate and house of representatives appropriations committees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The senate and house of representatives committees on taxation and finance related issues.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The senate and house of representatives committees on energy and technology related issues.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(23) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Claimant whose heating costs are included in his or her rent" means a claimant whose rent includes the cost of heat at the time the claim for the credit under this section is filed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Enrolled heating fuel provider" means a heating fuel provider that is enrolled with the department of health and human services as a heating fuel provider.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Heating fuel provider" means an individual or entity that provides a claimant with heating fuel or electricity for heating purposes.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) and section 669, the sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer in this state during the tax year and the denominator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax year. The numerator of a taxpayer shall include its proportionate share of the total sales in this state of a flow-through entity that is unitary with the taxpayer. The denominator of a taxpayer shall include its proportionate share of the total sales everywhere of a flow-through entity that is unitary with the taxpayer. A flow-through entity is unitary with a taxpayer when that taxpayer owns or controls, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the ownership interests with voting rights or ownership interests that confer comparable rights to voting rights of the flow-through entity, and that has business activities or operations which result in a flow of value between the taxpayer and the flow-through entity, or between the flow-through entity and another flow-through entity unitary with the taxpayer, or has business activities or operations that are integrated with, are dependent upon, or contribute to each other.</div>

Sales between persons included in a unitary business group must be eliminated in calculating the sales factor. Sales between a taxpayer and a flow-through entity unitary with that taxpayer shall, to the extent of the taxpayer's interest in the flow-through entity, be eliminated in calculating the sales factor.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Sales of the taxpayer in this state are determined as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Sales of tangible personal property are in this state if the property is shipped or delivered, or, in the case of electricity and gas, the contract requires the property to be shipped or delivered, to any purchaser within this state based on the ultimate destination at the point that the property comes to rest regardless of the free on board point or other conditions of the sales. Property stored in transit for 60 days or more prior to receipt by the purchaser or the purchaser's designee, or in the case of a dock sale not picked up for 60 days or more, shall be deemed to have come to rest at this ultimate destination. Property stored in transit for fewer than 60 days prior to receipt by the purchaser or the purchaser's designee, or in the case of a dock sale picked up before 60 days, is not deemed to have come to rest at this ultimate destination. For purposes of this subdivision:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) "Dock sale" means a sale in which the purchaser uses its own or rented vehicles, or makes arrangements with a carrier, to pick up the property at the seller's location.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) "Stored in transit" means storing, staging, forwarding, or consolidating activities undertaken for further shipment or transfer of the property to the purchaser or purchaser's designee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Receipts from the sale, lease, rental, or licensing of real property are in this state if that property is located in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Receipts from the lease or rental of tangible personal property are sales in this state to the extent that the property is utilized in this state. The extent of utilization of tangible personal property in this state is determined by multiplying the receipts by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property in this state during the lease or rental period in the tax year and the denominator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property everywhere during all lease or rental periods in the tax year. If the physical location of the property during the lease or rental period is unknown or cannot be determined, the tangible personal property is utilized in the state in which the property was located at the time the lease or rental payer obtained possession.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Receipts from the lease or rental of mobile transportation property owned by the taxpayer are in this state to the extent that the property is used in this state. The extent to which an aircraft will be deemed to be used in this state and the amount of receipts that is to be included in the numerator of this state's sales factor are determined by multiplying all the receipts from the lease or rental of the aircraft by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of landings of the aircraft in this state and the denominator of which is the total number of landings of the aircraft. If the extent of the use of any transportation property within this state cannot be determined, then the receipts are in this state if the property has its principal base of operations in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Royalties and other income received for the use of or for the privilege of using intangible property, including patents, know-how, formulas, designs, processes, patterns, copyrights, trade names, service names, franchises, licenses, contracts, customer lists, custom computer software, or similar items, are attributed to the state in which the property is used by the purchaser. If the property is used in more than 1 state, the royalties or other income shall be apportioned to this state pro rata according to the portion of use in this state. If the portion of use in this state cannot be determined, the royalties or other income shall be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator. Intangible property is used in this state if the purchaser uses the intangible property or the rights to the intangible property in the regular course of its business operations in this state, regardless of the location of the purchaser's customers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Sales from the performance of services are in this state and attributable to this state as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all receipts from the performance of services are included in the numerator of the apportionment factor if the recipient of the services receives all of the benefit of the services in this state. If the recipient of the services receives some of the benefit of the services in this state, the receipts are included in the numerator of the apportionment factor in proportion to the extent that the recipient receives benefit of the services in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Sales derived from securities brokerage services attributable to this state are determined by multiplying the total dollar amount of receipts from securities brokerage services by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sales of securities brokerage services to customers within this state, and the denominator of which is the sales of securities brokerage services to all customers. Receipts from securities brokerage services include commissions on transactions, the spread earned on principal transactions in which the broker buys or sells from its account, total margin interest paid on behalf of brokerage accounts owned by the broker's customers, and fees and receipts of all kinds from the underwriting of securities. If receipts from brokerage services can be associated with a particular customer, but it is impractical to associate the receipts with the address of the customer, then the address of the customer shall be presumed to be the address of the branch office that generates the transactions for the customer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Sales of services that are derived directly or indirectly from the sale of management, distribution, administration, or securities brokerage services to, or on behalf of, a regulated investment company or its beneficial owners, including receipts derived directly or indirectly from trustees, sponsors, or participants of employee benefit plans that have accounts in a regulated investment company, shall be attributable to this state to the extent that the shareholders of the regulated investment company are domiciled within this state. For purposes of this subdivision, "domicile" means the shareholder's mailing address on the records of the regulated investment company. If the regulated investment company or the person providing management services to the regulated investment company has actual knowledge that the shareholder's primary residence or principal place of business is different than the shareholder's mailing address, then the shareholder's primary residence or principal place of business is the shareholder's domicile. A separate computation shall be made with respect to the receipts derived from each regulated investment company. The total amount of sales attributable to this state shall be equal to the total receipts received by each regulated investment company multiplied by a fraction determined as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The numerator of the fraction is the average of the sum of the beginning-of-year and end-of-year number of shares owned by the regulated investment company shareholders who have their domicile in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The denominator of the fraction is the average of the sum of the beginning-of-year and end-of-year number of shares owned by all shareholders.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) For purposes of the fraction, the year shall be the tax year of the regulated investment company that ends with or within the tax year of the taxpayer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Receipts from the origination of a loan or gains from the sale of a loan secured by residential real property are deemed a sale in this state only if 1 or more of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The real property is located in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The real property is located both within this state and 1 or more other states and more than 50% of the fair market value of the real property is located within this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) More than 50% of the real property is not located in any 1 state and the borrower is located in this state.</div>

The determination of whether the real property securing a loan is located within this state shall be made as of the time the original agreement was made and any and all subsequent substitutions of collateral shall be disregarded.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Interest from a loan not secured by real property is in this state if the borrower is located in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Gains from the sale of a loan not secured by real property, including income recorded under the coupon stripping rules of section 1286 of the internal revenue code, are in this state if the borrower is in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Receipts from credit card receivables, including interest, fees, and penalties from credit card receivables and receipts from fees charged to cardholders, such as annual fees, are in this state if the billing address of the cardholder is in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Receipts from the sale of credit card or other receivables are in this state if the billing address of the customer is in this state. Credit card issuer's reimbursements fees are in this state if the billing address of the cardholder is in this state. Receipts from merchant discounts, computed net of any cardholder chargebacks, but not reduced by any interchange transaction fees or by any issuer's reimbursement fees paid to another for charges made by its cardholders, are in this state if the commercial domicile of the merchant is in this state.</div>

Loan servicing fees derived from loans of another not secured by real property are in this state if the borrower is located in this state. If the location of the security cannot be determined, then loan servicing fees for servicing either the secured or the unsecured loans of another are in this state if the lender to whom the loan servicing service is provided is located in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Receipts from the sale of securities and other assets from investment and trading activities, including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and gains are in this state in either of the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The person's customer is in this state.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) For purposes of subsection (11), if a taxpayer can show that revenue mile information is not available or cannot be obtained without unreasonable expense to the taxpayer, receipts attributable to this state shall be that portion of the revenue derived from transportation services performed everywhere that the miles of transportation services performed in this state bear to the miles of transportation services performed everywhere.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to the limitations under this section, a qualified taxpayer with a certificate of completed rehabilitation issued pursuant to subsection (4) after December 31, 2020 and before January 1, 2031 may credit against the tax imposed by this part the amount determined pursuant to subsection (2) for the qualified expenditures for the rehabilitation of a historic resource pursuant to the rehabilitation plan in the year in which the certificate of completed rehabilitation of the historic resource is issued. The qualified taxpayer shall initially claim a credit under this section within 5 years after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued pursuant to subsection (4). If the credit is not initially claimed within 5 years after the certificate is issued, the certificate is no longer valid and the qualified taxpayer is no longer eligible to claim a credit under this section for that rehabilitation plan. Only those expenditures that are paid or incurred during the time periods prescribed for the credit under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code and any related treasury regulations shall be considered qualified expenditures.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to the limitations under this section, a qualified taxpayer that has claimed and received a credit for qualified expenditures under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code or has entered into an agreement under subsection (10) may claim a credit under this section equal to 25% of the qualified expenditures that are eligible, or would have been eligible except that the qualified taxpayer entered into an agreement under subsection (10), for the credit under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code or, if the qualified taxpayer is not eligible for the credit under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code, 25% of the qualified expenditures that would qualify under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code except that the expenditures are made to a historic resource that is not eligible for the credit under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) To be eligible for the credit under this section, a person shall submit an application and a rehabilitation plan to the state historic preservation office. Completed applications must be considered in the order in which the office received the completed applications and approved or denied within 120 days of receipt of the completed applications. If the office determines that the application is complete and the rehabilitation plan meets the criteria for a credit under this section, the office shall issue a preapproval letter to the applicant that states that the rehabilitation plan qualifies for the credit under this section and the maximum total amount of the credit reserved for which a credit may be claimed when the project is complete and a certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued for qualified expenditures pursuant to that rehabilitation plan. If an application is denied under this subsection, the applicant may file an appeal in a form and manner as prescribed by the office or subsequently reapply for the same rehabilitation plan or for another rehabilitation plan, or both. Subject to the limitations under this section, the total of all credits reserved under preapproval letters for rehabilitation plans approved under this section and section 266a shall not exceed $5,000,000.00 per calendar year. To the extent the office receives applications for the rehabilitation of small nonresidential historic resources for credits in excess of $2,000,000.00, not less than $2,000,000.00 of the $5,000,000.00 each calendar year shall be approved for small nonresidential historic resources. To the extent the office receives applications for the rehabilitation of large nonresidential historic resources for credits in excess of $2,000,000.00, not less than $2,000,000.00 of the $5,000,000.00 each calendar year shall be approved for large nonresidential historic resources. To the extent the office receives applications for the rehabilitation of residential historic resources for credits in excess of $1,000,000.00, not less than $1,000,000.00 of the $5,000,000.00 each calendar year shall be approved for residential historic resources. The office shall not issue a preapproval letter or certificate of completed rehabilitation that authorizes a qualified taxpayer to claim a credit of more than $2,000,000.00 in a single tax year for the same historic resource. If, for any calendar year, the office issues preapproval letters and reserves the maximum amount of tax credits allowed under this section for that calendar year, the office shall notify all applicants who have submitted completed applications and rehabilitation plans then awaiting approval or submitted for approval after the calculation is made that no additional preapproval letters for rehabilitation plans will be issued during that calendar year. The office shall also notify those applicants of the priority number given to the owner's application and rehabilitation plan awaiting approval. The applications and plans will remain in priority status for 2 years from the date of the original application and plan and will be considered for approval and reservation of tax credits in the priority order established in this subsection in the event that additional credits become available resulting from the rescission of approvals under this subsection or subsection (5) and at the beginning of the next calendar year. An applicant that has received a preapproval letter shall commence rehabilitation, if it has not previously begun, within 1 year after the issuance of the preapproval letter and complete the rehabilitation plan within 8 years after the issuance of the preapproval letter or the office will rescind the preapproval letter and reallocate the amount of the credit reserved for that rehabilitation plan. Upon completion of a rehabilitation plan for which a preapproval letter was issued, the applicant shall submit to the office documentation that the rehabilitation is complete and the completed rehabilitation of the historic resource meets the criteria under subsection (6) and either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) All of the following criteria:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The historic resource contributes to the significance of the historic district in which it is located or is individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or state register of historic sites.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Both the rehabilitation plan and completed rehabilitation of the historic resource meet the federal Secretary of the Interior's standards for rehabilitation and guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings, 36 CFR part 67.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) All rehabilitation work has been done to or within the walls, boundaries, or structures of the historic resource or to historic resources located within the property boundaries of the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The applicant has received certification from the National Park Service that the historic resource's significance, the rehabilitation plan, and the completed rehabilitation qualify for the credit allowed under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The office shall verify that the rehabilitation is complete and meets the criteria under subsection (3). However, if the applicant is eligible for the credit allowed under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code, additional documentation that the rehabilitation is complete for the credit allowed under this section is not required. Within 120 days after receiving verification, in a form and manner as prescribed by the office, that the rehabilitation is complete and meets the requirements of subsection (3), the office shall issue a certificate of completed rehabilitation to the applicant that states the rehabilitation plan submitted by the applicant has been completed, the amount of qualified expenditures, and the total amount of the credit allowed to be claimed by a qualified taxpayer under this section. If the amount of qualified expenditures incurred exceeds the amount of the tax credits reserved by the preapproval letter issued under subsection (3), the applicant may submit a request to the office, in a form and manner as prescribed by the office, for the issuance and approval of a certificate of completed rehabilitation in excess of the amount initially authorized in the preapproval letter. If the office determines that less than $5,000,000.00 has been reserved under preapproval letters issued for the calendar year, after priority has been given to those notified under subsection (3), then the office may issue a certificate of completed rehabilitation in excess of the amount included in the preapproval letter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The office may inspect a historic resource at any time during the rehabilitation process and may revoke the preapproval letter or the certificate of completed rehabilitation if the rehabilitation was not undertaken as represented in the rehabilitation plan or if unapproved alterations to the completed rehabilitation are made within 5 years after the tax year in which the certificate of completed rehabilitation was issued. The office shall promptly notify the department of a revocation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Qualified expenditures for the rehabilitation of a historic resource may be used to calculate the credit under this section if the historic resource is 1 of the following during the tax year in which a credit under this section is claimed for those qualified expenditures:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or state register of historic sites.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A contributing resource located within a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state register of historic sites.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A contributing resource located within a historic district designated by a local unit pursuant to an ordinance adopted under the local historic districts act, 1970 PA 169, MCL 399.201 to 399.215.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A person that has been issued a certificate of completed rehabilitation under subsection (4) may assign all or any portion of the credit allowed under this section. A credit assignment under this subsection is irrevocable and shall be made in the tax year in which a certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued. A qualified taxpayer may claim a portion of a credit and assign the remaining amount. If the qualified taxpayer both claims and assigns portions of the credit, the qualified taxpayer shall claim the portion it claims in the tax year in which a certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued pursuant to this section. Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, an assignee may subsequently assign the credit or any portion of the credit assigned under this subsection to 1 or more assignees. An assignment or subsequent reassignment of a credit shall be made in the year the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued. A credit assignment or subsequent reassignment under this section shall be made on a form prescribed by the office. The office shall review and issue a completed assignment or reassignment certificate to the assignee or reassignee.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the credit allowed under this section for the tax year and any unused carryforward of the credit allowed by this section exceed the qualified taxpayer's tax liability for the tax year, that portion that exceeds the tax liability for the tax year shall not be refunded but may be carried forward to offset tax liability in subsequent tax years for 10 years or until used up, whichever occurs first. If a qualified taxpayer has an unused carryforward of a credit under this section, the amount otherwise added under subsection (9) to the qualified taxpayer's tax liability may instead be used to reduce the qualified taxpayer's carryforward under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Except as otherwise provided under subsection (10), if a certificate of completed rehabilitation is revoked under subsection (5) or a historic resource is sold or disposed of less than 5 years after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued, the following percentage of the credit amount previously claimed relative to that historic resource shall be added back to the tax liability of the qualified taxpayer that received the certificate of completed rehabilitation and not the assignee in the year of the revocation:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the revocation is less than 1 year after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued, 100%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the revocation is at least 1 year but less than 2 years after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued, 80%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the revocation is at least 2 years but less than 3 years after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued, 60%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If the revocation is at least 3 years but less than 4 years after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued, 40%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the revocation is at least 4 years but less than 5 years after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued, 20%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) If the revocation is at least 5 years or more after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued, an addback to the qualified taxpayer tax liability is not required.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Subsection (9) shall not apply if the qualified taxpayer enters into a written agreement with the office that will allow for the transfer or sale of the historic resource and provides the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Reasonable assurance that subsequent to the transfer the property will remain a historic resource during the 5-year period after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A method that the department can recover an amount from the qualified taxpayer equal to the appropriate percentage of credit added back as described under subsection (9).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An encumbrance on the title to the historic resource being sold or transferred, stating that the property must remain a historic resource throughout the 5-year period after the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A provision for the payment by the qualified taxpayer of all legal and professional fees associated with the drafting, review, and recording of the written agreement required under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The office may impose a fee to cover the administrative cost of implementing the program under this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Certificate of completed rehabilitation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Certification of historic significance related to the historic resource and the qualified expenditures used to claim a credit under this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) The office shall submit an economic impact report that includes, to the extent available, all of the following to the legislature annually for the immediately preceding state fiscal year:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A taxpayer with a certificated credit under section 435 or 437 of the Michigan business tax act, 2007 PA 36, MCL 208.1435 and 208.1437, which certificated credit may be claimed in a tax year ending after December 31, 2011 may elect to pay the tax imposed by the Michigan business tax act, 2007 PA 36, MCL 208.1101 to 208.1601, in the tax year in which that certificated credit or any unused carryforward may be claimed in lieu of the tax imposed by this part. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided under this section, a taxpayer that reasonably expects liability for the tax year to exceed $800.00 shall file an estimated return and pay an estimated tax for each quarter of the taxpayer's tax year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) For taxpayers on a calendar year basis, the quarterly returns and estimated payments shall be made by April 15, July 15, October 15, and January 15. Taxpayers not on a calendar year basis shall file quarterly returns and make estimated payments on the appropriate due date which in the taxpayer's fiscal year corresponds to the calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, the estimated payment made with each quarterly return of each tax year shall be for the estimated tax base that is applicable to the taxpayer under chapter 11, 12, or 13 for the quarter or 25% of the estimated annual liability. The second, third, and fourth estimated payments in each tax year shall include adjustments, if necessary, to correct underpayments or overpayments from previous quarterly payments in the tax year to a revised estimate of the annual tax liability. For a taxpayer that calculates and pays estimated payments for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 6655(e) of the internal revenue code, that taxpayer may use the same methodology as used to calculate the annualized income installment or the adjusted seasonal installment, whichever is used as the basis for the federal estimated payment, to calculate the estimated payments required each quarter under this section. The interest and penalty provided by this part shall not be assessed if any of the following occur:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the sum of the estimated payments equals at least 85% of the liability and the amount of each estimated payment reasonably approximates the tax liability incurred during the quarter for which the estimated payment was made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For the 2013 tax year and each subsequent tax year, if the preceding year's tax liability under this part was $20,000.00 or less and if the taxpayer submitted 4 equal installments the sum of which equals the immediately preceding tax year's tax liability.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Each estimated return shall be made on a form prescribed by the department and shall include an estimate of the annual tax liability and other information required by the state treasurer. The form prescribed under this subsection may be combined with any other tax reporting form prescribed by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) With respect to a taxpayer filing an estimated tax return for the taxpayer's first tax year of less than 12 months, the amounts paid with each return shall be proportional to the number of payments made in the first tax year. A taxpayer with a tax year of less than 4 months is not required to file an estimated tax return or remit estimated payments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Payments made under this section shall be a credit against the payment required with the annual tax return required in section 685.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the department considers it necessary to insure payment of the tax or to provide a more efficient administration of the tax, the department may require filing of the returns and payment of the tax for other than quarterly or annual periods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A taxpayer that elects under the internal revenue code to file an annual federal income tax return by March 1 in the year following the taxpayer's tax year and does not make a quarterly estimate or payment, or does not make a quarterly estimate or payment and files a tentative annual return with a tentative payment by January 15 in the year following the taxpayer's tax year and a final return by April 15 in the year following the taxpayer's tax year, has the same option in filing the estimated and annual returns required by this part.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The tax may be computed as if this part were effective on the first day of the taxpayer's annual accounting period and the amount computed shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the taxpayer's first tax year and the denominator of which is the number of months in the taxpayer's annual accounting period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The tax may be computed by determining the corporate income tax base in the first tax year in accordance with an accounting method satisfactory to the department that reflects the actual corporate income tax base attributable to the period.</div>

A taxpayer, other than a taxpayer subject to the tax imposed under chapter 12 or 13, whose apportioned or allocated gross receipts are less than $350,000.00 does not need to file a return or pay the tax imposed under this part. The apportioned or allocated gross receipts of a flow-through entity shall be imputed to each of its members based upon the same percentage that each member's proportionate share of distributive income is to the total distributive income of the flow-through entity. A taxpayer whose tax liability under this part is less than or equal to $100.00 does not need to file a return or pay the tax imposed under this part.</div>

Any refund issued to the partnership under this subsection is in lieu of any overpayment of taxes that may be claimed by the partners.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A taxpayer that expects to owe additional tax as a result of a pending federal audit may make payments, in a form and manner as prescribed by the department, prior to the final determination date.

If a United States person included in a unitary business group or included in a combined return is subject to the tax under chapter 12 or 13, any corporate income attributable to that person shall be eliminated from the corporate income tax base and any sales attributable to that person shall be eliminated from the apportionment formula under this part.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A person that is part of an affiliated group may elect without the consent of the department to have all of the persons that are included in that affiliated group to be treated as a unitary business group. A taxpayer that elects to file as a unitary business group pursuant to this subsection shall compute its tax under this part in accordance with all other provisions of this part that apply to a unitary business group. The taxpayer shall make the election under this subsection on a form or in a format as prescribed by the department that is to be filed in a timely manner with the taxpayer's annual return. Each person included in the affiliated group is deemed to have agreed to be bound by the election made under this subsection and any renewal of that election and to have waived any objection to its inclusion in the affiliated group and treatment as a unitary business group. Each person that subsequently enters the affiliated group after the tax year for which the election is made is deemed to have consented to the application of and is bound by the election and to have waived any objection to its inclusion in the affiliated group and treatment as a unitary business group. An election made pursuant to this subsection is irrevocable and binding for and applicable to the tax year for which it is made and for the next 9 tax years. The election shall remain in effect for the time period in which the ownership requirements under this section are met irrespective of whether a federal consolidated group to which the unitary business group belongs discontinues the filing of a federal consolidated return or whether the common parent changes due to a reverse acquisition or acquisition by a related person. Upon the expiration of the election after it has been in effect for 10 tax years, an election may be renewed for another 10 tax years, without the consent of the department; provided however, that in the case of a nonrenewal a new election under this subsection is not permitted in any of the immediately following 3 tax years. The renewal shall be made on a form or in a format as prescribed by the department that is to be filed in a timely manner with the taxpayer's annual return after the completion of a 10-year period for which an election under this subsection was in place.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A person who disburses pension or annuity payments, except as otherwise provided under this section, shall withhold a tax in an amount computed by applying the rate prescribed in section 51 on the taxable part of payments from an employer pension, annuity, profit-sharing, stock bonus, or other deferred compensation plan as well as from an individual retirement arrangement, an annuity, an endowment, or a life insurance contract issued by a life insurance company. Withholding shall be calculated on the taxable disbursement after deducting from the taxable portion the same proportion of the total amount of personal and dependency exemptions of the individual allowed under this act. Withholding is not required on any part of a distribution that is not expected to be includable in the recipient's gross income or that is deductible from adjusted gross income under section 30(1)(e) or (f).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Every employer in this state required under the provisions of the internal revenue code to withhold a tax on the compensation of an individual, except as otherwise provided, shall deduct and withhold a tax in an amount computed by applying, except as provided by subsection (14), the rate prescribed in section 51 to the remainder of the compensation after deducting from compensation the same proportion of the total amount of personal and dependency exemptions of the individual allowed under this act that the period of time covered by the compensation is of 1 year. The department may prescribe withholding tables that may be used by employers to compute the amount of tax required to be withheld.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided under this section, for tax years that begin before July 1, 2016, every flow-through entity in this state shall withhold a tax in an amount computed by applying the rate prescribed in section 51 to the distributive share of taxable income reasonably expected to accrue after allocation and apportionment under chapter 3 of each nonresident member who is an individual after deducting from that distributive income the same proportion of the total amount of personal and dependency exemptions of the individual allowed under this act. All of the taxes withheld under this section shall accrue to the state on April 15, July 15, and October 15 of the flow-through entity's tax year and January 15 of the following year, except a flow-through entity that is not on a calendar year basis shall substitute the appropriate due dates in the flow-through entity's fiscal year that correspond to those in a calendar year. Withholding for each period shall be equal to 1/4 of the total withholding calculated on the distributive share that is reasonably expected to accrue during the tax year of the flow-through entity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as otherwise provided under this section, for tax years that begin before July 1, 2016, every flow-through entity with business activity in this state that has more than $200,000.00 of business income reasonably expected to accrue in the tax year after allocation or apportionment shall withhold a tax in an amount computed by applying the rate prescribed in section 623 to the distributive share of the business income of each member that is a corporation or that is a flow-through entity. For purposes of calculating the $200,000.00 withholding threshold, the business income of a flow-through entity shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying the business income by the sales factor of the flow-through entity. The sales factor of the flow-through entity is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales of the flow-through entity in this state during the tax year and the denominator of which is the total sales of the flow-through entity everywhere during the tax year. As used in this subsection, "business income" means that term as defined in section 603(2). For a partnership or S corporation, business income includes payments and items of income and expense that are attributable to business activity of the partnership or S corporation and separately reported to the members.

All of the taxes withheld under this section shall accrue to the state on April 15, July 15, and October 15 of the flow-through entity's tax year and January 15 of the following year, except a flow-through entity that is not on a calendar year basis shall substitute the appropriate due dates in the flow-through entity's fiscal year that correspond to those in a calendar year. Withholding for each period shall be equal to 1/4 of the total withholding calculated on the distributive share of business income that is reasonably expected to accrue during the tax year of the flow-through entity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) For tax years that begin before July 1, 2016, if a flow-through entity is subject to the withholding requirements of subsection (4), then a member of that flow-through entity that is itself a flow-through entity shall withhold a tax on the distributive share of business income as described in subsection (4) of each of its members. The department shall apply tax withheld by a flow-through entity on the distributive share of business income of a member flow-through entity to the withholding required of that member flow-through entity. All of the taxes withheld under this section shall accrue to the state on April 15, July 15, and October 15 of the flow-through entity's tax year and January 15 of the following year, except a flow-through entity that is not on a calendar year basis shall substitute the appropriate due dates in the flow-through entity's fiscal year that correspond to those in a calendar year. Withholding for each period shall be equal to 1/4 of the total withholding calculated on the distributive share of business income that is reasonably expected to accrue during the tax year of the flow-through entity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Every casino licensee shall withhold a tax in an amount computed by applying the rate prescribed in section 51 to the winnings of a nonresident reportable by the casino licensee under the internal revenue code.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Every eligible production company shall, to the extent not withheld by a professional services corporation or professional employer organization, deduct and withhold a tax in an amount computed by applying the rate prescribed in section 51 to the remainder of the payments made to the professional services corporation or professional employer organization for the services of a performing artist or crew member after deducting from those payments the same proportion of the total amount of personal and dependency exemptions of the individuals allowed under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Every publicly traded partnership that has equity securities registered with the securities and exchange commission under section 12 of title I of the securities and exchange act of 1934, 15 USC 78l, shall not be subject to withholding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, all of the taxes withheld under this section shall accrue to the state on the last day of the month in which the taxes are withheld but shall be returned and paid to the department by the employer, eligible production company, casino licensee, or race meeting licensee or track licensee within 15 days after the end of any month or as provided in section 705. For an employer that has entered into an agreement with a community college pursuant to chapter 13 of the community college act of 1966, 1966 PA 331, MCL 389.161 to 389.166, a portion of the taxes withheld under this section that are attributable to each employee in a new job created pursuant to the agreement shall accrue to the community college on the last day of the month in which the taxes are withheld but shall be returned and paid to the community college by the employer within 15 days after the end of any month or as provided in section 705 for as long as the agreement remains in effect.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A person required by this section to deduct and withhold taxes on income under this section holds the amount of tax withheld as a trustee for this state and is liable for the payment of the tax to this state or, if applicable, to the community college and is not liable to any individual for the amount of the payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) An employer in this state is not required to deduct and withhold a tax on the compensation paid to a nonresident individual employee, who, under section 256, may claim a tax credit equal to or in excess of the tax estimated to be due for the tax year or is exempted from liability for the tax imposed by this act. In each tax year, the nonresident individual shall furnish to the employer, on a form approved by the department, a verified statement of nonresidence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) A person required to withhold a tax under this act, by the fifteenth day of the following month, shall provide the department with a copy of any exemption certificate on which a person with income subject to withholding under subsection (6) or (7) claims more than 9 personal or dependency exemptions, claims a status that exempts the person subject to withholding under subsection (6) or (7) from withholding under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) A person who disburses annuity payments pursuant to the terms of a qualified charitable gift annuity is not required to deduct and withhold a tax on those payments as prescribed under subsection (1). As used in this subsection, "qualified charitable gift annuity" means an annuity described under section 501(m)(5) of the internal revenue code and issued by an organization exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsections (4) and (5), if a flow-through entity receives an exemption certificate from a member other than a nonresident individual, the flow-through entity shall not withhold a tax on the distributive share of the business income of that member if all of the following conditions are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The exemption certificate is completed by the member in the form and manner prescribed by the department and certifies that the member will do all of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The department may require the member to file the exemption certificate with the department and provide a copy to the flow-through entity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The department may require a flow-through entity that receives an exemption certificate to attach a copy of the exemption certificate to the annual reconciliation return as required by section 711. A flow-through entity that is entirely exempt from the withholding requirements of subsection (4) or (5) by this subsection may be required to furnish a copy of the exemption certificate in another manner prescribed by the department.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) With respect to an action required or permitted to be taken by a partnership under this section and any other proceeding or action permitted under this chapter or 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, the state partnership representative for the reviewed year has the sole authority to act on behalf of the partnership. The partnership's direct partners and indirect partners are bound by those actions. The state partnership representative for the reviewed year is the partnership's federal partnership representative unless the partnership designates in writing another person as its state partnership representative. The department may establish reasonable qualifications and procedures for designating a person, other than the federal partnership representative, to be the state partnership representative.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except for final federal adjustments subject to a properly made election under subsection (4), final federal adjustments must be reported as follows:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the partner's increase in the amount of tax due that results from the final federal adjustment is $25.00 or more, no later than 180 days after the final determination date, each direct partner for that reviewed year that is a corporate partner, resident partner, or nonresident partner whose payment is not included in the composite return payment under subdivision (a)(iii) shall file a federal adjustments report reporting that partner's share of the adjustments reported under subdivision (a)(ii) and pay any additional amount of tax due as if final federal adjustments had been properly reported, plus any penalty and interest as provided under 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31. If the department determines that the taxpayer has overpaid the tax imposed by this act, a credit or refund of the overpayment must be issued immediately as provided in section 30 of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.30.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An audited partnership that makes an election under this subsection is subject to the laws related to reporting, assessment, payment, and collection of the tax calculated under this act and under 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) No later than 90 days after the final determination date, file a completed federal adjustments report, including information as required by the department, and notify the department that it is making the election under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Subject to the limitation in subsection (5), no later than 180 days after the final determination date, exclude from final federal adjustments the distributive share of those adjustments attributed to direct exempt partners not subject to the tax under this act and pay an amount equal to the sum of the following along with any penalty and interest as provided in 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, in lieu of taxes owed by its direct partners and indirect partners:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) For the distributive shares of the remaining final federal adjustments that are attributed to direct corporate partners, determine the amount allocated or apportioned to this state under part 2 and multiply that share amount by the tax rate imposed under section 623 for the reviewed year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) For the distributive shares of the remaining final federal adjustments that are attributed to direct tiered partners determine, as prescribed by the department, as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) The distributive shares that are attributed to indirect corporate partners and that are allocated or apportioned to this state under part 2 and multiply that amount by the tax rate imposed under section 623 for the reviewed year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) The distributive shares that are attributed to indirect resident or nonresident partners and that are allocated or apportioned to this state under part 1 and multiply that amount by the tax rate imposed under section 51 for the reviewed year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(C) For the remaining distributive shares of the final federal adjustments that are not attributed under sub-subparagraph (A) or (B), determine the amount allocated or apportioned to this state under part 2 and multiply that amount by the tax rate imposed under section 623 for the reviewed year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) For the distributive shares of the remaining final federal adjustments that are attributed to direct partners subject to the tax under part 1, determine the amount allocated and apportioned to this state under part 1 and multiply that amount by the tax rate imposed under section 51 for the reviewed year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) In determining the amount of the tax under subsection (4)(b), if reasonably identified by the audited partnership, final federal adjustments must not include the distributive share of final federal adjustments attributed to any direct or indirect corporate partner that is unitary with the audited partnership for apportionment purposes as provided under section 663.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The direct and indirect partners of an audited partnership that are tiered partners, and all of the partners of those tiered partners that are subject to tax under this act are subject to the reporting and payment requirements of subsection (3) and the tiered partners are entitled to make the elections provided in subsections (4) and (7). The tiered partners or their partners shall make required reports and payments no later than 90 days after the time for filing and furnishing statements to tiered partners and their partners as established under section 6226 of the internal revenue code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) In accordance with procedures adopted by the department, an audited partnership or tiered partner may submit an application to the department, in a form and manner as prescribed by the department, for an alternative reporting and payment method within the time allowed for an election under subsection (3) or (4), as applicable. If the application is approved by the department, an audited partnership or tiered partner shall enter into an agreement with the department to utilize an alternative reporting and payment method, including applicable time requirements or any other provision of this section, if the audited partnership or tiered partner demonstrates that the requested method will reasonably provide for the reporting and payments of taxes, penalties, and interest due under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) An election made under subsection (4) or (7) is irrevocable, unless the department, in its discretion, determines otherwise. If properly reported and paid by the audited partnership or tiered partner, the amount determined under subsection (4)(b) or alternatively under subsection (7) is considered paid in lieu of taxes owed by its direct and indirect partners, to the extent applicable, on the same final federal adjustments. The direct partners or indirect partners may not take any deduction or credit under this act for this amount or claim a refund of the amount. This subsection does not preclude a direct resident partner from claiming a credit under section 255 against taxes paid to this state under this act, for any amounts paid by the audited partnership or tiered partner on the resident partner's behalf to another state or local tax jurisdiction. If a partnership or tiered partner fails to timely make any report or payment as required under this section, the department may assess direct partners or indirect partners for taxes owed as determined based on the best information available.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If a taxpayer files a federal adjustments report or an amended return as required and within the time period specified in this section, the department may not assess additional tax, interest, and penalties arising from final federal adjustments after the expiration of the limitations period specified in section 27a of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.27a. If a taxpayer fails to file the federal adjustments report within the time period specified in this section or the taxpayer files a federal adjustments report that omits adjustments or understates the correct amount of tax owed, the department may assess additional tax, interest, and penalties arising from those federal adjustments if the department issues a notice of assessment to the taxpayer within 6 years after the final determination date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A taxpayer that expects to owe additional tax as a result of a pending partnership level audit may make payments, as prescribed by the department, prior to the due date of the federal adjustments report.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Except for adjustments required to be reported for federal purposes by taking those adjustments into account in the partnership return for the year of adjustment, a taxpayer may file a claim for a refund or credit of the overpayment of the tax arising from final federal adjustments before the expiration of the statute of limitations established under section 27a of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.27a. For a taxpayer that is a partnership, any claim for a refund or credit under this section must be made within 2 years of the final determination date of the federal adjustment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The time periods provided for in this section may be extended as provided under either of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) By written agreement between the taxpayer and the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The department may promulgate rules to implement this section and establish procedures and interim time periods for the reports and payments required by tiered partners and their partners and for making the elections under this section. To the extent practicable, the department shall establish rules and regulations that conform as closely as possible to the federal rules and procedures.</div>
