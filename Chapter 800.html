<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A record of all major misconduct charges for which a prisoner has been found guilty shall be maintained and given to the parole board as part of the parole eligibility report prepared for each prisoner pursuant to section 35 of 1953 PA 232, MCL 791.235.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prisoner who is serving a sentence for a crime committed before April 1, 1987, and who has not been found guilty of a major misconduct or had a violation of the laws of this state recorded against him or her shall receive a reduction from his or her sentence as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   During the first and second years of his or her sentence, 5 days for each month.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as provided in section 34, all prisoners serving a sentence for a crime that was committed on or after April 1, 1987 are eligible to earn disciplinary and special disciplinary credits as provided in subsection (5). Disciplinary credits shall be earned, forfeited, and restored as provided in this section. Accumulated disciplinary credits shall be deducted from a prisoner's minimum and maximum sentence in order to determine his or her parole eligibility date and discharge date.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   This section shall not be construed to allow good time, disciplinary credits, or special disciplinary credits in cases of commuted sentences unless so stipulated in the executive order commuting the sentence.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Except as provided in section 34, all prisoners serving a sentence on December 30, 1982, or incarcerated after December 30, 1982, for the conviction of a crime enumerated in section 33b(a) to (cc) of 1953 PA 232, MCL 791.233b, are eligible to earn a disciplinary credit of 5 days per month for each month served after December 30, 1982.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A prisoner shall not earn disciplinary credits under this subsection during any month in which the prisoner is found guilty of having committed a major misconduct. The amount of disciplinary credits not earned as a result of being found guilty of a major misconduct shall be limited to the disciplinary credits that would have been earned for the month in which the major misconduct occurred. Any disciplinary credits not earned as a result of the prisoner being found guilty of a major misconduct shall never be earned or restored. The warden may order that a prisoner found guilty of a major misconduct, including but not limited to charges of rioting, inciting to riot, escape, homicide, or assault and battery, forfeit all or a portion of the disciplinary credits accumulated prior to the month in which the misconduct occurred. An order forfeiting accumulated disciplinary credits shall be based upon a review of the prisoner's institutional record.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The disciplinary credit committee, which is comprised of the prisoner's resident unit manager, custody officers in the resident unit with direct supervisory responsibilities over the prisoner, and the appropriate work or school assignment supervisor, shall be a part of the reclassification process and shall review, at least annually, the status of each prisoner in the housing unit who has forfeited disciplinary credits. The committee may recommend to the warden whether any forfeited disciplinary credits should be restored to the prisoner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In addition to disciplinary credits, a prisoner eligible for disciplinary credits under this subsection may be awarded 2 days per month special disciplinary credits for good institutional conduct on the recommendation of the disciplinary credit committee and the concurrence of the warden based on an annual review of the prisoner's institutional record. Special disciplinary credits shall not be awarded for any month in which a prisoner has been found guilty of a major misconduct.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The department of corrections shall promulgate rules pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, necessary to implement this subsection not more than 180 days after December 30, 1982.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   On and after April 1, 1987, a prisoner shall not earn good time under this section during any month in which the prisoner is found guilty of having committed a major misconduct. The amount of good time not earned as a result of being found guilty of a major misconduct shall be limited to the amount of good time that would have been earned during the month in which the major misconduct occurred. Any good time not earned as a result of the prisoner being found guilty of a major misconduct shall never be earned or restored.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The department of corrections shall promulgate rules pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, prescribing how much of his or her accumulated good time or accumulated disciplinary credits the prisoner may forfeit if found guilty of 1 or more major misconducts.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The warden may order that a prisoner found guilty of a major misconduct forfeit all or a portion of the good time accumulated prior to the month in which the misconduct occurred.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   The good time committee, which is comprised of the prisoner's resident unit manager, custody officer in the resident unit with direct supervisory responsibility over the prisoner, and the appropriate work or school assignment supervisor, shall be part of the reclassification process. The good time committee shall recommend to the warden the amount of special good time to be awarded and the restoration of any accumulated good time that has been forfeited.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   The warden, as a reward for good conduct, may restore to a prisoner the whole or any portion of the good time or disciplinary credits forfeited because of a finding of guilty for a major misconduct. However, forfeited good time or disciplinary credits shall not be restored without the recommendation of the disciplinary credit committee or good time committee and the prior written approval of the deputy director in charge of the bureau of correctional facilities or the deputy director in charge of the bureau of field services. Disciplinary credits or good time allowances that have not been earned because of institutional misconduct shall not be restored.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   A prisoner who has been sentenced concurrently for separate convictions shall have his or her good time or disciplinary credits computed on the basis of the longest of the concurrent sentences. If a prisoner is serving consecutive sentences for separate convictions, his or her good time or disciplinary credits shall be computed and accumulated on each sentence individually and all good time or disciplinary credits that have been earned on any of the sentences shall be subject to forfeiture pursuant to subsections (5) and (8).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   The warden of an institution may grant special good time allowances to eligible prisoners who are convicted of a crime that is committed before April 1, 1987. Special good time credit shall not exceed 50% of the good time allowances under the schedule in subsection (2). Special good time shall be awarded for good conduct only and shall not be awarded for any month in which a prisoner has been found guilty of a major misconduct.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   The parole board shall be exclusively empowered to cause the forfeiture of good time or disciplinary credits earned by a prisoner at the time of a parole violation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(14)   A prisoner subject to disciplinary time is not eligible for good time, special good time, disciplinary credits, or special disciplinary credits.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(15)   The court may order the reduction or forfeiture of 1 or more of the following credits pursuant to section 5513 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.5513:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The department may prohibit a prisoner from receiving or possessing any material that the department determines under this section is detrimental to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution, or that may facilitate or encourage criminal activity, or that may interfere with the rehabilitation of any prisoner. The department shall not prohibit a prisoner from receiving or possessing any material solely because the content of that material is religious, philosophical, political, social, or sexual, or because it is unpopular or repugnant. Material that may be prohibited under this section includes, but is not limited to, any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Material that depicts or describes procedures for constructing or using weapons, ammunition, bombs, or incendiary devices.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Material that depicts, encourages, or describes methods of escaping from correctional facilities or that contains blueprints, drawings, or similar descriptions of department institutions or facilities.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Material that depicts or describes procedures for manufacturing alcoholic beverages or drugs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Material that is written in code.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Material that depicts, describes, or encourages activities that may lead to the use of physical violence or group disruption.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Material that encourages or provides instruction in criminal activity.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Material that is sexually explicit and that by its nature or content poses a threat to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution, facilitates criminal activity, or interferes with the rehabilitation of any prisoner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The department of corrections shall not establish a list of material that may be prohibited under this section before the material is reviewed. This subsection does not prevent the department from prohibiting other prisoners from receiving or possessing identical copies of the material without review after the material has been initially reviewed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a publication is prohibited by the department, the department shall promptly notify the prisoner in writing that the material is prohibited and the reasons it is prohibited. The notice shall state the specific content upon which the prohibition is based. The department shall allow the prisoner to review the material to determine whether he or she wishes to administratively appeal the department's decision to prohibit the material unless the review would threaten the security, good order, or discipline of the institution, encourage or provide instruction in criminal activity, or interfere with the rehabilitation of any prisoner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   This section does not prohibit the department from setting limits on the amount of material an inmate may receive or retain in his or her quarters for fire, sanitation, or housekeeping reasons.</DIV>

Dec. 21, 1982 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> In People v Stanton, 400 Mich. 192; 253 NW2d 650 (1977), the Michigan supreme court declared 1972 PA 105, which amended this section, unconstitutional due to a defect in the title to 1909 PA 17. The law as embodied in the 1972 amendment was voided, not the act title. The amendment of the title by 1977 PA 164 following the declaration of unconstitutionality of a portion of the act itself did not suffice to resurrect the voided portion. If the voided portion is to be once again considered a part of the law, it must be “revised, altered, or amended” and “re-enacted and published at length” pursuant to Const 1963, art IV, § 25. People v Clabin, 411 Mich 472; 307 NW2d 682 (1981). This section and the title to 909 PA 17 were subsequently amended by 1982 PA 343.</p>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Inmates may be assigned to work in a private manufacturing or service enterprise that meets all of the following requirements:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The enterprise is suitably designed for the utilization of inmate labor. Prisoners shall not be granted access to any employee, customer or client information including, but not limited to, personal addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, credit card information or other financial information, health records, or any information contained in personnel, client or customer files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The enterprise either is located within 10 miles of a correctional facility or is located within a correctional facility pursuant to a lease agreement executed between the department of corrections and the enterprise. If the enterprise is located within a correctional facility, the enterprise shall pay to the local taxing authority an amount in lieu of ad valorem property taxes equivalent to the amount of ad valorem property taxes that would have been required if the enterprise had been located outside the correctional facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The enterprise manufactures products or renders services that are permitted to be manufactured or rendered using inmate labor, as determined under section 6(5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The ratio of the number of employees of the enterprise to the number of inmates assigned to work in the enterprise shall not be less than 1 employee to 3 inmates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Only those inmates who reside in a correctional institution having a security designation of level I, who are not serving a sentence of life imprisonment, and who volunteer for the assignment are eligible to be assigned to work in a private manufacturing or service enterprise. As used in this subsection, "security designation" means 1 of 6 levels of restrictiveness enforced at each correctional institution, as determined by the department, with security level I being the least restrictive and security level VI being the most restrictive.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The contract between the department and the private manufacturing or service enterprise shall ensure that a wage that is the higher of the prevailing wage or the minimum wage established under the minimum wage law of 1964, 1964 PA 154, MCL 408.381 to 408.398, shall be paid by the department to the inmate for work performed by the inmate in the private manufacturing or service enterprise. The wages of an inmate under this section shall be distributed in the following order:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The department shall withhold and pay the inmate's applicable state and local income taxes and federal income, social security, and medicare taxes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Of the balance remaining:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the inmate has been ordered by the court to pay restitution to the victim of his or her crime, 20% shall be paid for that restitution on the inmate's behalf, in accordance with the court order, until the amount of restitution is satisfied. If restitution is satisfied or if the inmate was not made subject to restitution, 10% shall be added to the escrow account under subparagraph (iv) and 10% shall be deposited with the state treasurer and credited to the crime victims rights fund created in section 4 of 1989 PA 196, MCL 780.904, in addition to the amount in subparagraph (v).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the inmate has a spouse or children, 20% shall be paid to the inmate's spouse or children for the purpose of family support. If the inmate's spouse or children receive aid to families with dependent children or general assistance under the social welfare act, 1939 PA 280, MCL 400.1 to 400.119b, while the inmate is incarcerated, the 20% designated in this subdivision shall be deposited with the state treasurer and credited to the general fund as repayment of that aid or assistance, until that amount of aid or assistance is repaid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Ten percent shall be paid to the inmate for his or her personal use while incarcerated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Ten percent shall be held by the department in an escrow account for the inmate, and shall be returned to the inmate upon his or her release.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) The balance remaining after the deductions specified in subparagraphs (i) to (iv) shall be deposited with the state treasurer and credited to the general fund, as partial reimbursement to the state for the cost of that inmate's imprisonment and care.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) The inmate shall not be eligible for unemployment compensation or retirement benefits upon his or her release from a work assignment or from imprisonment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The contract between the department and the private manufacturing or service enterprise shall provide that the department shall pay the applicable employer's share of federal social security and medicare taxes and state worker's disability compensation payments or contributions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The contract between the department and the private manufacturing or service enterprise shall provide that the enterprise shall reimburse the department for the amounts paid by the department for the purposes described in subsections (3) and (4). The contract also shall require the enterprise to pay to the department an annual administrative fee equal to 1% of the total amounts paid annually to the department by the enterprise for the purposes described in subsections (3) and (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The contract provisions created in this section shall not be construed as making the prisoner an employee of the state of Michigan.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The circuit court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all proceedings under this act. The attorney general may file a complaint in the circuit court for the county from which a prisoner was sentenced, stating that the person is or has been a prisoner in a state correctional facility, that there is good cause to believe that the prisoner has assets, and praying that the assets be used to reimburse the state for the expenses incurred or to be incurred, or both, by the state for the cost of care of the person as a prisoner.</DIV>

The complaint and order shall be served upon the prisoner personally or, if the prisoner is confined in a state correctional facility, by registered mail addressed to the prisoner in care of the chief administrator of the state correctional facility where the prisoner is housed, at least 30 days before the date of hearing on the complaint and order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   At the time of the hearing on the complaint and order, if it appears that the prisoner has any assets which ought to be subjected to the claim of the state under this act, the court shall issue an order requiring any person, corporation, or other legal entity possessed or having custody of those assets to appropriate and apply the assets or a portion thereof toward reimbursing the state as provided for under this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The amount of reimbursement under this act shall not be in excess of the per capita cost of care for maintaining prisoners in the state correctional facility in which the prisoner is housed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   At the hearing on the complaint and order and before entering any order on behalf of the state against the defendant, the court shall take into consideration any legal obligation of the defendant to support a spouse, minor children, or other dependents and any moral obligation to support dependents to whom the defendant is providing or has in fact provided support.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If the person, corporation, or other legal entity shall neglect or refuse to comply with an order under subsection (3), the court shall order the person, corporation, or other legal entity to appear before the court at such time as the court may direct and to show cause why the person, corporation, or other legal entity should not be considered in contempt of court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If, in the opinion of the court, the assets of the prisoner are sufficient to pay the cost of the proceedings under this act, the assets shall be liable for those costs upon order of the court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The state may recover the expenses incurred or to be incurred, or both, by the state for the cost of care of the prisoner during the entire period or periods the person is a prisoner in a state correctional facility.
