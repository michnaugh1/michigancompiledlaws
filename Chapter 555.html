</P>
<P>Sec. 104.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A fiduciary may adjust between principal and income to the extent the fiduciary considers necessary if the fiduciary invests and manages trust or estate assets as a prudent investor, the terms of the trust or will describe the amount that may or must be distributed to a beneficiary by referring to the trust's or estate's income, and the fiduciary determines, after applying the provisions in section 103(1) and (2), that the fiduciary is unable to comply with section 103(3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power conferred by subsection (1), a fiduciary shall consider all factors relevant to the trust or estate and its beneficiaries.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In exercising discretion under this section, a professional trustee may adopt a policy that applies to all trusts and estates, or a policy that applies to individual trusts or estates or classes of trusts or estates, stating whether and under what conditions it will use the adjustment power and the method of making adjustments.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A fiduciary shall not make an adjustment that does 1 or more of the following or under 1 or more of the following circumstances:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Diminishes the income interest in a trust or estate that requires all of the income to be paid at least annually to a spouse and for which an estate tax or gift tax marital deduction would be allowed, in whole or in part, if the fiduciary did not have the power to make the adjustment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Reduces the actuarial value of the income interest in a trust or estate to which a person transfers property with the intent to qualify for a gift tax exclusion.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Changes the amount payable to a beneficiary as a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust or estate assets.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Diminishes any amount that is permanently set aside for charitable purposes under a will or the terms of a trust unless both income and principal are so set aside.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes an individual to be treated as the owner of all or part of the trust for income tax purposes, and the individual would not be treated as the owner if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes all or part of the trust or estate assets to be included for estate tax purposes in the estate of an individual who has the power to remove a fiduciary or appoint a fiduciary, or both, and the assets would not be included in the estate of the individual if the fiduciary did not possess the power to make an adjustment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   If the fiduciary is a beneficiary of the trust or estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   If the fiduciary is not a beneficiary, but the adjustment would benefit the fiduciary directly or indirectly.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If subsection (4)(e), (f), (g), or (h) applies to a fiduciary and there is more than 1 fiduciary, a cofiduciary to whom the provision does not apply may make the adjustment unless the exercise of the power by the remaining fiduciary or fiduciaries is not permitted by the terms of the trust or will.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A fiduciary may release the entire power conferred by subsection (1) or may release only the power to adjust from income to principal or the power to adjust from principal to income if the fiduciary is uncertain about whether possessing or exercising the power will cause a result described in subsection (4)(a) through (f) or (4)(h) or if the fiduciary determines that possessing or exercising the power will or may deprive the trust or estate of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not described in subsection (4). The release may be permanent or for a specified period, including a period measured by the life of an individual.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Terms of a trust or will that limit the power of a fiduciary to make an adjustment between principal and income do not affect the application of this section unless it is clear from the terms of the trust or will that the terms are intended to deny the fiduciary the power of adjustment conferred by subsection (1).</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 105.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The court may not order a fiduciary to change a decision to exercise or not to exercise a discretionary power conferred by this act unless it determines that the decision was an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion. A fiduciary's decision is not an abuse of discretion merely because the court would have exercised the power in a different manner or would not have exercised the power.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The decisions to which subsection (1) applies include:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A decision under section 104(1) as to whether and to what extent an amount should be transferred from principal to income or from income to principal.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A decision regarding the factors that are relevant to the trust or estate and its beneficiaries, the extent to which the factors are relevant, and the weight, if any, to be given to those factors, in deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the discretionary power conferred by section 104(1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A decision under section 104(3) to adopt a policy applicable to individual trusts or estates or to classes of trusts or estates.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the court determines that a fiduciary has abused the fiduciary's discretion, the court may place the income and remainder beneficiaries in the positions they would have occupied if the discretion had not been abused, according to the following rules:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   To the extent that the abuse of discretion has resulted in no distribution to a beneficiary or in a distribution that is too small, the court shall order the fiduciary to distribute from the trust or estate to the beneficiary an amount that the court determines will restore the beneficiary, in whole or in part, to the beneficiary's appropriate position.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   To the extent that the abuse of discretion has resulted in a distribution to a beneficiary which is too large, the court shall place the beneficiaries, the trust or estate, or both, in whole or in part, in their appropriate positions by ordering the fiduciary to withhold an amount from 1 or more future distributions to the beneficiary who received the distribution that was too large or ordering that beneficiary to return some or all of the distribution to the trust or estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   To the extent that the court is unable, after applying subdivisions (a) and (b), to place the beneficiaries, the trust or estate, or both, in the positions they would have occupied if the discretion had not been abused, the court may order the fiduciary to pay an appropriate amount from its own funds to 1 or more of the beneficiaries or the trust or estate or both.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Upon petition by the fiduciary, the court having jurisdiction over a trust or estate shall determine whether a proposed exercise or nonexercise by the fiduciary of a discretionary power conferred by this act will result in an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion. If the petition describes the proposed exercise or nonexercise of the power and contains sufficient information to inform the beneficiaries of the reasons for the proposal, the facts upon which the fiduciary relies, and an explanation of how the income and remainder beneficiaries will be affected by the proposed exercise or nonexercise of the power, a beneficiary who challenges the proposed exercise or nonexercise has the burden of establishing that it will result in an abuse of discretion.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 201.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   After the decedent dies, in the case of an estate, or after an income interest in a trust ends, all of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A fiduciary of an estate or of a terminating income interest shall determine the amount of net income and net principal receipts received from property specifically given to a beneficiary under the provisions of articles 3 through 5 that apply to trustees and as provided in subdivision (e). The fiduciary shall distribute the net income and net principal receipts to the beneficiary who is to receive the specific property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A fiduciary shall determine the remaining net income of a decedent's estate or a terminating income interest under the provisions of articles 3 through 5 that apply to trustees and by doing all the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Including in net income all income from property used to discharge liabilities.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Paying from income or principal, in the fiduciary's discretion, fees of attorneys, accountants, and fiduciaries; court costs and other expenses of administration; and interest on death taxes, but the fiduciary may pay those expenses from income of property passing to a trust for which the fiduciary claims an estate tax marital or charitable deduction only to the extent that the payment of those expenses from income will not cause the reduction or loss of the deduction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   Paying from principal all other disbursements made or incurred in connection with the settlement of a decedent's estate or the winding up of a terminating income interest, including debts, funeral expenses, disposition of remains, family allowances, and death taxes and related penalties that are apportioned to the estate or terminating income interest by the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A fiduciary shall distribute to a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount outright the interest or any other amount provided by the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law from net income determined under subdivision (b) or from principal to the extent that net income is insufficient. If a beneficiary is to receive a pecuniary amount outright from a trust after an income interest ends and no interest or other amount is provided for by the terms of the trust or applicable law, the fiduciary shall distribute the interest or other amount to which the beneficiary would be entitled under applicable law if the pecuniary amount were required to be paid under a will.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A fiduciary shall distribute the net income remaining after distributions required by subdivision (c) in the manner described in section 202 to all other beneficiaries, including a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount in trust, even if the beneficiary holds an unqualified power to withdraw assets from the trust or other presently exercisable general power of appointment over the trust.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   A fiduciary may not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in subdivision (a) because of a payment or disbursement, or both, described in section 501 or 502 to the extent that the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than the property or to the extent that the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment from a third party. The net income and principal receipts from the property are determined by including all of the amounts the fiduciary receives or pays with respect to the property, whether those amounts accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of a decedent's death or an income interest's terminating event, and by making a reasonable provision for amounts that the fiduciary believes the estate or terminating income interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 202.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Each beneficiary described in section 201(d) is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to the beneficiary's fractional interest in undistributed principal assets, using values as of the distribution date. For purposes of this section, the fiduciary may estimate the value of assets for which market values are not readily available. If a fiduciary makes more than 1 distribution of assets to beneficiaries to whom this section applies, each beneficiary, including a beneficiary who does not receive part of the distribution, is entitled, as of each distribution date, to the net income the fiduciary has received after the date of death or terminating event or earlier distribution date but has not distributed as of the current distribution date.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In determining a beneficiary's share of net income, the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The beneficiary is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to the beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets immediately before the distribution date, including assets that later may be sold to meet principal obligations.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets must be calculated without regard to property specifically given to a beneficiary and property required to pay pecuniary amounts not in trust.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets must be calculated on the basis of the aggregate value of those assets as of the distribution date without reducing the value by any unpaid principal obligation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The distribution date for purposes of this section may be the date as of which the fiduciary calculates the value of the assets if that date is reasonably near the date on which assets are actually distributed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a fiduciary does not distribute all of the collected but undistributed net income to each person as of a distribution date, the fiduciary shall maintain appropriate records showing the interest of each beneficiary in that net income.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A fiduciary may apply the provisions in this section, to the extent that the fiduciary considers it appropriate, to net gain or loss realized after the date of death or terminating event or earlier distribution date from the disposition of a principal asset if this section applies to the income from the asset.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An income beneficiary is entitled to net income from the date on which the income interest begins. An income interest begins on the date specified in the terms of the trust or, if no date is specified, on the date an asset becomes subject to a trust or successive income interest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An asset becomes subject to a trust on 1 of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The date it is transferred to the trust in the case of an asset that is transferred to a trust during the transferor's life.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The date of a testator's death in the case of an asset that becomes subject to a trust by reason of a will, even if there is an intervening period of administration of the testator's estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The date of an individual's death in the case of an asset that is transferred to a fiduciary by a third party because of the individual's death.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   An asset becomes subject to a successive income interest on the day after the preceding income interest ends, as determined under subsection (4), even if there is an intervening period of administration to wind up the preceding income interest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   An income interest ends on the day before an income beneficiary dies or another terminating event occurs, or on the last day of a period during which there is no beneficiary to whom a trustee may distribute income.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 302.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as provided in section 201(a), a trustee shall allocate an income receipt or disbursement to principal if its due date occurs before the decedent dies in the case of an estate or before an income interest begins in the case of a trust or successive income interest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A trustee shall allocate an income receipt or disbursement to income if its due date occurs on or after the date on which the decedent dies or an income interest begins and it is a periodic due date. An income receipt or disbursement shall be treated as accruing from day to day if its due date is not periodic or it has no due date. The portion of the receipt or disbursement accruing before the date on which the decedent dies or an income interest begins shall be allocated to principal and the balance shall be allocated to income.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   An item of income or an obligation is due on the date the payer is required to make a payment. If a payment date is not stated, there is no due date for the purposes of this act. Distributions to shareholders or other owners from an entity to which section 401 applies are considered to be due on the date fixed by the entity for determining who is entitled to receive the distribution or, if no date is fixed, on the declaration date for the distribution. A due date is periodic for receipts or disbursements that must be paid at regular intervals under a lease or an obligation to pay interest or if an entity customarily makes distributions at regular intervals.</DIV>

Undistributed income does not include an item of income or expense that is due or accrued or net income that has been added or is required to be added to principal under the terms of the trust.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, when a mandatory income interest ends, the trustee shall pay to a mandatory income beneficiary who survives that date, or the estate of a deceased mandatory income beneficiary whose death causes the interest to end, the beneficiary's share of the undistributed income that is not disposed of under the terms of the trust. If the beneficiary has an unqualified power to revoke more than 5% of the trust immediately before the income interest ends, the undistributed income from the portion of the trust that may be revoked shall be added to principal.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   When a trustee's obligation to pay a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust's assets ends, the trustee shall prorate the final payment if and to the extent required by applicable law to accomplish a purpose of the trust or its settlor relating to income, gift, estate, or other tax requirements.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   As used in this section, “entity” means a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, regulated investment company, real estate investment trust, common trust fund, or other organization in which a trustee has an interest, other than a trust or estate to which section 402 applies, a business or other activity to which section 403 applies, or an asset-backed security to which section 415 applies.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a trustee who conducts a business or other activity determines that it is in the best interest of all the beneficiaries to account separately for the business or activity instead of accounting for it as part of the trust's general accounting records, the trustee may maintain separate accounting records for its transactions, whether or not its assets are segregated from other trust assets.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A trustee who accounts separately for a business or other activity may determine the extent to which its net cash receipts shall be retained for working capital, the acquisition or replacement of fixed assets, and other reasonably foreseeable needs of the business or activity, and the extent to which the remaining net cash receipts are accounted for as principal or income in the trust's general accounting records. If a trustee sells assets of the business or other activity, other than in the ordinary course of the business or activity, the trustee shall account for the net amount received as principal in the trust's general accounting records to the extent the trustee determines that the amount received is no longer required in the conduct of business.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   To the extent that a trustee accounts for receipts from rental property pursuant to this section, the trustee shall allocate to income an amount received as rent of real or personal property, including an amount received for cancellation or renewal of a lease.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If a trustee determines that an allocation between principal and income required by section 409, 410, 411, 412, or 415 is insubstantial, the trustee may allocate the entire amount to principal unless 1 or more of the circumstances described in section 104(4) apply to the allocation. This power may be exercised by a cofiduciary in the circumstances described in section 104(5) and may be released for the reasons and in the manner described in section 104(6). An allocation is presumed to be insubstantial if 1 or more of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The amount of the allocation would increase or decrease net income in an accounting period, as determined before the allocation, by less than 10%.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The value of the asset producing the receipt for which the allocation would be made is less than 10% of the total value of the trust's assets at the beginning of the accounting period.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As used in this section: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Payment" means a payment that a trustee may receive over a fixed number of years or during the life of 1 or more individuals because of services rendered or property transferred to the payer in exchange for future payments. The term includes a payment made in money or property from the payer's general assets or from a separate fund created by the payer. For purposes of subsections (4) to (7), payment also includes any payment from any separate fund, regardless of the reason for the payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Separate fund" includes a private or commercial annuity, an individual retirement account, or a pension, profit-sharing, stock-bonus, or stock-ownership plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) To the extent that a payment is characterized as interest, a dividend, or a payment made in lieu of interest or a dividend, a trustee shall allocate the payment to income. The trustee shall allocate to principal the balance of the payment and any other payment received in the same accounting period that is not characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If no part of a payment is characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment, and all or part of the payment is required to be made, a trustee shall allocate to income 10% of the part that is required to be made during the accounting period and the balance to principal. If no part of a payment is required to be made or the payment received is the entire amount to which the trustee is entitled, the trustee shall allocate the entire payment to principal. For purposes of this subsection, a payment is not required to be made to the extent that it is made because the trustee exercises a right of withdrawal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5), subsections (6) and (7) apply, and subsections (2) and (3) do not apply, in determining the allocation of a payment made from a separate fund to either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A trust to which an election to qualify for a marital deduction under section 2056(b)(7) of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 2056, has been made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A trust that qualifies for the marital deduction under section 2056(b)(5) of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 2056.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Subsections (4), (6), and (7) do not apply if and to the extent that the series of payments would, without the application of subsection (4), qualify for the marital deduction under section 2056(b)(7)(C) of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 2056.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A trustee shall determine the internal income of each separate fund for the accounting period as if the separate fund were a trust subject to this act. Upon request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall demand that the person administering the separate fund distribute the internal income to the trust. The trustee shall allocate a payment from the separate fund to income to the extent of the internal income of the separate fund and distribute that amount to the surviving spouse. The trustee shall allocate the balance of the payment to principal. Upon request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall allocate principal to income to the extent the internal income of the separate fund exceeds payments made from the separate fund to the trust during the accounting period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a trustee cannot determine the internal income of a separate fund but can determine the value of the separate fund, the internal income of the separate fund is deemed to equal 3.5% of the fund's value, according to the most recent statement of value preceding the beginning of the accounting period. If the trustee can determine neither the internal income of the separate fund nor the fund's value, the internal income of the fund is deemed to equal the product of the interest rate and the present value of the expected future payments, as determined under section 7520 of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 7520, for the month preceding the accounting period for which the computation is made.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 506.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A fiduciary may make adjustments between principal and income to offset the shifting of economic interests or tax benefits between income beneficiaries and remainder beneficiaries that arise from 1 or more of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Elections and decisions, other than those described in subsection (2), that the fiduciary makes from time to time regarding tax matters.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   An income tax or any other tax that is imposed upon the fiduciary or a beneficiary as a result of a transaction involving or a distribution from the estate or trust.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The ownership by an estate or trust of an interest in an entity whose taxable income, whether or not distributed, is includable in the taxable income of the estate, trust, or a beneficiary.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the amount of an estate tax marital deduction or charitable contribution deduction is reduced because a fiduciary deducts an amount paid from principal for income tax purposes instead of deducting it for estate tax purposes, and as a result estate taxes paid from principal are increased and income taxes paid by an estate, trust, or beneficiary are decreased, each estate, trust, or beneficiary that benefits from the decrease in income tax shall reimburse the principal from which the increase in estate tax is paid.
