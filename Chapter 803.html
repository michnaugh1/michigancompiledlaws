</P>
<P>Sec. 3.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A youth agency may receive and accept youths as public wards for purposes of care and rehabilitation. A youth agency shall accept a youth properly committed to it in accordance with law. Only 1 youth agency has responsibility for a youth at any time. The department shall not receive or accept youths as public wards for a county if that county is a county juvenile agency that assumed responsibility for public wards committed by the juvenile division of probate court, family division of circuit court, or court of general criminal jurisdiction for that county.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Custody of a public ward under this act is as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the department accepts the youth or responsibility for the youth is transferred to the department as provided in section 2a, the state, represented by the department director or his or her designate, has custody from the time of acceptance until the youth is discharged from wardship under section 7 or responsibility for the youth is transferred to a county juvenile agency under section 2a.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If a county juvenile agency accepts the youth or responsibility for the youth is transferred to the county juvenile agency under section 2a, the county has custody from the time of acceptance or transfer until the youth is discharged from wardship under section 7 or responsibility for the youth is transferred to the department under section 2a. For custody purposes, the county is represented by the county department director designated by the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   For a county that has adopted a charter under 1966 PA 293, MCL 45.501 to 45.521, the county executive or chief administrative officer. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)    For a county that has adopted an optional unified form of county government under 1973 PA 139, MCL 45.551 to 45.573, the county executive or county manager. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)    For a county not described in subparagraph (i) or (ii), the county board of commissioners. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a public ward is placed in a residential facility other than his or her own home, the youth agency shall provide the youth's food, clothing, housing, educational, medical, and treatment needs. The youth agency may consent to routine nonsurgical medical care or to emergency medical treatment of the youth, but consent for nonemergency elective surgery shall be given by the youth's parent or legal guardian. If a public ward is placed in his or her own home, the youth agency shall provide counseling services and may establish reasonable conditions under which the youth will be permitted to remain in the home, but the youth's parents retain all other parental rights and duties. </DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A youth agency may establish facilities and programs for the care of public wards. A youth agency shall supervise and operate facilities and programs or contract for the care of public wards, including institutions, halfway houses, youth camps, diagnostic centers, regional detention facilities and treatment centers, group homes, supervision in the community, or other child welfare services.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A youth agency may utilize the facilities, services, or personnel of any approved agency of this state and its political subdivisions or of any licensed private agency for the care and rehabilitation of public wards. A youth agency may contract with the family division of circuit court for the care and rehabilitation of public wards.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A youth agency may supervise a public ward placed in private home care.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A public ward may be placed in any facility, residence, or program described in this section. If the youth agency determines the best interests of a public ward require the involvement of another state or county entity, other than the department of corrections, then the youth agency and that state or county entity shall determine an appropriate care and treatment plan for the public ward. A youth agency may place a public ward in a mental institution under the mental health code, 1974 PA 258, MCL 330.1001 to 330.2106, unless the public ward resides with his or her parents. If the public ward resides with his or her parents, placement in a mental institution requires consent of the custodial parent. If placement in a mental institution occurs, the public ward shall be returned to the youth agency's custody upon release from the mental institution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   When necessary, a youth agency may place a public ward in a public or private institution or agency incorporated under the laws of another state or country and approved or licensed by that state's or country's approving or licensing agency, provided that the program which the youth agency seeks to place a public ward meets licensing laws, requirements, and rules required for the placement of a public ward with a public or private institution or agency in Michigan. However, if 1 or more appropriate juvenile residential care providers located or doing business in this state have bed space available, the youth agency shall use that space rather than a space available by a provider located or doing business in another state. This requirement does not apply if the provider located or doing business in another state offers a specialized program that is not available in this state. For purposes of placements by the department only, "appropriate juvenile residential care provider" means a private nonprofit entity domiciled in this state that is licensed by the department of consumer and industry services and that entered into 1 or more contracts with the department to provide residential care services for youths on or before the effective date of the amendatory act that added this sentence. </DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4), the county from which the public ward is committed is liable to the state for 50% of the cost of his or her care, but this amount may be reduced by the use of funds from the annual original foster care grant of the state to the county, or otherwise, for any period in respect to which the department has made a finding that the county is unable to bear 50% of the cost of care. If the department reduces a county's liability under this section, the director shall inform the respective chairpersons of the appropriations committees of the senate and house of representatives at least 14 days before granting the reduction. The county of residence of the public ward is liable to the state, rather than the county from which the youth was committed, if the juvenile division of the probate court or the family division of circuit court of the county of residence withheld consent to a transfer of proceedings under section 2 of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.2, as determined by the department. The finding that the county is unable to bear 50% of the expense shall be based on a study of the financial resources and necessary expenditures of the county made by the department. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as provided in subsection (4), the department shall determine the cost of care on a per diem basis using the initial annual allotment of appropriations for the current fiscal year exclusive of capital outlay and the projected occupancy figures upon which that allotment was based. That cost of care applies in determining required reimbursement to the state for care provided during the calendar year immediately following the beginning of the current fiscal year for which the state expenditures were allotted. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as provided in subsection (4), a county that is a county juvenile agency is liable for the entire cost of a public ward's care while he or she is committed to the county juvenile agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Notwithstanding the provisions in subsections (1) and (2) and subject to appropriations, the department shall implement a prospective payment system as part of a state-administered performance-based child welfare system in a county with a population of not less than 575,000 or more than 750,000, for foster care case management in accordance with section 503 of article X of 2014 PA 252. The county is only required to contribute to foster care services payments in an amount that does not exceed the average of the annual net contribution made by the county for cases received under section 2(b) of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.2, in the 5 previous fiscal years before October 1, 2015. The prospective payment system as part of the state-administered performance-based child welfare system shall be implemented as described in this subsection but shall not include in-home care service funding. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Subsection (4) only impacts abuse and neglect services and not juvenile justice program funding.</div>
