<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The governor may direct the attorney general or the prosecuting attorney of the county in which such officer may be, unless such prosecuting attorney be the officer charged, to conduct an inquiry into the charges made, and the said attorney general or such prosecuting attorney shall thereupon give at least 8 days' notice to the officer accused of the time and place at which he will proceed to the examination of witnesses in relation to such charges before some circuit court commissioner or judge of probate for the same county, or any judge of probate who may be appointed by the governor for such purpose, and he shall also, at the time of giving such notice, serve upon the officer accused a copy of such charges. If the judge of probate so appointed resides other than in the county in which the accused resides, such judge of probate shall be paid by such county the sum of $10.00 per day and expenses for time actually used in such hearing.</DIV>

The commissioner or probate judge shall make a preliminary examination of the testimony given by the witness before the grand juror and shall limit the availability thereof to those portions relevant to the removal proceeding.</DIV>
