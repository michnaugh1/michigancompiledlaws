<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The public service commission is vested with complete power and jurisdiction to regulate all public utilities in the state except a municipally owned utility, the owner of a renewable resource power production facility as provided in section 6d, and except as otherwise restricted by law. The public service commission is vested with the power and jurisdiction to regulate all rates, fares, fees, charges, services, rules, conditions of service, and all other matters pertaining to the formation, operation, or direction of public utilities. The public service commission is further granted the power and jurisdiction to hear and pass upon all matters pertaining to, necessary, or incident to the regulation of public utilities, including electric light and power companies, whether private, corporate, or cooperative; water, telegraph, oil, gas, and pipeline companies; motor carriers; private wastewater treatment facilities; and all public transportation and communication agencies other than railroads and railroad companies.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A gas utility, electric utility, or steam utility shall not increase its rates and charges or alter, change, or amend any rate or rate schedules, the effect of which will be to increase the cost of services to its customers, without first receiving commission approval as provided in this section. A utility shall coordinate with the commission staff in advance of filing its general rate case application under this section to avoid resource challenges with applications being filed at the same time as applications filed under this section by other utilities. In the case of electric utilities serving more than 1,000,000 customers in this state, the commission may, if necessary, order a delay in filing an application to establish a 21-day spacing between filings of electric utilities serving more than 1,000,000 customers in this state. The utility shall place in evidence facts relied upon to support the utility's petition or application to increase its rates and charges, or to alter, change, or amend any rate or rate schedules. The commission shall require notice to be given to all interested parties within the service area to be affected, and allow interested parties a reasonable opportunity for a full and complete hearing. A utility may use projected costs and revenues for a future consecutive 12-month period in developing its requested rates and charges. The commission shall notify the utility within 30 days after filing, whether the utility's petition or application is complete. A petition or application is considered complete if it complies with the rate application filing forms and instructions adopted under subsection (8). If the application is not complete, the commission shall notify the utility of all information necessary to make that filing complete. If the commission has not notified the utility within 30 days of whether the utility's petition or application is complete, the application is considered complete. Concurrently with filing a complete application, or at any time after filing a complete application, a gas utility serving fewer than 1,000,000 customers in this state may file a motion seeking partial and immediate rate relief. After providing notice to the interested parties within the service area to be affected and affording interested parties a reasonable opportunity to present written evidence and written arguments relevant to the motion seeking partial and immediate rate relief, the commission shall make a finding and enter an order granting or denying partial and immediate relief within 180 days after the motion seeking partial and immediate rate relief was submitted. The commission has 12 months to issue a final order in a case in which a gas utility has filed a motion seeking partial and immediate rate relief.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the commission has not issued an order within 180 days after the filing of a complete application, the utility may implement up to the amount of the proposed annual rate request through equal percentage increases or decreases applied to all base rates. If the utility uses projected costs and revenues for a future period in developing its requested rates and charges, the utility may not implement the equal percentage increases or decreases before the calendar date corresponding to the start of the projected 12-month period. For good cause, the commission may issue a temporary order preventing or delaying a utility from implementing its proposed rates or charges. If a utility implements increased rates or charges under this subsection before the commission issues a final order, that utility shall refund to customers, with interest, any portion of the total revenues collected through application of the equal percentage increase that exceed the total that would have been produced by the rates or charges subsequently ordered by the commission in its final order. The commission shall allocate any refund required by this subsection among primary customers based upon their pro rata share of the total revenue collected through the applicable increase, and among secondary and residential customers in a manner to be determined by the commission. The rate of interest for refunds is 5% plus the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) for the appropriate time period. For any portion of the refund that, exclusive of interest, exceeds 25% of the annual revenue increase awarded by the commission in its final order, the rate of interest is the authorized rate of return on the common stock of the utility during the appropriate period. Any refund or interest awarded under this subsection must not be included, in whole or in part, in any application for a rate increase by a utility. This subsection only applies to completed applications filed with the commission before April 20, 2017.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) This section does not impair the commission's ability to issue a show cause order as part of its rate-making authority. An alteration or amendment in rates or rate schedules applied for by a public utility that will not result in an increase in the cost of service to its customers may be authorized and approved without notice or hearing. There shall be no increase in rates based upon changes in cost of fuel, purchased gas, or purchased steam unless notice has been given within the service area to be affected, and there has been an opportunity for a full and complete hearing on the cost of fuel, purchased gas, or purchased steam. The rates charged by any utility under an automatic fuel, purchased gas, or purchased steam adjustment clause shall not be altered, changed, or amended unless notice has been given within the service area to be affected, and there has been an opportunity for a full and complete hearing on the cost of the fuel, purchased gas, or purchased steam.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The commission shall adopt rules and procedures for the filing, investigation, and hearing of petitions or applications to increase or decrease utility rates and charges as the commission finds necessary or appropriate to enable it to reach a final decision with respect to petitions or applications within a period of time allotted by law to issue a final order after the filing of the complete petitions or applications. The commission shall not authorize or approve adjustment clauses that operate without notice and an opportunity for a full and complete hearing, and all such clauses are abolished. The commission may hold a full and complete hearing to determine the cost of fuel, purchased gas, purchased steam, or purchased power separately from a full and complete hearing on a general rate case and may hold that hearing concurrently with the general rate case. The commission shall authorize a utility to recover the cost of fuel, purchased gas, purchased steam, or purchased power only to the extent that the purchases are reasonable and prudent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and subsection (1), if the commission fails to reach a final decision with respect to a completed petition or application to increase or decrease utility rates within the 10-month period following the filing of the completed petition or application, the petition or application is considered approved. If a utility makes any significant amendment to its filing, the commission has an additional 10 months after the date of the amendment to reach a final decision on the petition or application. If the utility files for an extension of time, the commission shall extend the 10-month period by the amount of additional time requested by the utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A utility shall not file a general rate case application for an increase in rates earlier than 12 months after the date of the filing of a complete prior general rate case application. A utility may not file a new general rate case application until the commission has issued a final order on a prior general rate case or until the rates are approved under subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The commission shall, if requested by a gas utility, establish load retention transportation rate schedules or approve gas transportation contracts as required for the purpose of serving industrial or commercial customers whose individual annual transportation volumes exceed 500,000 decatherms on the gas utility's system. The commission shall approve these rate schedules or approve transportation contracts entered into by the utility in good faith if the industrial or commercial customer has the installed capability to use an alternative fuel or otherwise has a viable alternative to receiving natural gas transportation service from the utility, the customer can obtain the alternative fuel or gas transportation from an alternative source at a price that would cause them not to use the gas utility's system, and the customer, as a result of their use of the system and receipt of transportation service, makes a significant contribution to the utility's fixed costs. The commission shall adopt accounting and rate-making policies to ensure that the discounts associated with the transportation rate schedules and contracts are recovered by the gas utility through charges applicable to other customers if the incremental costs related to the discounts are no greater than the costs that would be passed on to those customers as the result of a loss of the industrial or commercial customer's contribution to a utility's fixed costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The commission shall adopt standard rate application filing forms and instructions for use in all general rate cases filed by utilities whose rates are regulated by the commission. For cooperative electric utilities whose rates are regulated by the commission, in addition to rate applications filed under this section, the commission shall continue to allow for rate filings based on the cooperative's times interest earned ratio. The commission may modify the standard rate application forms and instructions adopted under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If, on or before January 1, 2008, a merchant plant entered into a contract with an initial term of 20 years or more to sell electricity to an electric utility whose rates are regulated by the commission with 1,000,000 or more retail customers in this state and if, before January 1, 2008, the merchant plant generated electricity under that contract, in whole or in part, from wood or solid wood wastes, then the merchant plant shall, upon petition by the merchant plant, and subject to the limitation set forth in subsection (10), recover the amount, if any, by which the merchant plant's reasonably and prudently incurred actual fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs exceed the amount that the merchant plant is paid under the contract for those costs. This subsection does not apply to landfill gas plants, hydro plants, municipal solid waste plants, or to merchant plants engaged in litigation against an electric utility seeking higher payments for power delivered pursuant to contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The total aggregate additional amounts recoverable by merchant plants under subsection (9) in excess of the amounts paid under the contracts must not exceed $1,000,000.00 per month for each affected electric utility. The $1,000,000.00 per month limit specified in this subsection must be reviewed by the commission upon petition of the merchant plant filed no more than once per year and may be adjusted if the commission finds that the eligible merchant plants reasonably and prudently incurred actual fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs exceed the amount that those merchant plants are paid under the contract by more than $1,000,000.00 per month. The annual amount of the adjustments must not exceed a rate equal to the United States Consumer Price Index. The commission shall not make an adjustment unless each affected merchant plant files a petition with the commission. If the total aggregate amount by which the eligible merchant plants reasonably and prudently incurred actual fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs determined by the commission exceed the amount that the merchant plants are paid under the contract by more than $1,000,000.00 per month, the commission shall allocate the additional $1,000,000.00 per month payment among the eligible merchant plants based upon the relationship of excess costs among the eligible merchant plants. The $1,000,000.00 limit specified in this subsection, as adjusted, does not apply to actual fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs that are incurred due to changes in federal or state environmental laws or regulations that are implemented after October 6, 2008. The $1,000,000.00 per month payment limit under this subsection does not apply to merchant plants eligible under subsection (9) whose electricity is purchased by a utility that is using wood or wood waste or fuels derived from those materials for fuel in their power plants. As used in this subsection, "United States Consumer Price Index" means the United States Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers as defined and reported by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The commission shall issue orders to permit the recovery authorized under subsections (9) and (10) upon petition of the merchant plant. The merchant plant is not required to alter or amend the existing contract with the electric utility in order to obtain the recovery under subsections (9) and (10). The commission shall permit or require the electric utility whose rates are regulated by the commission to recover from its ratepayers all fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs that the electric utility is required to pay to the merchant plant as reasonably and prudently incurred costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Subject to subsection (13), if requested by an electric utility with less than 200,000 customers in this state, the commission shall approve an appropriate revenue decoupling mechanism that adjusts for decreases in actual sales compared to the projected levels used in that utility's most recent rate case that are the result of implemented energy waste reduction, conservation, demand-side programs, and other waste reduction measures, if the utility first demonstrates the following to the commission:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That the projected sales forecast in the utility's most recent rate case is reasonable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That the electric utility has achieved annual incremental energy savings at least equal to the lesser of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The incremental energy savings requirement of section 77(1) of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1077.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The amount of any incremental savings yielded by energy waste reduction, conservation, demand-side programs, and other waste reduction measures approved by the commission in that utility's most recent integrated resource plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The commission shall consider the aggregate revenues attributable to revenue decoupling mechanisms, financial incentives, and shared savings mechanisms the commission has approved for an electric utility relative to energy waste reduction, conservation, demand-side programs, peak load reduction, and other waste reduction measures. The commission may approve an alternative methodology for a revenue decoupling mechanism authorized under subsection (12) or a financial incentive authorized under section 75 of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1075, if the commission determines that the resulting aggregate revenues from those mechanisms would not result in a reasonable and cost-effective method to ensure that investments in energy waste reduction, demand-side programs, peak load reduction, and other waste reduction measures are not disfavored when compared to utility supply-side investments. The commission's consideration of an alternative methodology under this subsection must be conducted as a contested case in accordance with chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.288.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) By April 20, 2018, the commission shall conduct a study on an appropriate tariff reflecting equitable cost of service for utility revenue requirements for customers who participate in a net metering program or distributed generation program under the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1001 to 460.1211. In any rate case filed after June 1, 2018, the commission shall, subject to section 173(7) of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1173, approve such a tariff for inclusion in the rates of all customers participating in a net metering or distributed generation program under the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1001 to 460.1211. A tariff established under this subsection does not apply to customers participating in a net metering program under the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1001 to 460.1211, before the date that the commission establishes a tariff under this subsection, who continues to participate in the program at their current site or facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) Except as otherwise provided in this act, "utility" and "electric utility" do not include a municipally owned electric utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Full and complete hearing" means a hearing that provides interested parties a reasonable opportunity to present and cross-examine evidence and present arguments relevant to the specific element or elements of the request that are the subject of the hearing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "General rate case" means a proceeding initiated by a utility in an application filed with the commission that alleges a revenue deficiency and requests an increase in the schedule of rates or charges based on the utility's total cost of providing service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Steam utility" means a steam distribution company regulated by the commission.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 6b.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If the rates of any gas utility shall be based, among other considerations, upon the cost of natural gas purchased by said gas utility which is in turn distributed by said gas utility to the public served by it, and the cost for such gas is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission, the Michigan public service commission shall have the authority set forth in this section. In any proceeding to increase the rates and charges or to alter, change or amend any rate or rate schedule of a gas utility, the Michigan public service commission shall be permitted to and shall receive in evidence the rates, charges, classifications and schedules on file with the federal energy regulatory commission whereby the cost of gas purchased or received by such gas utility is fixed and determined. If, while such proceeding is pending before the Michigan public service commission, a proceeding shall be instituted or be pending before said federal energy regulatory commission, or on appeal therefrom in a court having jurisdiction, with respect to or affecting the cost of gas payable by such gas utility, said Michigan public service commission shall consider as an item of operating expense to said gas utility the cost of gas set forth in said rates, charges, classifications and schedules on file with the federal energy regulatory commission. If the cost of gas payable by said gas utility shall be reduced by the final order of the federal energy regulatory commission or the final decree of the court, if appealed thereto, and the Michigan public service commission shall have entered an order approving rates to said gas utility as aforesaid based upon the cost of gas set forth in the rates, charges, classifications and schedules on file with the federal energy regulatory commission which were later reduced as above set forth, the Michigan public service commission upon its own motion or upon complaint and after notice and hearing may proceed to order refund to the gas utility's customers of any sums refunded to the said gas utility for the period subsequent to the effective date of the Michigan public service commission order approving rates for the gas utility as above set forth. No member of this 81st Legislature shall accept an employment position with any utility in this state within 2 years after vacating his or her legislative office.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 6h.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   As used in this act:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Commission" or "public service commission" means the Michigan public service commission created in section 1.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Gas cost recovery clause" means an adjustment clause in the rates or rate schedule of a gas utility which permits the monthly adjustment of rates for gas in order to allow the utility to recover the booked costs of gas sold by the utility if incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   "Gas cost recovery factor" means that element of the rates to be charged for gas service to reflect gas costs incurred by a gas utility and made pursuant to a gas cost recovery clause incorporated in the rates or rate schedules of a gas utility.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   "General rate case" means a proceeding before the commission in which interested parties are given notice and a reasonable opportunity for a full and complete hearing on a utility's total cost of service and all other lawful elements properly to be considered in determining just and reasonable rates.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Pursuant to its authority under this act, the public service commission may incorporate a gas cost recovery clause in the rates or rate schedule of a gas utility, but is not required to do so. Any order incorporating a gas cost recovery clause shall be as a result of a hearing solely on the question of the inclusion of the clause in the rates or rate schedule, which hearing shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, being sections 24.271 to 24.287 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, or, pursuant to subsection (17), as a result of a general rate case. Any order incorporating a gas cost recovery clause shall replace and rescind any previous purchased gas adjustment clause incorporated in the rates of the utility upon the effective date of the first gas cost recovery factor authorized for the utility under its gas cost recovery clause.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In order to implement the gas cost recovery clause established pursuant to subsection (2), a utility annually shall file, pursuant to procedures established by the commission, if any, a complete gas cost recovery plan describing the expected sources and volumes of its gas supply and changes in the cost of gas anticipated over a future 12-month period specified by the commission and requesting for each of those 12 months a specific gas cost recovery factor. The plan shall be filed not less than 3 months before the beginning of the 12-month period covered by the plan. The plan shall describe all major contracts and gas supply arrangements entered into by the utility for obtaining gas during the specified 12-month period. The description of the major contracts and arrangements shall include the price of the gas, the duration of the contract or arrangement, and an explanation or description of any other term or provision as required by the commission. The plan shall also include the gas utility's evaluation of the reasonableness and prudence of its decisions to obtain gas in the manner described in the plan, in light of the major alternative gas supplies available to the utility, and an explanation of the legal and regulatory actions taken by the utility to minimize the cost of gas purchased by the utility.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In order to implement the gas cost recovery clause established pursuant to subsection (2), a gas utility shall file, contemporaneously with the gas cost recovery plan described in subsection (3), a 5-year forecast of the gas requirements of its customers, its anticipated sources of supply, and projections of gas costs. The forecast shall include a description of all relevant major contracts and gas supply arrangements entered into or contemplated between the gas utility and its suppliers, a description of all major gas supply arrangements which the gas utility knows have been, or expects will be, entered into between the gas utility's principal pipeline suppliers and their major sources of gas, and such other information as the commission may require.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a utility files a gas cost recovery plan and a 5-year forecast as provided in subsections (3) and (4), the commission shall conduct a proceeding, to be known as a gas supply and cost review, for the purpose of evaluating the reasonableness and prudence of the plan, and establishing the gas cost recovery factors to implement a gas cost recovery clause incorporated in the rates or rate schedule of the gas utility. The gas supply and cost review shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   In its final order in a gas supply and cost review, the commission shall evaluate the reasonableness and prudence of the decisions underlying the gas cost recovery plan filed by the gas utility pursuant to subsection (3), and shall approve, disapprove, or amend the gas cost recovery plan accordingly. In evaluating the decisions underlying the gas cost recovery plan, the commission shall consider the volume, cost, and reliability of the major alternative gas supplies available to the utility; the cost of alternative fuels available to some or all of the utility's customers; the availability of gas in storage; the ability of the utility to reduce or to eliminate any sales to out-of-state customers; whether the utility has taken all appropriate legal and regulatory actions to minimize the cost of purchased gas; and other relevant factors. The commission shall approve, reject, or amend the 12 monthly gas cost recovery factors requested by the utility in its gas cost recovery plan. The factors ordered shall be described in fixed dollar amounts per unit of gas, but may include specific amounts contingent on future events, including proceedings of the federal energy regulatory commission or its successor agency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   In its final order in a gas supply and cost review, the commission shall evaluate the decisions underlying the 5-year forecast filed by a gas utility pursuant to subsection (4). The commission may also indicate any cost items in the 5-year forecast that on the basis of present evidence, the commission would be unlikely to permit the gas utility to recover from its customers in rates, rate schedules, or gas cost recovery factors established in the future.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The commission, on its own motion or the motion of any party, may make a finding and enter a temporary order granting approval or partial approval of a gas cost recovery plan in a gas supply and cost recovery review, after first having given notice to the parties to the review, and after having afforded to the parties to the review a reasonable opportunity for a full and complete hearing. A temporary order made pursuant to this subsection shall be considered a final order for purposes of judicial review.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   If the commission has made a final or temporary order in a gas supply and cost review, the utility may each month incorporate in its rates for the period covered by the order any amounts up to the gas cost recovery factors permitted in that order. If the commission has not made a final or temporary order within 3 months of the submission of a complete gas cost recovery plan, or by the beginning of the period covered in the plan, whichever comes later, or if a temporary order has expired without being extended or replaced, then pending an order which determines the gas cost recovery factors, a gas utility may each month adjust its rates to incorporate all or a part of the gas cost recovery factors requested in its plan. Any amounts collected under the gas cost recovery factors before the commission makes its final order shall be subject to prompt refund with interest to the extent that the total amounts collected exceed the total amounts determined in the commission's final order to be reasonable and prudent for the same period of time.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   Not less than 3 months before the beginning of the third quarter of the 12-month period, the utility may file a revised gas cost recovery plan which shall cover the remainder of the 12-month period. Upon receipt of the revised gas cost recovery plan, the commission shall reopen the gas supply and cost review. In addition, the commission may reopen the gas supply and cost review on its own motion or on the showing of good cause by any party if at least 6 months have elapsed since the utility submitted its complete filing and if there are at least 60 days remaining in the 12-month period under consideration. A reopened gas supply and cost review shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, and in accordance with subsections (3), (6), (8), and (9).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   Not more than 45 days following the last day of each billing month in which a gas cost recovery factor has been applied to customers' bills, the gas utility shall file with the commission a detailed statement for that month of the revenues recorded pursuant to the gas cost recovery factor and the allowance for cost of gas included in the base rates established in the latest commission order for the gas utility, and the cost of gas sold. The detailed statement shall be in the manner and form prescribed by the commission. The commission shall establish procedures for insuring that the detailed statement is promptly verified and corrected if necessary.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   Not less than once a year, and not later than 3 months after the end of the 12-month period covered by a gas utility's gas cost recovery plan, the commission shall commence a proceeding, to be known as a gas cost reconciliation, as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969. Reasonable discovery shall be permitted before and during the reconciliation proceeding in order to assist parties and interested persons in obtaining evidence concerning reconciliation issues including, but not limited to, the reasonableness and prudence of expenditures and the amounts collected pursuant to the clause. At the gas cost reconciliation the commission shall reconcile the revenues recorded pursuant to the gas cost recovery factor and the allowance for cost of gas included in the base rates established in the latest commission order for the gas utility with the amounts actually expensed and included in the cost of gas sold by the gas utility. The commission shall consider any issue regarding the reasonableness and prudence of expenses for which customers were charged if the issue could not have been considered adequately at a previously conducted gas supply and cost review.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   In its order in a gas cost reconciliation, the commission shall require a gas utility to refund to customers or credit to customers' bills any net amount determined to have been recovered over the period covered in excess of the amounts determined to have been actually expensed by the utility for gas sold, and to have been incurred through reasonable and prudent actions not precluded by the commission order in the gas supply and cost review. Such refunds or credits shall be apportioned among the customers of the utility utilizing procedures that the commission determines to be reasonable. The commission may adopt different procedures with respect to customers served under the various rate schedules of the utility and may, in appropriate circumstances, order refunds or credits in proportion to the excess amounts actually collected from each such customer during the period covered.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(14)   In its order in a gas cost reconciliation, the commission shall authorize a gas utility to recover from customers any net amount by which the amount determined to have been recovered over the period covered was less than the amount determined to have been actually expensed by the utility for gas sold, and to have been incurred through reasonable and prudent actions not precluded by the commission order in the gas supply and cost review. For excess costs incurred through actions contrary to the commission's gas supply and cost review order, the commission shall authorize a utility to recover costs incurred for gas sold in the 12-month period in excess of the amount recovered over the period only if the utility demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the excess expenses were beyond the ability of the utility to control through reasonable and prudent actions. For excess costs incurred through actions consistent with commission's gas supply and cost review order, the commission shall authorize a utility to recover costs incurred for gas sold in the 12-month period in excess of the amount recovered over the period only if the utility demonstrates that the excess expenses were reasonable and prudent. Such amounts in excess of the amounts actually recovered by the utility for gas sold shall be apportioned among and charged to the customers of the utility utilizing procedures that the commission determines to be reasonable. The commission may adopt different procedures with respect to customers served under the various rate schedules of the utility and may, in appropriate circumstances, order charges to be made in proportion to the amounts which would have been paid by such customers if the amounts in excess of the amounts actually recovered by the utility for gas sold had been included in the gas cost recovery factors with respect to such customers during the period covered. Charges for such excess amounts shall be spread over a period that the commission determines to be appropriate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(15)   If the commission orders refunds or credits pursuant to subsection (13), or additional charges to customers pursuant to subsection (14), in its final order in a gas cost reconciliation, the refunds, credits, or additional charges shall include interest and shall be apportioned among the utility's customer classes in proportion to their respective usage during the reconciliation period. In determining the interest included in a refund, credit, or additional charge pursuant to this subsection, the commission shall consider, to the extent material and practicable, the time at which the excess recoveries or insufficient recoveries, or both, occurred. The commission shall determine a rate of interest for excess recoveries, refunds, and credits equal to the greater of the average short-term borrowing rate available to the gas utility during the appropriate period, or the authorized rate of return on the common stock of the gas utility during that same period. The commission shall determine a rate of interest for insufficient recoveries and additional charges equal to the average short-term borrowing rate available to the gas utility during the appropriate period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(16)   To avoid undue hardship or unduly burdensome or excessive cost, the commission may exempt a gas utility with fewer than 200,000 customers in the state of Michigan from 1 or more of the procedural provisions of this section or may modify the filing requirements of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(17)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the commission may, upon application by a gas utility, set gas cost recovery factors, in a manner otherwise consistent with this act, in an order resulting from a general rate case. Within 120 days following the effective date of this section, for the purpose of setting gas cost recovery factors, the commission shall permit a gas utility to reopen a general rate case in which a final order was issued within 120 days before or after the effective date of this section or to amend an application or reopen the evidentiary record in a pending general rate case. If the commission sets gas cost recovery factors in an order resulting from a general rate case:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The gas cost recovery factors shall cover a future period of 48 months or the number of months which elapse until the commission orders new gas cost recovery factors in a general rate case, whichever is the shorter period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Annual reconciliation proceedings shall be conducted pursuant to subsection (12) and if an annual reconciliation proceeding shows a recoverable amount pursuant to subsection (14), the commission shall authorize the gas utility to defer the amount and to accumulate interest on the amount pursuant to subsection (15), and in the next order resulting from a general rate case authorize the utility to recover the amount and interest from its customers in the manner provided in subsection (14).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The gas cost recovery factors shall not be subject to revision pursuant to subsection (10).</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As used in this act:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Long-term firm gas transportation" means a binding agreement entered into between the electric utility and a natural gas transmission provider for a set period of time to provide firm delivery of natural gas to an electric generation facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Power supply cost recovery clause" means a clause in the electric rates or rate schedule of an electric utility that permits the monthly adjustment of rates for power supply to allow the utility to recover the booked costs, including transportation costs, reclamation costs, and disposal and reprocessing costs, of fuel burned by the utility for electric generation and the booked costs of purchased and net interchanged power transactions by the utility incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Power supply cost recovery factor" means that element of the rates to be charged for electric service to reflect power supply costs incurred by an electric utility and made pursuant to a power supply cost recovery clause incorporated in the rates or rate schedule of an electric utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The public service commission may incorporate a power supply cost recovery clause in the electric rates or rate schedule of an electric utility. Any order incorporating a power supply cost recovery clause shall be as a result of a hearing solely on the question of the inclusion of the clause in the rates or rate schedule. A hearing under this subsection shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287, or, pursuant to subsection (18), as a result of a general rate case. Any order incorporating a power supply cost recovery clause shall replace and rescind any previous fuel cost adjustment clause or purchased and net interchanged power adjustment clause incorporated in the electric rates of the utility upon the effective date of the first power supply cost recovery factor authorized for the utility under its power supply cost recovery clause.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In order to implement the power supply cost recovery clause established under subsection (2), an electric utility annually shall file, pursuant to procedures established by the commission, if any, a complete power supply cost recovery plan describing the expected sources of electric power supply and changes in the cost of power supply anticipated over a future 12-month period specified by the commission and requesting for each of those 12 months a specific power supply cost recovery factor. The utility shall file the plan not later than 3 months before the beginning of the 12-month period covered by the plan. The plan shall describe all major contracts and power supply arrangements entered into by the utility for providing power supply during the specified 12-month period. The description of the major contracts and arrangements shall include the price of fuel, the duration of the contract or arrangement, and an explanation or description of any other term or provision as required by the commission. For gas fuel supply contracts or arrangements, the description shall include whether the supply contracts or arrangements include long-term firm gas transportation and, if not, an explanation of how the utility proposes to ensure reliable and reasonably priced gas fuel supply to its generation facilities during the specified 12-month period. The plan shall also include the utility's evaluation of the reasonableness and prudence of its decisions to provide power supply in the manner described in the plan, in light of its existing sources of electrical generation, and an explanation of the actions taken by the utility to minimize the cost of fuel to the utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In order to implement the power supply cost recovery clause established under subsection (2), a utility shall file, contemporaneously with the power supply cost recovery plan required by subsection (3), a 5-year forecast of the power supply requirements of its customers, its anticipated sources of supply, and projections of power supply costs, in light of its existing sources of electrical generation and sources of electrical generation under construction. The forecast shall include a description of all relevant major contracts and power supply arrangements entered into or contemplated by the utility, and any other information the commission may require.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If an electric utility files a power supply cost recovery plan under subsection (3) and a 5-year forecast under subsection (4), the commission shall conduct a proceeding, to be known as a power supply and cost review, for the purpose of evaluating the reasonableness and prudence of the power supply cost recovery plan filed by a utility under subsection (3), and establishing the power supply cost recovery factors to implement a power supply cost recovery clause incorporated in the electric rates or rate schedule of the utility. The power supply and cost review shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) In its final order in a power supply and cost review, the commission shall evaluate the reasonableness and prudence of the decisions underlying the power supply cost recovery plan filed by an electric utility under subsection (3), and shall approve, disapprove, or amend the power supply cost recovery plan accordingly. In evaluating the decisions underlying the power supply cost recovery plan, the commission shall consider the cost and availability of the electrical generation available to the utility; the cost of short-term firm purchases available to the utility; the availability of interruptible service; the ability of the utility to reduce or to eliminate any firm sales to out-of-state customers if the utility is not a multi-state utility whose firm sales are subject to other regulatory authority; whether the utility has taken all appropriate actions to minimize the cost of fuel; and other relevant factors. The commission shall approve, reject, or amend the 12 monthly power supply cost recovery factors requested by the utility in its power supply cost recovery plan. The factors shall not reflect items the commission could reasonably anticipate would be disallowed under subsection (13). The factors ordered shall be described in fixed dollar amounts per unit of electricity, but may include specific amounts contingent on future events.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) In its final order in a power supply and cost review, the commission shall evaluate the decisions underlying the 5-year forecast filed by a utility under subsection (4). The commission may also indicate any cost items in the 5-year forecast that, on the basis of present evidence, the commission would be unlikely to permit the utility to recover from its customers in rates, rate schedules, or power supply cost recovery factors established in the future.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The commission, on its own motion or the motion of any party, may make a finding and enter a temporary order granting approval or partial approval of a power supply cost recovery plan in a power supply and cost recovery review, after first giving notice to the parties to the review, and after giving the parties to the review a reasonable opportunity for a full and complete hearing. A temporary order made under this subsection is considered a final order for purposes of judicial review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the commission has made a final or temporary order in a power supply and cost review, an electric utility may each month incorporate in its rates for the period covered by the order any amounts up to the power supply cost recovery factors permitted in that order. If the commission has not made a final or temporary order within 3 months after the submission of a complete power supply cost recovery plan, or by the beginning of the period covered in the plan, whichever comes later, or if a temporary order has expired without being extended or replaced, then pending an order that determines the power supply cost recovery factors, a utility may each month adjust its rates to incorporate all or a part of the power supply cost recovery factors requested in its plan. Any amounts collected under the power supply cost recovery factors before the commission makes its final order is subject to prompt refund with interest to the extent that the total amounts collected exceed the total amounts determined in the commission's final order to be reasonable and prudent for the same period of time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Not later than 3 months before the beginning of the third quarter of the 12-month period described in subsection (3), an electric utility may file a revised power supply cost recovery plan that covers the remainder of the 12-month period. Upon receipt of the revised power supply cost recovery plan, the commission shall reopen the power supply and cost review. In addition, the commission may reopen the power supply and cost review on its own motion or on the showing of good cause by any party if at least 6 months have elapsed since the utility submitted its complete filing and if there are at least 60 days remaining in the 12-month period under consideration. A reopened power supply and cost review shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287, and in accordance with subsections (3), (6), (8), and (9).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Not later than 45 days after the last day of each billing month in which a power supply cost recovery factor has been applied to customers' bills, an electric utility shall file with the commission a detailed statement for that month of the revenues recorded pursuant to the power supply cost recovery factor and the allowance for cost of power supply included in the base rates established in the latest commission order for the utility, and the cost of power supply. The detailed statement shall be in the manner and form prescribed by the commission. The commission shall establish procedures for insuring that the detailed statement is promptly verified and corrected if necessary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Not less than once a year, and not later than 3 months after the end of the 12-month period covered by an electric utility's power supply cost recovery plan, the commission shall commence a proceeding, to be known as a power supply cost reconciliation, as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287. The commission shall permit reasonable discovery before and during the reconciliation proceeding in order to assist parties and interested persons in obtaining evidence concerning reconciliation issues including, but not limited to, the reasonableness and prudence of expenditures and the amounts collected pursuant to the clause. At the power supply cost reconciliation the commission shall reconcile the revenues recorded pursuant to the power supply cost recovery factors and the allowance for cost of power supply included in the base rates established in the latest commission order for the utility with the amounts actually expensed and included in the cost of power supply by the utility. The commission shall consider any issue regarding the reasonableness and prudence of expenses for which customers were charged if the issue was not considered adequately at a previously conducted power supply and cost review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) In its order in a power supply cost reconciliation, the commission shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Disallow cost increases resulting from changes in accounting or rate-making expense treatment not previously approved by the commission. The commission may order the utility to pay a penalty of not more than 25% of the amount improperly collected. Costs incurred by the utility for penalty payments shall not be charged to customers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Not disallow the capacity charges for any facilities for which the electric utility would otherwise have a purchase obligation if the commission has approved capacity charges in a contract with a qualifying facility, as that term is defined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pursuant to the public utilities regulatory policies act of 1978, Public Law 95-617, 92 Stat 3117, unless the commission has ordered revised capacity charges upon reconsideration under this subsection. A contract is valid and binding in accordance with its terms, and capacity charges paid pursuant to that contract are recoverable costs of the utility for rate-making purposes notwithstanding that the order approving that contract is later vacated, modified, or otherwise held to be invalid in whole or in part if the order approving the contract has not been stayed or suspended by a competent court within 30 days after the date of the order, or by July 29, 1987 if the order was issued after September 1, 1986 and before June 29, 1987. The commission shall determine the scope and manner of the review of capacity charges for a qualifying facility. Except as to approvals for qualifying facilities granted by the commission before June 1, 1987, proceedings before the commission seeking those approvals shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287. The commission, upon its own motion or upon application of any person, may reconsider its approval of capacity charges for a qualifying facility in a contested case hearing after passage of a period necessary for financing the qualifying facility, if both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The commission has first issued an order making a finding based on evidence presented in a contested case that there has been a substantial change in circumstances since the commission's initial approval. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The commission finding is set forth in a commission order subject to immediate judicial review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The financing period for a qualifying facility during which previously approved capacity charges are not subject to commission reconsideration is 17.5 years, beginning with the date of commercial operation, for all qualifying facilities, except that the minimum financing period before reconsideration of the previously approved capacity charges is for the duration of the financing for a qualifying facility that produces electric energy by the use of biomass, waste, wood, hydroelectric, wind, and other renewable resources, or any combination of renewable resources, as the primary energy source.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Disallow net increased costs attributable to a generating plant outage of more than 90 days in duration unless the utility demonstrates by clear and satisfactory evidence that the outage, or any part of the outage, was not caused or prolonged by the utility's negligence or by unreasonable or imprudent management.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Disallow transportation costs attributable to capital investments to develop a utility's capability to transport fuel or relocate fuel at the utility's facilities and disallow unloading and handling expenses incurred after receipt of fuel by the utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Disallow the cost of fuel purchased from an affiliated company to the extent that the fuel is more costly than fuel of requisite quality available at or about the same time from other suppliers with whom it would be comparably cost beneficial to deal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Disallow charges unreasonably or imprudently incurred for fuel not taken.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Disallow additional costs resulting from unreasonably or imprudently renegotiated fuel contracts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Disallow penalty charges unreasonably or imprudently incurred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Disallow demurrage charges.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Disallow increases in charges for nuclear fuel disposal unless the utility has received the prior approval of the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) In its order in a power supply cost reconciliation, the commission shall require an electric utility to refund to customers or credit to customers' bills any net amount determined to have been recovered over the period covered in excess of the amounts determined to have been actually expensed by the utility for power supply, and to have been incurred through reasonable and prudent actions not precluded by the commission order in the power supply and cost review. The commission shall apportion the refunds or credits among the customers of the utility utilizing procedures that the commission determines to be reasonable. The commission may adopt different procedures with respect to customers served under the various rate schedules of the utility and may, in appropriate circumstances, order refunds or credits in proportion to the excess amounts actually collected from each such customer during the period covered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) In its order in a power supply cost reconciliation, the commission shall authorize an electric utility to recover from customers any net amount by which the amount determined to have been recovered over the period covered was less than the amount determined to have been actually expensed by the utility for power supply, and to have been incurred through reasonable and prudent actions not precluded by the commission order in the power supply and cost review. For excess costs incurred through management actions contrary to the commission's power supply and cost review order, the commission shall authorize a utility to recover costs incurred for power supply in the reconciliation period in excess of the amount recovered over the period only if the utility demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the excess expenses were beyond the ability of the utility to control through reasonable and prudent actions. For excess costs incurred through management actions consistent with the commission's power supply and cost review order, the commission shall authorize a utility to recover costs incurred for power supply in the reconciliation period in excess of the amount recovered over the period only if the utility demonstrates that the level of those expenses resulted from reasonable and prudent management actions. The amounts in excess of the amounts actually recovered by the utility for power supply shall be apportioned among and charged to the customers of the utility utilizing procedures that the commission determines to be reasonable. The commission may adopt different procedures with respect to customers served under the various rate schedules of the utility and may, in appropriate circumstances, order charges to be made in proportion to the amounts that would have been paid by those customers if the amounts in excess of the amounts actually recovered by the utility for cost of power supply had been included in the power supply cost recovery factors with respect to those customers during the period covered. Charges for the excess amounts shall be spread over a period that the commission determines to be appropriate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) If the commission orders refunds or credits under subsection (14), or additional charges to customers under subsection (15), in its final order in a power supply cost reconciliation, the refunds, credits, or additional charges shall include interest. In determining the interest included in a refund, credit, or additional charge under this subsection, the commission shall consider, to the extent material and practicable, the time at which the excess recoveries or insufficient recoveries, or both occurred. The commission shall determine a rate of interest for excess recoveries, refunds, and credits equal to the greater of the average short-term borrowing rate available to the utility during the appropriate period, or the authorized rate of return on the common stock of the utility during that same period. Costs incurred by the utility for refunds and interest on refunds shall not be charged to customers. The commission shall determine a rate of interest for insufficient recoveries and additional charges equal to the average short-term borrowing rate available to the utility during the appropriate period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) To avoid undue hardship or unduly burdensome or excessive cost, the commission may do both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Exempt an electric utility with fewer than 200,000 customers in this state from 1 or more of the procedural provisions of this section or may modify the filing requirements of this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Exempt an energy utility organized as a cooperative corporation under sections 98 to 109 of 1931 PA 327, MCL 450.98 to 450.109, from 1 or more of the provisions of this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the commission may, upon application by an electric utility, set power supply cost recovery factors, in a manner otherwise consistent with this act, in an order resulting from a general rate case. By October 27, 1987, for the purpose of setting power supply cost recovery factors, the commission shall permit an electric utility to reopen a general rate case in which a final order was issued within 120 days before or after June 29, 1987 or to amend an application or reopen the evidentiary record in a pending general rate case. If the commission sets power supply cost recovery factors in an order resulting from a general rate case, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The power supply cost recovery factors shall cover a future period of 48 months or the number of months that elapse until the commission orders new power supply cost recovery factors in a general rate case, whichever is the shorter period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The commission shall conduct annual reconciliation proceedings under subsection (12) and if an annual reconciliation proceeding shows a recoverable amount under subsection (15), the commission shall authorize the electric utility to defer the amount and to accumulate interest on the amount under subsection (16), and in the next order resulting from a general rate case authorize the utility to recover the amount and interest from its customers in the manner provided in subsection (15).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The power supply cost recovery factors are not subject to revision under subsection (10).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The initial power supply cost recovery plan may be for a period of less than 12 months and shall be filed as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) By an electric utility subject to commission rate jurisdiction with at least 200,000 residential customers in the state of Michigan, by February 13, 1983.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) By all other electric utilities subject to commission rate jurisdiction, by January 13, 1984 in accordance with the provisions of this act which the commission determines to be appropriate for the individual utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Notwithstanding section 6a(5), until the expiration of 3 months plus the remainder of the then current billing month following the last day on which a utility is required to file its first power supply cost recovery plan under subsection (2), the utility may alter its rate schedule in accordance with an existing fuel cost adjustment clause or purchased and net interchanged power adjustment clause. Thereafter, the utility may make charges in excess of base rates for the cost of power supply pursuant only to subsections (2) and (4). After October 13, 1982, any revenues resulting from an existing fuel cost adjustment clause or purchased and net interchanged power adjustment clause and recorded for an annual reconciliation period ending before January 1, 1983, by an electric utility are subject to the existing reconciliation proceeding established by the commission for the utility. In this proceeding, the commission shall consider the reasonableness and prudence of expenditures charged pursuant to an existing fuel cost adjustment clause or purchased and net interchanged power adjustment clause after October 13, 1982. On and after January 1, 1983, all fuel cost and purchased and net interchanged power revenues received by an electric utility, whether included in base rates or collected pursuant to a fuel or purchased and net interchanged power adjustment clause or a power supply cost recovery clause, are subject to annual reconciliation with the cost of fuel and purchased and net interchanged power. The annual reconciliations shall be conducted in accordance with the reconciliation procedures described in section 6j(12) to (18), including the provisions for refunds, additional charges, deferral and recovery, and shall include consideration by the commission of the reasonableness and prudence of expenditures charged pursuant to any fuel or purchased and net interchanged power adjustment clause in existence during the period being reconciled. If the utility has a lag correction provision included in its existing adjustment clauses, the commission shall allow any adjustment to rates attributable to that lag correction provision to be implemented for the 3 billing months immediately succeeding the final billing month in which the existing adjustment clauses as operative.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The utility consumer representation fund is created as a special fund. The state treasurer is the custodian of the fund and shall maintain a separate account of the money in the fund. The money in the fund must be invested in the bonds, notes, and other evidences of indebtedness issued or insured by the United States government and its agencies, and in prime commercial paper. The state treasurer shall release money from the fund, including interest earned, in the manner and at the time directed by the board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as provided in subsection (5), each energy utility that has applied to the commission for the initiation of an energy cost recovery proceeding shall remit to the fund before or upon filing its initial application for that proceeding, and on or before the first anniversary of that application, an amount of money determined by the board in the following manner:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) In the case of an energy utility company serving at least 100,000 customers in this state, its proportional share of $1,800,000.00 adjusted annually by a factor as provided in subsection (4). This adjusted amount is the new base amount to which the factor provided in subsection (4) is applied in the succeeding year. A utility's proportional share must be calculated by dividing the company's jurisdictional total operating revenues for the preceding year, as stated in its annual report, by the total operating revenues for the preceding year of all energy utility companies serving at least 100,000 customers in this state. The board shall make this amount available for use by the attorney general for the purposes described in subsection (16).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) In the case of an energy utility company serving at least 100,000 residential customers in this state, its proportional share of $2,000,000.00 adjusted annually by a factor as provided in subsection (4). This adjusted amount is the new base amount to which the factor provided in subsection (4) is applied in the succeeding year. A utility's proportional share must be calculated by dividing the company's jurisdictional gross revenues from residential tariff sales for the preceding year by the gross revenues from residential tariff sales for the preceding year of all energy utility companies serving at least 100,000 residential customers in this state. This amount must be used for grants under subsection (10).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) In the case of an energy utility company serving fewer than 100,000 customers in this state, its proportional share of $100,000.00 adjusted annually by a factor as provided in subsection (4). This adjusted amount is the new base amount to which the factor provided in subsection (4) is applied in the succeeding year. A utility's proportional share must be calculated by dividing the company's jurisdictional total operating revenues for the preceding year, as stated in its annual report, by the total operating revenues for the preceding year of all energy utility companies serving fewer than 100,000 customers in this state. The board shall make this amount available for use by the attorney general for the purposes described in subsection (16).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) In the case of an energy utility company serving fewer than 100,000 residential customers in this state, its proportional share of $100,000.00 adjusted annually by a factor as provided in subsection (4). This adjusted amount is the new base amount to which the factor provided in subsection (4) is applied in the succeeding year. A utility's proportional share must be calculated by dividing the company's jurisdictional gross revenues from residential tariff sales for the preceding year by the gross revenues from residential tariff sales for the preceding year of all energy utility companies serving fewer than 100,000 residential customers in this state. This amount must be used for grants under subsection (10).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Payments made by an energy utility under subsection (2)(a) or (c) are operating expenses of the utility that the commission shall permit the utility to charge to its customers. Payments made by a utility under subsection (2)(b) or (d) are operating expenses of the utility that the commission shall permit the utility to charge to its residential customers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) For purposes of subsection (2), the board shall set the factor at a level not to exceed the percentage increase in the index known as the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, select areas, all items indexed, for the Detroit standard metropolitan statistical area, compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor, or any successor agency, that has occurred between January of the preceding year and January of the year in which the payment is required to be made. In the event that more than 1 such index is compiled, the index yielding the largest payment is the maximum allowable factor. The board shall advise utilities of the factor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The remittance requirements of this section do not apply to an energy utility organized as a cooperative corporation under sections 98 to 109 of 1931 PA 327, MCL 450.98 to 450.109, and grants from the fund must not be used to participate in an energy cost recovery proceeding primarily affecting such a utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) In the event of a dispute between the board and an energy utility about the amount of payment due, the utility shall pay the undisputed amount and, if the utility and the board cannot agree, the board may initiate civil action in the circuit court for Ingham County for recovery of the disputed amount. The commission shall not accept or take action on an application for an energy cost recovery proceeding from an energy utility subject to this section that has not fully paid undisputed remittances required by this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The commission shall not accept or take action on an application for an energy cost recovery proceeding from an energy utility subject to this section until 30 days after it has been notified by the board that the board is ready to process grant applications, will transfer funds payable to the attorney general immediately upon the receipt of those funds, and will within 30 days approve grants and remit funds to qualified grant applicants.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The board may accept a gift or grant from any source to be deposited in the fund if the conditions or purposes of the gift or grant are consistent with this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The costs of operation and expenses incurred by the board in performing its duties under this section and section 6l, including remuneration to board members, must be paid from the fund. A maximum of 5% of the annual receipts of the fund may be budgeted and used to pay expenses other than grants made under subsection (10).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The net grant proceeds must finance a grant program from which the board may award to an applicant an amount that the board determines shall be used for the purposes set forth in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The board shall create and make available to applicants an application form. Each applicant shall indicate on the application how the applicant meets the eligibility requirements provided for in this section and how the applicant proposes to use a grant from the fund to participate in 1 or more proceedings as authorized in subsection (16) that have been or are expected to be filed. Each applicant shall also identify on the application any additional funds or resources, other than the grant funds being requested, that are to be used to participate in the proceeding for which the grant is being requested and how those funds or resources will be utilized. The board shall receive an application requesting a grant from the fund only from a nonprofit organization or a unit of local government in this state. The board shall consider only applications for grants containing proposals that are consistent with subsections (16) and (17) and that serve the interests of residential utility consumers. The interest of residential consumers includes, but is not limited to, considerations of utility service in this state; the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the utility sector; and the protection of public health, equitable access to energy efficiency, weatherization, efficient electrification measures, programs and services, and clean energy technologies. For purposes of making grants, the board may consider energy conservation, energy waste reduction, demand response, and rate design options to encourage energy conservation, energy waste reduction, and demand response, as well as the maintenance of adequate energy resources. The board shall not consider an application that primarily benefits the applicant or a service provided or administered by the applicant. The board shall not consider an application from a nonprofit organization if 1 of the organization's principal interests or unifying principles is the welfare of a utility or its investors or employees, or the welfare of 1 or more businesses or industries, other than farms not owned or operated by a corporation, that receive utility service ordinarily and primarily for use in connection with the profit-seeking manufacture, sale, or distribution of goods or services. Mere ownership of securities by a nonprofit organization or its members does not disqualify an application submitted by that organization.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The board shall encourage grant making to nonprofits representing environmental justice communities and communities with the highest energy burdens. The board shall also encourage the interests of identifiable types of residential utility consumers whose interests may differ, including various social and economic classes and areas of the state, and if necessary, may make grants to more than 1 applicant whose applications are related to a similar issue to achieve this type of representation. In addition, the board shall consider and balance the following criteria in determining whether to make a grant to an applicant:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Evidence of the applicant's competence, experience, and commitment to advancing the interests of residential utility consumers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The anticipated involvement of the attorney general in a proceeding and whether activities of the applicant will be duplicative or supplemental to those of the attorney general.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) In the case of a nongovernmental applicant, the extent to which the applicant is representative of or has a previous history of advocating the interests of citizens, especially residential utility consumers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The anticipated effect of the proposal contained in the application on residential utility consumers, including the immediate and long-term impacts of the proposal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Evidence demonstrating the potential for continuity of effort and the development of expertise in relation to the proposal contained in the application.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The uniqueness or innovativeness of an applicant's position or point of view as it relates to advocating for residential utility consumers concerning energy costs or rates, and the probability and desirability of that position or point of view prevailing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) As an alternative to choosing between 2 or more applications that have similar proposals, the board may invite 2 or more of the applicants to file jointly and award a grant to be managed cooperatively.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) The board shall make disbursements pursuant to a grant in advance of an applicant's proposed actions as set forth in the application if necessary to enable the applicant to initiate, continue, or complete the proposed actions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) Any notice to utility customers and the general public of hearings or other state proceedings in which grants from the fund may be used must contain a notice of the availability of the fund and the address of the board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) The annual receipts and interest earned, less administrative costs, may be used only for participation in administrative and judicial proceedings under sections 6a, 6h, 6j, 6s, 6t, 6w, and 10i, and the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1001 to 460.1211, and in federal administrative and judicial proceedings that directly affect the energy costs or rates paid by energy utility customers in this state. Amounts that have been in the fund more than 12 months may be retained in the fund for future proceedings and any unexpended money in the fund is reserved to fulfill the purposes for which it was appropriated or may be returned to energy utility companies or used to offset their future remittances in proportion to their previous remittances to the fund, as the board and attorney general determine will best serve the interests of consumers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) The following conditions apply to all grants from the fund:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Disbursements from the fund may be used only to advocate the interests of residential energy utility customers concerning energy costs or rates and not for representation of merely individual interests.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The board shall attempt to maintain a reasonable relationship between the payments from a particular energy utility and the benefits to consumers of that utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The board shall coordinate the funded activities of grant recipients with those of the attorney general to avoid duplication of effort, particularly as it relates to the hiring of expert witnesses, to promote supplementation of effort, and to maximize the number of hearings and proceedings with intervenor participation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) A recipient of a grant under subsection (10) may use the grant only for the advancement of the proposed action approved by the board, including, but not limited to, costs of staff, hired consultants and counsel, and research.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) A recipient of a grant under subsection (10) shall prepare for and participate in all discussions among the parties designed to facilitate settlement or narrowing of the contested issues before a hearing in order to minimize litigation costs for all parties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) A recipient of a grant under subsection (10) shall file a report with the board not later than 90 days following the end of the year or a shorter period for which the grant is made. The report must be made in a form prescribed by the board and is subject to audit by the board. The board shall include each report received under this subsection as part of the board's annual report required under subsection (22). The report under this subsection must include the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An account of all grant expenditures made by the grant recipient. Expenditures must be reported within the following categories:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Employee and contract for services costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Costs of materials and supplies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Filing fees and other costs required to effectively represent residential utility consumers as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A detailed list of the regulatory issues raised by the grant recipient and how each issue was determined by the commission, court, or other tribunal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Any additional information concerning uses of the grant required by the board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) On or before July 1 of each year, the attorney general shall file a report with the house and senate committees on appropriations and the house and senate committees with jurisdiction over energy and utility policy issues.

</P>
<P>Sec. 6o.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   As used in this section:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Resource recovery facility" means a facility that meets all of the following requirements:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Has machinery, equipment, and structures installed for the primary purpose of recovering energy through the incineration of qualified solid waste, qualified landfill gas, or scrap tires.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Utilizes at least 80% of its total annual fuel input in the form of qualified solid waste, at least 90% of its total annual fuel input in the form of qualified landfill gas, or 90% of its total annual fuel input in the form of scrap tires, exclusive of fuel used for normal start-up and shutdown.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   Is a qualifying facility as defined by the federal energy regulatory commission pursuant to the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978, Public Law 95-617, 92 Stat. 3117.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Qualified landfill gas" means gas reclaimed from a type II landfill as defined in R 299.4105 of the Michigan administrative code.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   "Qualified solid waste" means solid waste that may be lawfully disposed of in a type II landfill as defined in R 299.4105 of the Michigan administrative code, and which is generated within this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   "Scrap tire", "scrap tire hauler", and "scrap tire processor" mean those terms as they are defined in part 169 (scrap tires) of the natural resources and environmental protection act, Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.16901 to 324.16909 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Public utilities with more than 500,000 customers in this state shall enter into power purchase agreements for the purchase of capacity and energy from resource recovery facilities that incinerate qualified landfill gas; that incinerate qualified solid waste, at least 50.1% of which is generated within the service areas of the public utility; or, subject to the provisions of this section, that incinerate scrap tires, under rates, charges, terms, and conditions of service that, for these facilities, may differ from those negotiated, authorized, or prescribed for purchases from qualifying facilities that are not resource recovery facilities. If a resource recovery facility incinerates scrap tires, or any other tires that are obtained from outside the state, or if more than 50.1% of the scrap tires or other tires are obtained outside the public utility service area, the public utility may in partial satisfaction of its obligation under this subsection purchase capacity and energy from the facility but is not obligated by this act to purchase the facility's capacity and energy. A resource recovery facility that incinerates at least 90% of its total annual fuel input in the form of scrap tires shall accept all scrap tires that first became scrap tires in the state and that are delivered to the facility by a scrap tire processor or a scrap tire hauler. The first 6,000,000 of these scrap tires delivered to the resource recovery facility each year shall be charged a rate not greater than an amount equal to $34.50 per ton, increased each calendar quarter beginning July 1, 1990, by an amount equal to the increase in the all items version of the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers during the prior calendar quarter. Including power purchase agreements executed prior to June 30, 1989, this section does not apply after 120 megawatts of electric resource recovery facility capacity in a utility's service territory have been contracted and entered in commercial operation. Additionally, this section does not apply to more than the first 30 megawatts of scrap tire fueled resource recovery facility capacity in the state that has been contracted and entered in commercial operation. Excluding rate provisions, if 1 or more provisions of a purchase agreement remain in dispute, each party shall submit to the commission all of the purchase agreement provisions of their last best offer and a supporting brief. On each disputed provision, the commission shall within 60 days either select or reject with recommendation the offers submitted by either party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A power purchase agreement entered into by a public utility for the purchase of capacity and energy from a resource recovery facility shall be filed with the commission and a contested case proceeding shall commence immediately pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, being sections 24.271 to 24.287 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. Notwithstanding section 6j, a power purchase agreement shall be considered approved if the commission does not approve or disapprove the agreement within 6 months of the date of the filing of the agreement. Approval pursuant to this subsection constitutes prior approval under section 6j(13)(b).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The energy rate component of all power sales contracts for resource recovery facilities shall be equal to the avoided energy cost of the purchasing utility.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   When averaged over the term of the contract, the capacity rate component of all power sales contracts for resource recovery facilities may be equal to but not less than the full avoided cost of the utility as determined by the commission. In determining the capacity rate, the commission may assume that the utility needs capacity.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Capacity purchased by a utility prior to January 1, 2000 under a power sales contract with a resource recovery facility shall not be considered directly or indirectly in determining the utility's reserve margin, reserve capacity, or other resource capability measurement. To insure compliance with this act, a resource recovery facility that incinerates scrap tires shall provide an annual accounting to the legislature and the commission. The annual accounting shall include the total amount of scrap tires incinerated at the resource recovery facility and the percentage of those scrap tires that prior to incineration were used within this state for their original intended purpose.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Steam supply cost recovery clause" means a clause in the rates or rate schedule of a utility which permits the monthly adjustment of rates for steam supply to allow the utility to recover the booked costs of fuel burned by the utility for steam generation and the booked costs of purchased steam transactions by the utility incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Steam supply cost recovery factor" means that element of the rates to be charged for steam service to reflect steam supply costs incurred by a utility and made pursuant to a steam supply cost recovery clause incorporated in the rates or rate schedule of a utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Utility" means a steam distribution company regulated by the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Pursuant to its authority under this act, the commission may incorporate a steam supply cost recovery clause in the steam rates or rate schedule of a utility. An order incorporating a steam supply cost recovery clause shall be the result of a hearing solely on the question of the inclusion of the clause in the rates or rate schedule. The hearing shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In order to implement the steam supply cost recovery clause established pursuant to subsection (2), a utility annually shall file a complete steam supply cost recovery plan describing the expected sources of steam supply and changes in the cost of steam supply anticipated over a future 12-month period specified by the commission and requesting for each of those 12 months a specific steam supply cost recovery factor. The utility shall file the steam supply cost recovery plan at least 3 months before the beginning of the 12-month period covered by the plan. The plan shall describe all major contracts and steam supply arrangements entered into by the utility for providing steam supply during the specified 12-month period including the price of fuel, the duration of the contract or arrangement, and an explanation or description of any other term or provision of the contract or arrangement as required by the commission. The plan shall also include the utility's evaluation of the reasonableness and prudence of its decisions to provide steam supply in the manner described in the plan, in light of its existing sources of steam generation, and an explanation of the actions taken by the utility to minimize the cost of fuel to the utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In order to implement the steam supply cost recovery clause established pursuant to subsection (2), a utility shall file, contemporaneously with the steam supply cost recovery plan required by subsection (3), a 3-year forecast of the steam supply requirements of its customers, its anticipated sources of supply, and projections of steam supply costs, in light of its existing sources of steam generation and sources of steam generation under construction. The forecast shall include a description of all relevant major contracts and steam supply arrangements entered into or contemplated by the utility, and any other information the commission may require.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a utility files a steam supply cost recovery plan and a 3-year forecast as provided in subsections (3) and (4), the commission shall conduct a proceeding, to be known as a steam supply and cost review, to evaluate the reasonableness and prudence of the steam supply cost recovery plan filed by a utility pursuant to subsection (3), and establish the steam supply cost recovery factors to implement a steam supply cost recovery clause incorporated in the rates or rate schedule of the utility. The steam supply and cost review shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) In its final order in a steam supply and cost review, the commission shall evaluate the reasonableness and prudence of the decisions underlying the steam supply cost recovery plan filed by the utility pursuant to subsection (3), and shall approve, disapprove, or amend the steam supply cost recovery plan accordingly. In evaluating the decisions underlying the steam supply cost recovery plan, the commission shall consider the cost and availability of the steam generation available to the utility, the cost of short-term firm purchases available to the utility, whether the utility has taken all appropriate actions to minimize the cost of fuel, and other relevant factors. The commission shall approve, reject, or amend the 12 monthly steam supply cost recovery factors requested by the utility in its steam supply cost recovery plan. The factors ordered shall be described in fixed dollar amounts per unit of steam, but may include specific amounts contingent on future events.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) In its final order in a steam supply and cost review, the commission shall evaluate the decisions underlying the 3-year forecast filed by a utility pursuant to subsection (4). The commission may also indicate any cost items in the 3-year forecast that, on the basis of present evidence, the commission would be unlikely to permit the utility to recover from its customers in rates, rate schedules, or steam supply cost recovery factors established in the future.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The commission, on its own motion or the motion of any party, may make a finding and enter a temporary order granting approval or partial approval of a steam supply cost recovery plan in a steam supply and cost recovery review after first having given notice to the parties to the review and giving those parties a reasonable opportunity for a full and complete hearing. A temporary order made pursuant to this subsection is considered a final order for purposes of judicial review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the commission has made a final or temporary order in a steam supply and cost review, the utility may each month incorporate in its rates for the period covered by the order any amount up to the steam supply cost recovery factors permitted in that order. If the commission has not made a final or temporary order within 3 months of the submission of a complete steam supply cost recovery plan, or by the beginning of the period covered in the plan, whichever comes later, or if a temporary order has expired without being extended or replaced, then, pending an order which determines the steam supply cost recovery factors, a utility may each month adjust its rates to incorporate all or a part of the steam supply cost recovery factors requested in its plan. Any amount collected under the steam supply cost recovery factors before the commission makes its final order shall be subject to prompt refund with interest to the extent that the total amount collected exceeds the total amount determined in the commission's final order to be reasonable and prudent for the same period of time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Not less than 3 months before the beginning of the third quarter of the 12-month period, a utility may file a revised steam supply cost recovery plan which shall cover the remainder of the 12-month period. Upon receipt of a revised steam supply cost recovery plan, the commission shall reopen the steam supply and cost review. In addition, the commission may reopen the steam supply and cost review on its own motion or on the showing of good cause by any party if at least 6 months have elapsed since the utility submitted its complete filing and if there are at least 60 days remaining in the 12-month period under consideration. A reopened steam supply and cost review shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287, and in accordance with subsections (3), (6), (8), and (9).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Not more than 45 days following the last day of each billing month in which a steam supply cost recovery factor has been applied to customers' bills, a utility shall file with the commission a detailed statement for that month of the revenues recorded pursuant to the steam supply cost recovery factor and the allowance for cost of steam supply included in the base rates established in the latest commission order for the utility, and the cost of steam supply. The detailed statement shall be in the manner and form prescribed by the commission. The commission shall establish procedures for insuring that the detailed statement is promptly verified and corrected if necessary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Not less than once a year, and not later than 3 months after the end of the 12-month period covered by a utility's steam supply cost recovery plan, the commission shall commence a proceeding, to be known as a steam supply cost reconciliation, as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287. Reasonable discovery shall be permitted before and during the reconciliation proceeding in order to assist parties and interested persons in obtaining evidence concerning reconciliation issues, including, but not limited to, the reasonableness and prudence of expenditures and the amounts collected pursuant to the clause. At the steam supply cost reconciliation, the commission shall reconcile the revenues recorded pursuant to the steam supply cost recovery factors and the allowance for cost of steam supply included in the base rates established in the latest commission order for the utility with the amounts actually expensed and included in the cost of steam supply by the utility. The commission shall consider any issue regarding the reasonableness and prudence of expenses for which customers were charged if the issue was not considered adequately at a previously conducted steam supply and cost review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) In its order in a steam supply cost reconciliation, the commission shall require a utility to refund to customers or credit to customers' bills any net amount determined to have been recovered over the period covered in excess of the amounts determined to have been actually expensed by the utility for steam supply, and to have been incurred through reasonable and prudent actions not precluded by the commission order in the steam supply and cost review. The refunds or credits shall be apportioned among the customers of the utility utilizing procedures that the commission determines are reasonable. The commission may adopt different procedures with respect to customers served under the various rate schedules of the utility and may, in appropriate circumstances, order refunds or credits in proportion to the excess amounts actually collected from each customer during the period covered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) In its order in a steam supply cost reconciliation, the commission shall authorize a utility to recover from customers any net amount by which the amount determined to have been recovered over the period covered was less than the amount determined to have been actually expensed by the utility for steam supply, and to have been incurred through reasonable and prudent actions not precluded by the commission order in the steam supply and cost review. For excess costs incurred through management actions contrary to the commission's steam supply and cost review order, the commission shall authorize a utility to recover costs incurred for steam supply in the reconciliation period in excess of the amount recovered over the period only if the utility demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the excess expenses were beyond the ability of the utility to control through reasonable and prudent actions. For excess costs incurred through management actions consistent with the commission's steam supply and cost review order, the commission shall authorize a utility to recover costs incurred for steam supply in the reconciliation period in excess of the amount recovered over the period only if the utility demonstrates that the level of the expenses resulted from reasonable and prudent management actions. The amounts in excess of the amounts actually recovered by the utility for steam supply shall be apportioned among and charged to the customers of the utility utilizing procedures that the commission determines are reasonable. The commission may adopt different procedures with respect to customers served under the various rate schedules of the utility and may, in appropriate circumstances, order charges to be made in proportion to the amounts which would have been paid by those customers if the amounts in excess of the amounts actually recovered by the utility for cost of steam supply had been included in the steam supply cost recovery factors with respect to those customers during the period covered. Charges for the excess amounts shall be spread over a period that the commission determines is appropriate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) If the commission orders refunds or credits pursuant to subsection (13), or additional charges to customers pursuant to subsection (14), in its final order in a steam supply cost reconciliation, the refunds, credits, or additional charges shall include interest. In determining the interest included in a refund, credit, or additional charge pursuant to this subsection, the commission shall consider, to the extent material and practicable, the time at which the excess recoveries or insufficient recoveries, or both, occurred. The commission shall determine a rate of interest for excess recoveries, refunds, and credits equal to the greater of the average short-term borrowing rate available to the utility during the appropriate period, or the authorized rate of return on the common stock of the utility during that same period. Costs incurred by the utility for refunds and interest on refunds shall not be charged to customers. The commission shall determine a rate of interest for insufficient recoveries and additional charges equal to the average short-term borrowing rate available to the utility during the appropriate period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) The commission shall file a report with the governor and legislature 5 years after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this section, and every 5 years thereafter, that shall include recommendations for any needed legislation regarding this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An electric utility that proposes to construct an electric generation facility, make a significant investment in an existing electric generation facility, purchase an existing electric generation facility, or enter into a power purchase agreement for the purchase of electric capacity for a period of 6 years or longer may submit an application to the commission seeking a certificate of necessity for that construction, investment, or purchase if that construction, investment, or purchase costs $100,000,000.00 or more and a portion of the costs would be allocable to retail customers in this state. A significant investment in an electric generation facility includes a group of investments reasonably planned to be made over a multiple year period not to exceed 6 years for a singular purpose such as increasing the capacity of an existing electric generation plant. The commission shall not issue a certificate of necessity under this section for any environmental upgrades to existing electric generation facilities. If the application is for the construction of an electric generation facility of 225 megawatts or more or for the construction of an additional generating unit or units totaling 225 megawatts or more at an existing electric generation facility submitted as required under section 6t(13), the commission shall consolidate its proceedings under section 6t and this section. If the commission approves or denies an application for an electric generation facility under this section that has been submitted as required under section 6t(13), the provisions of this section prevail in a conflict with section 6t.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The commission may implement separate review criteria and approval standards for electric utilities with less than 1,000,000 retail customers that seek a certificate of necessity for projects costing less than $100,000,000.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An electric utility submitting an application under this section may request 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A certificate of necessity that the power to be supplied as a result of the proposed construction, investment, or purchase is needed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A certificate of necessity that the size, fuel type, and other design characteristics of the existing or proposed electric generation facility or the terms of the power purchase agreement represent the most reasonable and prudent means of meeting that power need. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A certificate of necessity that the price specified in the power purchase agreement will be recovered in rates from the electric utility's customers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A certificate of necessity that the estimated purchase or capital costs of and the financing plan for the existing or proposed electric generation facility, including, but not limited to, the costs of siting and licensing a new facility and the estimated cost of power from the new or proposed electric generation facility, will be recoverable in rates from the electric utility's customers subject to subsection (4)(c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Within 270 days after the filing of an application under this section, or, for an application for an electric generation facility submitted as required under section 6t(13), concurrently with a final order issued under section 6t, the commission shall issue an order granting or denying the requested certificate of necessity. The commission shall hold a hearing on the application. The hearing shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287. The commission may allow intervention by persons under the rules of practice and procedure of the commission and shall allow intervention by existing suppliers of electric generation capacity under subsection (13), persons allowed to intervene in the contested case under section 6t, and interested persons. The commission shall permit reasonable discovery before and during the hearing in order to assist parties and interested persons in obtaining evidence concerning the application, including, but not limited to, the reasonableness and prudence of the construction, investment, or purchase for which the certificate of necessity has been requested. The commission shall grant the request if it determines all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That the electric utility has demonstrated a need for the power that would be supplied by the existing or proposed electric generation facility or pursuant to the proposed power purchase agreement through its approved integrated resource plan under section 6t or subsection (11).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The information supplied indicates that the existing or proposed electric generation facility will comply with all applicable state and federal environmental standards, laws, and rules. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The estimated cost of power from the existing or proposed electric generation facility or the price of power specified in the proposed power purchase agreement is reasonable. The commission shall find that the cost is reasonable if, in the construction or investment in a new or existing facility, to the extent it is commercially practicable, the estimated costs are the result of competitively bid engineering, procurement, and construction contracts, or in a power purchase agreement, the cost is the result of a competitive solicitation. Up to 150 days after an electric utility makes its initial filing, it may file to update its cost estimates if they have materially changed. No other aspect of the initial filing may be modified unless the application is withdrawn and refiled. A utility's filing updating its cost estimates does not extend the period for the commission to issue an order granting or denying a certificate of necessity. An affiliate of an electric utility that serves customers in this state and at least 1 other state may participate in the competitive bidding to provide engineering, procurement, and construction services to that electric utility for a project covered by this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The existing or proposed electric generation facility or proposed power purchase agreement represents the most reasonable and prudent means of meeting the power need relative to other resource options for meeting power demand, including energy efficiency programs, electric transmission efficiencies, and any alternative proposals submitted under this section by existing suppliers of electric generation capacity under subsection (13) or other intervenors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) To the extent practicable, the construction or investment in a new or existing facility in this state is completed using a workforce composed of residents of this state as determined by the commission. This subdivision does not apply to a facility that is located in a county that lies on the border with another state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The commission may consider any other costs or information related to the costs associated with the power that would be supplied by the existing or proposed electric generation facility or pursuant to the proposed purchase agreement or alternatives to the proposal raised by intervening parties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) In a certificate of necessity under this section, the commission shall specify the costs approved for the construction of or significant investment in the electric generation facility, the price approved for the purchase of the existing electric generation facility, or the price approved for the purchase of power pursuant to the terms of the power purchase agreement. For power purchase agreements that an electric utility enters into with an entity that is not affiliated with that electric utility after the effective date of the amendatory act that added section 6t, the commission shall consider and may authorize a financial incentive for that utility that does not exceed the electric utility's weighted average cost of capital.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The utility shall annually file, or more frequent if required by the commission, reports to the commission regarding the status of any project for which a certificate of necessity has been granted under subsection (4), including an update concerning the cost and schedule of that project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the commission denies any of the relief requested by an electric utility, the electric utility may withdraw its application or proceed with the proposed construction, purchase, investment, or power purchase agreement without a certificate and the assurances granted under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Once the electric generation facility or power purchase agreement is considered used and useful or as otherwise provided in subsection (12), the commission shall include in an electric utility's retail rates all reasonable and prudent costs for an electric generation facility or power purchase agreement for which a certificate of necessity has been granted. The commission shall not disallow recovery of costs an electric utility incurs in constructing, investing in, or purchasing an electric generation facility or in purchasing power pursuant to a power purchase agreement for which a certificate of necessity has been granted, if the costs do not exceed the costs approved by the commission in the certificate. The portion of the cost of a plant, facility, or power purchase agreement that exceeds the cost approved by the commission is presumed to have been incurred due to a lack of prudence. Once the electric generation facility or power purchase agreement is considered used and useful or as otherwise provided in subsection (12), the commission shall include in the electric utility's retail rates costs actually incurred by the electric utility that exceed the costs approved by the commission only if the commission finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the additional costs were prudently incurred. The commission shall disallow costs the commission finds have been incurred as the result of fraud, concealment, gross mismanagement, or lack of quality controls amounting to gross mismanagement. The commission shall also require refunds with interest to ratepayers of any of these costs already recovered through the electric utility's rates and charges. If the assumptions underlying an approved certificate of necessity, other than a certificate of necessity approved for a power purchase agreement for the purchase of electric capacity, materially change, an electric utility may request, or the commission on its own motion may initiate, a proceeding to review whether it is reasonable and prudent to complete an unfinished project for which a certificate of necessity has been granted. If the commission finds that completion of the project is no longer reasonable and prudent, the commission may modify or cancel approval of the certificate of necessity. Except for costs the commission finds an electric utility has incurred as the result of fraud, concealment, gross mismanagement, or lack of quality controls amounting to gross mismanagement, if commission approval is modified or canceled, the commission shall not disallow reasonable and prudent costs already incurred or committed to by contract by an electric utility. Once the commission finds that completion of the project is no longer reasonable and prudent, the commission may limit future cost recovery to those costs that could not be reasonably avoided.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The commission shall adopt standard application filing forms and instructions for use in all requests for a certificate of necessity under this section. The commission may modify the standard application filing forms and instructions adopted under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The commission shall establish standards for an integrated resource plan that shall be filed by an electric utility requesting a certificate of necessity under this section. This subsection does not apply to an electric utility that has an approved integrated resource plan under section 6t. An integrated resource plan shall include all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A long-term forecast of the electric utility's load growth under various reasonable scenarios.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Before issuing the final modeling scenarios and assumptions each electric utility should include in developing its integrated resource plan, receive written comments and hold hearings to solicit public input regarding the proposed modeling scenarios and assumptions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Conduct an assessment of the potential for electrification of transportation, buildings, and industries consistent with economy-wide elimination of greenhouse gas emissions in this state, based on what is economically and technically feasible, as well as what is reasonably achievable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) Identify environmental justice communities. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A proceeding commenced under subsection (1) must be completed within 120 days, and is not a contested case under chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.288. The determination of the modeling assumptions for integrated resource plans made under subsection (1) is not considered a final order for purposes of judicial review. The determinations made under subsection (1) are only subject to judicial review as part of the final commission order approving an integrated resource plan under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Not later than April 20, 2019, each electric utility whose rates are regulated by the commission shall file with the commission an integrated resource plan that provides a 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year projection of the utility's load obligations and a plan to meet those obligations, to meet the utility's requirements to provide generation reliability, including meeting planning reserve margin and local clearing requirements determined by the commission or the appropriate independent system operator, and to meet all applicable state and federal reliability and environmental regulations over the ensuing term of the plan. The commission shall issue an order establishing filing requirements, including application forms and instructions, and filing deadlines for an integrated resource plan filed by an electric utility whose rates are regulated by the commission. The electric utility's plan may include alternative modeling scenarios and assumptions in addition to those identified under subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) For an electric utility with fewer than 1,000,000 customers in this state whose rates are regulated by the commission, the commission may issue an order implementing separate filing requirements, review criteria, and approval standards that differ from those established under subsection (3). An electric utility providing electric tariff service to customers both in this state and in at least 1 other state may design its integrated resource plan to cover all its customers on that multistate basis. If an electric utility has filed a multistate integrated resource plan that includes its service area in this state with the relevant utility regulatory commission in another state in which it provides tariff service to retail customers, the commission shall accept that integrated resource plan filing for filing purposes in this state. However, the commission may require supplemental information if necessary as part of its evaluation and determination of whether to approve the plan. Upon request of an electric utility, the commission may adjust the filing dates for a multistate integrated resource plan filing in this state to place its review on the same timeline as other relevant state reviews.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An integrated resource plan must include all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A long-term forecast of the electric utility's sales and peak demand under various reasonable scenarios.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) Projected rate and affordability impact for the periods covered by the plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) How the utility will comply with all applicable state and federal environmental regulations, laws, and rules, and the projected costs of complying with those regulations, laws, and rules.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) A forecast of the utility's peak demand and details regarding the amount of peak demand reduction the utility expects to achieve and the actions the utility proposes to take in order to achieve that peak demand reduction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) The projected long-term firm gas transportation contracts or natural gas storage the electric utility will hold to provide an adequate supply of natural gas to any new generation facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(o) The projected long-term forecast of greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants from power generated or purchased by the electric utility. The electric utility may include details on the broader emissions impact of shifting to electrification of transportation, buildings, and industries.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(p) An environmental justice impact analysis that includes a review of the reasonably anticipated environmental justice impacts for any plan that includes the construction of a new natural-gas-fired generation facility and an analysis of whether the facility complies with the requirements for clean energy systems established in the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1001 to 460.1211. If a plan proposes retiring or retaining 1 or more fossil fuel peaking plants, in an environmental justice community, a review of the reasonably anticipated environmental justice impacts for each generation facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Before filing an integrated resource plan under this section, each electric utility whose rates are regulated by the commission shall issue a request for proposals to provide any new supply-side generation capacity resources needed to serve the utility's reasonably projected electric load, applicable planning reserve margin, and local clearing requirement for its customers in this state and customers the utility serves in other states during the initial 3-year planning period to be considered in each integrated resource plan to be filed under this section. An electric utility shall define qualifying performance standards, contract terms, technical competence, capability, reliability, creditworthiness, past performance, and other criteria that responses and respondents to the request for proposals must meet in order to be considered by the utility in its integrated resource plan to be filed under this section. Respondents to a request for proposals may request that certain proprietary information be exempt from public disclosure as allowed by the commission. A utility that issues a request for proposals under this subsection shall use the resulting proposals to inform its integrated resource plan filed under this section and include all of the submitted proposals as attachments to its integrated resource plan filing regardless of whether the proposals met the qualifying performance standards, contract terms, technical competence, capability, reliability, creditworthiness, past performance, or other criteria specified for the utility's request for proposals under this section. An existing supplier of electric generation capacity currently producing at least 200 megawatts of firm electric generation capacity resources located in the independent system operator's zone in which the utility's load is served that seeks to provide electric generation capacity resources to the utility may submit a written proposal directly to the commission as an alternative to any supply-side generation capacity resource included in the electric utility's integrated resource plan submitted under this section, and has standing to intervene in the contested case proceeding conducted under this section. This subsection does not require an entity that submits an alternative under this subsection to submit an integrated resource plan. This subsection does not limit the ability of any other person to submit to the commission an alternative proposal to any supply-side generation capacity resource included in the electric utility's integrated resource plan submitted under this section and to petition for and be granted leave to intervene in the contested case proceeding conducted under this section under the rules of practice and procedure of the commission. The commission shall only consider an alternative proposal submitted under this subsection as part of its approval process under subsection (8). The electric utility submitting an integrated resource plan under this section is not required to adopt any proposals submitted under this subsection. To the extent practicable, each electric utility is encouraged, but not required, to partner with other electric providers in the same local resource zone as the utility's load is served in the development of any new supply-side generation capacity resources included as part of its integrated resource plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Not later than 300 days after an electric utility files an integrated resource plan under this section, the commission shall state if the commission has any recommended changes, and if so, describe them in sufficient detail to allow their incorporation in the integrated resource plan. If the commission does not recommend changes, it shall issue a final, appealable order approving or denying the plan filed by the electric utility. If the commission recommends changes, the commission shall set a schedule allowing parties at least 15 days after that recommendation to file comments regarding those recommendations, and allowing the electric utility at least 30 days to consider the recommended changes and submit a revised integrated resource plan that incorporates 1 or more of the recommended changes. If the electric utility submits a revised integrated resource plan under this section, the commission shall issue a final, appealable order approving the plan as revised by the electric utility or denying the plan. The commission shall issue a final, appealable order no later than 360 days after an electric utility files an integrated resource plan under this section. Up to 150 days after an electric utility makes its initial filing, the electric utility may file to update its cost estimates if those cost estimates have materially changed. A utility shall not modify any other aspect of the initial filing unless the utility withdraws and refiles the application. A utility's filing updating its cost estimates does not extend the period for the commission to issue an order approving or denying the integrated resource plan. The following are applicable to an integrated resource plan filed under this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The commission shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Review the integrated resource plan in a contested case proceeding conducted in accordance with chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.288.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Allow intervention by interested persons including electric customers of the utility, respondents to the utility's request for proposals under this section, or other parties approved by the commission. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Request an advisory opinion from the department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy regarding all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) Whether any potential decrease in emissions of sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, mercury, and particulate matter would reasonably be expected to result if the integrated resource plan proposed by the electric utility under subsection (3) was approved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) Whether the integrated resource plan can reasonably be expected to achieve compliance with the regulations, laws, or rules identified in subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(C) The potential impacts of proposed energy generation resources and of any prudent and feasible alternatives identified by the department on whether the plan makes adequate progress toward achieving the clean energy standard established in section 51 of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1051.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(D) The potential impacts of the plan and of any prudent and feasible alternatives identified by the department on whether the plan makes adequate progress toward the economy-wide virtual elimination of greenhouse gas emissions in this state by 2050.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(E) Whether the plan in comparison to any prudent and feasible alternatives makes adequate progress toward the elimination of adverse effects on human health due to power generation in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(F) Whether the plan in comparison to any prudent and feasible alternatives adequately reduces harms to the health, safety, and welfare of individuals in environmental justice communities. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The commission may do 1 or both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Take official notice of the opinion issued by the department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy under this subsection pursuant to R 792.10428 of the Michigan Administrative Code. Information submitted by the department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy under this subsection is advisory and is not binding on future determinations by the department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy or the commission in any proceeding or permitting process. This section does not prevent an electric utility from applying for, or receiving, any necessary permits from the department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Invite other state agencies to provide testimony regarding other relevant regulatory requirements related to the integrated resource plan. The commission shall permit reasonable discovery after an integrated resource plan is filed and during the hearing in order to assist parties and interested persons in obtaining evidence concerning the integrated resource plan, including, but not limited to, the reasonableness and prudence of the plan and alternatives to the plan raised by intervening parties. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The commission shall approve the integrated resource plan under subsection (7) if the commission determines all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The proposed integrated resource plan represents the most reasonable and prudent means of meeting the electric utility's energy and capacity needs. To determine whether the integrated resource plan is the most reasonable and prudent means of meeting energy and capacity needs, the commission shall consider whether the plan appropriately balances all of the following factors:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Resource adequacy and capacity to serve anticipated peak electric load, applicable planning reserve margin, and local clearing requirement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Compliance with applicable state and federal environmental regulations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Competitive pricing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Reliability.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) To the extent practicable, the construction or investment in a new or existing capacity resource in this state is completed using a workforce composed of residents of this state as determined by the commission. This subdivision does not apply to a capacity resource that is located in a county that lies on the border with another state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The construction and construction maintenance of new or the rehabilitation of existing capacity resources in this state includes using an apprenticeship program registered and certified with the United States Secretary of Labor under the national apprenticeship act, 29 USC 50 to 50c, and the workers employed for the construction or construction maintenance of the energy facility are paid a minimum wage standard not less than the wage and fringe benefit rates prevailing in the locality in which the work is to be performed as determined under 2023 PA 10, MCL 408.1101 to 408.1126, or 40 USC 3141 to 3148, whichever provides the higher wage and fringe benefit rates, and, to the extent permitted by law, the entities performing the construction or construction maintenance work shall enter into a project labor agreement or operate under a collective bargaining agreement for the work to be performed. This subdivision does not apply to an independent power producer supplying power under a contract or agreement entered into in accordance with the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978, Public Law 95-617, as of the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subdivision. As used in this subdivision, "project labor agreement" means a prehire collective bargaining agreement with 1 or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and does all of the following: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Binds all contractors and subcontractors on the construction project through the inclusion of appropriate specifications in all relevant solicitation provisions and contract documents.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Allows all contractors and subcontractors on the construction project to compete for contracts and subcontracts without regard to whether they are otherwise parties to collective bargaining agreements.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) Complies with all state and federal laws, rules, and regulations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The plan is consistent with the renewable energy plan requirements and goals of section 28 of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1028, the clean energy requirements of section 51 of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1051, the energy waste reduction measures in section 77 of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1077, and the energy storage target of section 101 of the clean and renewable energy and energy waste reduction act, 2008 PA 295, MCL 460.1101.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The plan promotes environmental quality and public health and reasonably mitigates adverse effects on human health due to power generation, with a priority on mitigating impacts and prioritizing benefits to communities disproportionately impacted by pollution and other environmental harms.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The plan meets the requirements of subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the commission denies a utility's integrated resource plan, the utility, within 60 days after the date of the final order denying the integrated resource plan, may submit revisions to the integrated resource plan to the commission for approval. The commission shall commence a new contested case hearing under chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.288. Not later than 90 days after the date that the utility submits the revised integrated resource plan to the commission under this subsection, the commission shall issue an order approving or denying, with recommendations, the revised integrated resource plan if the revisions are not substantial or inconsistent with the original integrated resource plan filed under this section. If the revisions are substantial or inconsistent with the original integrated resource plan, the commission has up to 150 days to issue an order approving or denying, with recommendations, the revised integrated resource plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If the commission denies an electric utility's integrated resource plan, the electric utility may proceed with a proposed construction, purchase, investment, or power purchase agreement contained in the integrated resource plan without the assurances granted under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) In approving an integrated resource plan under this section, the commission shall specify the costs approved for the construction of or significant investment in an electric generation or energy storage facility, the purchase of an existing electric generation or energy storage facility, the purchase of power under the terms of the power purchase or energy storage agreement, or other investments or resources used to meet energy and capacity needs that are included in the approved integrated resource plan. The costs for specifically identified investments, including the costs for facilities under subsection (12), included in an approved integrated resource plan that are commenced within 3 years after the commission's order approving the initial plan, amended plan, or plan review are considered reasonable and prudent for cost recovery purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (13), for a new electric generation or energy storage facility approved in an integrated resource plan that is to be owned by the electric utility and that is commenced within 3 years after the commission's order approving the plan, the commission shall finalize the approved costs for the electric generation or energy storage facility only after the utility has done all of the following and filed the results, analysis, and recommendations with the commission:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Implemented a competitive bidding process for all major engineering, procurement, and construction contracts associated with the construction of the electric generation or energy storage facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Implemented a competitive bidding process that allows third parties to submit firm and binding bids for the construction of an electric generation or energy storage facility on behalf of the utility that would meet all of the technical, commercial, and other specifications required by the utility for the generation or energy storage facility, such that ownership of the electric generation or energy storage facility vests with the utility no later than the date the electric generation or energy storage facility becomes commercially available. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Demonstrated to the commission that the finalized costs for the new electric generation or energy storage facility are not significantly higher than the initially approved costs under subsection (11). If the finalized costs are found to be significantly higher than the initially approved costs, the commission shall review and approve the proposed costs if the commission determines those costs are reasonable and prudent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) If the capacity resource under subsection (12) is for the construction of an electric generation facility of 225 megawatts or more or for the construction of an additional generating unit or units totaling 225 megawatts or more at an existing electric generation facility, the utility shall submit an application to the commission seeking a certificate of necessity under section 6s.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) An electric utility shall annually, or more frequently if required by the commission, file reports to the commission regarding the status of any projects included in the initial 3-year period of an integrated resource plan approved under subsection (7).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) If an electric provider whose rates are regulated by the commission enters into a purchase power agreement for renewable energy resources or a third-party contract for energy storage systems or clean energy systems with an entity that is not affiliated with that utility, the commission shall authorize a financial incentive for that utility calculated as the product of contract payments in that year multiplied by the electric provider's pretax weighted average cost of permanent capital comprised of long-term debt obligations and equity of the electric provider's total capital structure as determined by the commission's final order in the electric provider's most recent general rate case. The pretax weighted average cost of permanent capital used to calculate the financial incentive must not be fixed throughout the entire term of the contract at the pretax weighted average cost of capital applicable in the first year and must be updated based on the commission's final order in each succeeding general rate case for the electric provider. The financial incentive applies to each contract described in this subsection from the date the contract is executed for the entire term of the contract. This subsection applies to any contract entered into after June 30, 2024.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an order by the commission approving an integrated resource plan may be reviewed by the court of appeals upon a filing by a party to the commission proceeding within 30 days after the order is issued. All appeals of the order must be heard and determined as expeditiously as possible with lawful precedence over other matters. Review on appeal is based solely on the record before the commission and briefs to the court and is limited to whether the order conforms to the constitution and laws of this state and the United States and is within the authority of the commission under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) The commission shall include in an electric utility's retail rates all reasonable and prudent costs specified under subsections (11) and (12) that have been incurred to implement an integrated resource plan approved by the commission. The commission shall not disallow recovery of costs an electric utility incurs in implementing an approved integrated resource plan, if the costs do not exceed the costs approved by the commission under subsections (11) and (12). If the actual costs incurred by the electric utility exceed the costs approved by the commission, the electric utility has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the costs are reasonable and prudent. The portion of the cost of a plant, facility, power purchase agreement, or other investment in a resource that meets a demonstrated need for capacity that exceeds the cost approved by the commission is presumed to have been incurred due to a lack of prudence. The commission may include any or all of the portion of the cost in excess of the cost approved by the commission if the commission finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the costs are reasonable and prudent. The commission shall disallow costs the commission finds have been incurred as the result of fraud, concealment, gross mismanagement, or lack of quality controls amounting to gross mismanagement. The commission shall also require refunds with interest to ratepayers of any of these costs already recovered through the electric utility's rates and charges. If the assumptions underlying an approved integrated resource plan materially change, or if the commission believes it is unlikely that a project or program will become commercially operational, an electric utility may request, or the commission on its own motion may initiate, a proceeding to review whether it is reasonable and prudent to complete an unfinished project or program included in an approved integrated resource plan. If the commission finds that completion of the project or program is no longer reasonable and prudent, the commission may modify or cancel approval of the project or program and unincurred costs in the electric utility's integrated resource plan. Except for costs the commission finds an electric utility has incurred as the result of fraud, concealment, gross mismanagement, or lack of quality controls amounting to gross mismanagement, if commission approval is modified or canceled, the commission shall not disallow reasonable and prudent costs already incurred or committed to by contract by an electric utility. Once the commission finds that completion of the project or program is no longer reasonable and prudent, the commission may limit future cost recovery to those costs that could not be reasonably avoided.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) The commission may allow financing interest cost recovery in an electric utility's base rates on construction work in progress for capital improvements approved under this section prior to the assets' being considered used and useful. Regardless of whether or not the commission authorizes base rate treatment for construction work in progress financing interest expense, an electric utility may recognize, accrue, and defer the allowance for funds used during construction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) An electric utility may seek to amend an approved integrated resource plan. Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, the commission shall consider the amendments under the same process and standards that govern the review and approval of a revised integrated resource plan under subsection (9). The commission may order an electric utility that seeks to amend an approved integrated resource plan under this subsection to file a plan review under subsection (21).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) An electric utility shall file an application for review of its integrated resource plan not later than 5 years after the effective date of the most recent commission order approving a plan, a plan amendment, or a plan review. The commission shall consider a plan review under the same process and standards established in this section for review and approval of an integrated resource plan. A commission order approving a plan review has the same effect as an order approving an integrated resource plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) The commission may, on its own motion or at the request of the electric utility, order an electric utility to file a plan review. The department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy may request the commission to order a plan review to address material changes in environmental regulations and requirements that occur after the commission's approval of an integrated resource plan. An electric utility must file a plan review within 270 days after the commission orders the utility to file a plan review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) As used in this section, "long-term firm gas transportation" means a binding agreement entered into between the electric utility and a natural gas transmission provider for a set period of time to provide firm delivery of natural gas to an electric generation facility.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In the study required under this section, the commission shall review performance-based regulation systems that have been implemented in another state or country, including, but not limited to, the RIIO (revenue = incentives + innovation + outputs) model utilized in the United Kingdom.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In reviewing various performance-based regulation systems, the commission shall evaluate, but not be limited to, all of the following factors:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Methods for estimating the revenue needed by a utility during a multiyear pricing period, and a fair return, that uses forecasts of efficient total expenditures by the utility instead of distinguishing between operating and capital costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Methods to increase the length of time between rate cases, to provide utilities with more opportunity to retain cost savings without the threat of imminent rate adjustments, and to encourage utilities to make investments that have extended payback periods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Options for establishing incentives and penalties that pertain to issues such as customer satisfaction, safety, reliability, environmental impact, and social obligations.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Notwithstanding any existing power purchase agreement, the commission shall, at least every 5 years, conduct a proceeding, as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287, to reevaluate the procedures and rates schedules including avoided cost rates, as originally established by the commission in an order dated March 17, 1981 in case no. U-6798, to implement title II, section 210, of the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978, as it relates to qualifying facilities from which utilities in this state have an obligation to purchase energy and capacity. Nothing in this section supersedes the provisions of PURPA or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's regulations and orders implementing PURPA.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In setting rates for avoided costs, the commission shall take into consideration the factors regarding avoided costs set forth in PURPA and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's regulations and orders implementing PURPA.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) After an initial contested case under subsection (1), for a utility serving less than 1,000,000 electric customers in this state, the commission may conduct any periodic reevaluations of the procedures, rate schedules, and avoided cost rates for that utility using notice and comment procedures instead of a full contested case. The commission shall conduct the periodic reevaluation in a contested case under chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287, if a qualifying facility files a comment disputing the utility filing and requesting a contested case.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An order issued by the commission under subsection (1) shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Ensure that the rates for purchases by an electric utility from, and rates for sales to, a qualifying facility shall, over the term of a contract, be just and reasonable and in the public interest, as defined by PURPA.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Ensure that an electric utility does not discriminate against a qualifying facility with respect to the conditions or price for provision of maintenance power, backup power, interruptible power, and supplementary power or for any other service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Require that any prices charged by an electric utility for maintenance power, backup power, interruptible power, and supplementary power and all other such services are cost-based and just and reasonable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Establish a schedule of avoided cost price updates for each electric utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Require electric utilities to publish on their websites template contracts for power purchase agreements for qualifying facilities of less than 3 megawatts that need not include terms for either price or duration of the contract. The terms of a template contract published under this subsection are not binding on either an electric utility or a qualifying facility and may be negotiated and altered upon agreement between an electric utility and a qualifying facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Within 1 year after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this section, and every 2 years thereafter, the commission shall issue a report to the Michigan agency for energy and the standing committees of the senate and house of representatives with primary responsibility for energy and environmental issues. The report shall provide a description and status of qualifying facilities in this state, the current status of power purchase agreements of each qualifying facility, and the commission's efforts to comply with the requirements of PURPA.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Avoided costs" means that term as defined in 18 CFR 292.101.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Backup power" means electric energy or capacity supplied by an electric utility to replace electric energy ordinarily generated by a qualifying facility's own electric generation equipment during an unscheduled outage of the qualifying facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Maintenance power" means electric energy or capacity supplied by an electric utility during scheduled outages of the qualifying facility.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the appropriate independent system operator receives approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to implement a resource adequacy tariff that provides for a capacity forward auction, and includes the option for a state to implement a prevailing state compensation mechanism for capacity, then the commission shall examine whether the prevailing state compensation mechanism would be more cost-effective, reasonable, and prudent than the capacity forward auction for this state before the commission may order the prevailing state compensation mechanism to be implemented in any utility service territory in which the prevailing state compensation mechanism is not yet effective. Before the commission orders the implementation of the prevailing state compensation mechanism in 1 or more utility service territories, the commission shall hold a contested case hearing pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287. The commission shall allow intervention by interested persons, alternative electric suppliers, and customers of alternative electric suppliers and the utility under consideration. At the conclusion of the proceeding, the commission shall make a finding for each utility service territory under consideration, based on clear and convincing evidence, as to whether or not the prevailing state compensation mechanism would be more cost-effective, reasonable, and prudent than the use of the capacity forward auction for this state in meeting the local clearing requirement and the planning reserve margin requirement. The contested case must be scheduled for completion by December 1 before the independent system operator's capacity forward auction for this state, and the commission's decision shall identify which utility service territories will be subject to the prevailing state compensation mechanism. If the commission implements the prevailing state compensation mechanism, it shall implement the prevailing state compensation mechanism for a minimum of 4 consecutive planning years unless such period conflicts with the federal tariff. The commission shall establish the charge as a capacity charge under subsection (3) and determine that charge consistent with the approved resource adequacy tariff of the appropriate independent system operator. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the appropriate independent system operator receives approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to implement a resource adequacy tariff that provides for a capacity forward auction, and does not include the option for a state to implement a prevailing state compensation mechanism for capacity, then the commission shall examine whether a state reliability mechanism established under subsection (8) would be more cost-effective, reasonable, and prudent than the capacity forward auction for this state before the commission may order the state reliability mechanism to be implemented in any utility service territory. Before the commission orders the implementation of the state reliability mechanism in 1 or more utility service territories, the commission shall hold a contested case hearing pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287. The commission shall allow intervention by interested persons, alternative electric suppliers, and customers of alternative electric suppliers and the utility under consideration. At the conclusion of the proceeding, the commission shall make a finding for each utility service territory under consideration, based on clear and convincing evidence, as to whether or not the state reliability mechanism would be more cost-effective, reasonable, and prudent than the use of the capacity forward auction for this state in meeting the local clearing requirement and the planning reserve margin requirement. The contested case must be scheduled for completion by December 1 before the independent system operator's capacity forward auction for this state, and the commission's decision shall identify which utility service territories will be subject to the state reliability mechanism. If, by September 30, 2017, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does not put into effect a resource adequacy tariff that includes a capacity forward auction or a prevailing state compensation mechanism, then the commission shall establish a state reliability mechanism under subsection (8). The commission may commence a proceeding before October 1 if the commission believes orderly administration would be enabled by doing so. If the commission implements a state reliability mechanism, it shall be for a minimum of 4 consecutive planning years beginning in the upcoming planning year. A state reliability charge must be established in the same manner as a capacity charge under subsection (3) and be determined consistent with subsection (8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) After the effective date of the amendatory act that added section 6t, the commission shall establish a capacity charge as provided in this section. A determination of a capacity charge must be conducted as a contested case pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287, after providing interested persons with notice and a reasonable opportunity for a full and complete hearing and conclude by December 1 of each year. The commission shall allow intervention by interested persons, alternative electric suppliers, and customers of alternative electric suppliers and the utility under consideration. The commission shall provide notice to the public of the single capacity charge as determined for each territory. No new capacity charge is required to be paid before June 1, 2018. The capacity charge must be applied to alternative electric load that is not exempt as set forth under subsections (6) and (7). If the commission elects to implement a capacity forward auction for this state as set forth in subsection (1) or (2), then a capacity charge shall not apply beginning in the first year that the capacity forward auction for this state is effective. In order to ensure that noncapacity electric generation services are not included in the capacity charge, in determining the capacity charge, the commission shall do both of the following and ensure that the resulting capacity charge does not differ for full service load and alternative electric supplier load: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For the applicable term of the capacity charge, include the capacity-related generation costs included in the utility's base rates, surcharges, and power supply cost recovery factors, regardless of whether those costs result from utility ownership of the capacity resources or the purchase or lease of the capacity resource from a third party. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For the applicable term of the capacity charge, subtract all non-capacity-related electric generation costs, including, but not limited to, costs previously set for recovery through net stranded cost recovery and securitization and the projected revenues, net of projected fuel costs, from all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) All energy market sales.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Off-system energy sales.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Ancillary services sales.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Energy sales under unit-specific bilateral contracts. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The commission shall provide for a true-up mechanism that results in a utility charge or credit for the difference between the projected net revenues described in subsection (3) and the actual net revenues reflected in the capacity charge. The true-up shall be reflected in the capacity charge in the subsequent year. The methodology used to set the capacity charge shall be the same methodology used in the true-up for the applicable planning year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Not less than once every year, the commission shall review or amend the capacity charge in all subsequent rate cases, power supply cost recovery cases, or separate proceedings established for that purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A capacity charge shall not be assessed for any portion of capacity obligations for each planning year for which an alternative electric supplier can demonstrate that it can meet its capacity obligations through owned or contractual rights to any resource that the appropriate independent system operator allows to meet the capacity obligation of the electric provider. The preceding sentence shall not be applied in any way that conflicts with a federal resource adequacy tariff, when applicable. Any electric provider that has previously demonstrated that it can meet all or a portion of its capacity obligations shall give notice to the commission by September 1 of the year 4 years before the beginning of the applicable planning year if it does not expect to meet that capacity obligation and instead expects to pay a capacity charge. The capacity charge in the utility service territory must be paid for the portion of its load taking service from the alternative electric supplier not covered by capacity as set forth in this subsection during the period that any such capacity charge is effective. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An electric provider shall provide capacity to meet the capacity obligation for the portion of that load taking service from an alternative electric supplier in the electric provider's service territory that is covered by the capacity charge during the period that any such capacity charge is effective. The alternative electric supplier has the obligation to provide capacity for the portion of the load for which the alternative electric supplier has demonstrated an ability to meet its capacity obligations. If an alternative electric supplier ceases to provide service for a portion or all of its load, it shall allow, at a cost no higher than the determined capacity charge, the assignment of any right to that capacity in the applicable planning year to whatever electric provider accepts that load. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a state reliability mechanism is required to be established under subsection (2), the commission shall do all of the following: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Require, by December 1 of each year, that each electric utility demonstrate to the commission, in a format determined by the commission, that for the planning year beginning 4 years after the beginning of the current planning year, the electric utility owns or has contractual rights to sufficient capacity to meet its capacity obligations as set by the appropriate independent system operator, or commission, as applicable. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Require, by the seventh business day of February each year, that each alternative electric supplier, cooperative electric utility, or municipally owned electric utility demonstrate to the commission, in a format determined by the commission, that for the planning year beginning 4 years after the beginning of the current planning year, the alternative electric supplier, cooperative electric utility, or municipally owned electric utility owns or has contractual rights to sufficient capacity to meet its capacity obligations as set by the appropriate independent system operator, or commission, as applicable. One or more municipally owned electric utilities may aggregate their capacity resources that are located in the same local resource zone to meet the requirements of this subdivision. One or more cooperative electric utilities may aggregate their capacity resources that are located in the same local resource zone to meet the requirements of this subdivision. A cooperative or municipally owned electric utility may meet the requirements of this subdivision through any resource, including a resource acquired through a capacity forward auction, that the appropriate independent system operator allows to qualify for meeting the local clearing requirement. A cooperative or municipally owned electric utility's payment of an auction price related to a capacity deficiency as part of a capacity forward auction conducted by the appropriate independent system operator does not by itself satisfy the resource adequacy requirements of this section unless the appropriate independent system operator can directly tie that provider's payment to a capacity resource that meets the requirements of this subsection. By the seventh business day of February in 2018, an alternative electric supplier shall demonstrate to the commission, in a format determined by the commission, that for the planning year beginning June 1, 2018, and the subsequent 3 planning years, the alternative electric supplier owns or has contractual rights to sufficient capacity to meet its capacity obligations as set by the appropriate independent system operator, or commission, as applicable. If the commission finds an electric provider has failed to demonstrate it can meet a portion or all of its capacity obligation, the commission shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) For alternative electric load, require the payment of a capacity charge that is determined, assessed, and applied in the same manner as under subsection (3) for that portion of the load not covered as set forth in subsections (6) and (7). If a capacity charge is required to be paid under this subdivision in the planning year beginning June 1, 2018 or any of the 3 subsequent planning years, the capacity charge is applicable for each of those planning years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) For a cooperative or municipally owned electric utility, recommend to the attorney general that suit be brought consistent with the provisions of subsection (9) to require that procurement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) For an electric utility, require any audits and reporting as the commission considers necessary to determine if sufficient capacity is procured. If an electric utility fails to meet its capacity obligations, the commission may assess appropriate and reasonable fines, penalties, and customer refunds under this act. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) In order to determine the capacity obligations, request that the appropriate independent system operator provide technical assistance in determining the local clearing requirement and planning reserve margin requirement. If the appropriate independent system operator declines, or has not made a determination by October 1 of that year, the commission shall set any required local clearing requirement and planning reserve margin requirement, consistent with federal reliability requirements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) In order to determine if resources put forward will meet such federal reliability requirements, request technical assistance from the appropriate independent system operator to assist with assessing resources to ensure that any resources will meet federal reliability requirements. If the technical assistance is rendered, the commission shall accept the appropriate independent system operator's determinations unless it finds adequate justification to deviate from the determinations related to the qualification of resources. If the appropriate independent system operator declines, or has not made a determination by February 28, the commission shall make those determinations. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The attorney general or any customer of a municipally owned electric utility or cooperative electric utility may commence a civil action for injunctive relief against that municipally owned electric utility or cooperative electric utility if the municipally owned electric utility or cooperative electric utility fails to meet the applicable requirements of subsection (8)(b). The attorney general or customer shall commence an action under this subsection in the circuit court for the county in which the principal office of the municipally owned electric utility or cooperative electric utility is located. The attorney general or customer shall not file an action under this subsection unless the attorney general or customer gives the municipally owned electric utility or cooperative electric utility at least 60 days' written notice of the intent to sue, the basis for the suit, and the relief sought. Within 30 days after the municipally owned electric utility or cooperative electric utility receives written notice of the intent to sue, the municipally owned electric utility or cooperative electric utility and the attorney general or customer shall meet and make a good-faith attempt to determine if there is a credible basis for the action. The municipally owned electric utility or cooperative electric utility shall take all reasonable and prudent steps necessary to comply with the applicable requirements of subsection (8)(b) within 90 days after the meeting if there is a credible basis for the action. If the parties do not agree as to whether there is a credible basis for the action, the attorney general or customer may proceed to file the suit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The commission shall adjust the dates under this section if needed to ensure proper alignment with the appropriate independent system operator's procedures and requirements. However, any changes to the dates in this section must ensure that providers still meet applicable reliability requirements. The commission shall not permit a capacity charge to be assessed under this section for any year in which it has elected the capacity forward auction instead of the prevailing state compensation mechanism or the state reliability mechanism.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Nothing in this act shall prevent the commission from determining a generation capacity charge under the reliability assurance agreement, rate schedule FERC No. 44 of the independent system operator known as PJM Interconnection, LLC, as approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in docket no. ER10-2710 or similar successor tariff.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A covered utility shall not discontinue utility service to a geographic area that the covered utility serves without first filing an abandonment application with the commission and obtaining approval from the commission to discontinue that service after notice and a contested case proceeding. The commission shall not approve any abandonment application filed under this section unless the commission determines that there is clear and convincing evidence that all affected customers would have access to affordable, reliable, and safe utility service from an alternative source. A covered utility does not have to file an abandonment application under this section if utility service is being discontinued to a specific parcel or parcels to enable another covered utility to provide service that the other covered utility is legally permitted to provide.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The commission may issue orders to ensure that an alternative gas supplier or natural gas utility does not switch a customer to another supplier without the customer's written confirmation, confirmation through an independent third party, or other verification procedures subject to commission approval, confirming the customer's intent to make a switch and that the customer has approved the specific details of the switch.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   An alternative gas supplier or natural gas utility shall not include or add optional services in a customer's service package without the authorization of the customer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The commission may issue orders to ensure that an alternative gas supplier or natural gas utility does not include or add optional services in a customer's service package without the customer's written confirmation, confirmation through an independent third party, or other verification procedures approved by the commission confirming the customer's intent to receive the optional services.</DIV>

Any standards established under this subsection shall be developed to do all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Not be unduly burdensome.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Not unnecessarily delay or inhibit the initiation and development of competition among alternative gas suppliers or natural gas utilities in any market.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   If after notice and hearing the commission finds a person has violated this section, the commission may order remedies and penalties to protect and make whole another person who has suffered an economic loss as a result of the violation, including, but not limited to, 1 or more of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Order the person to pay a fine for the first offense of not less than $20,000.00 or more than $30,000.00. For a second and any subsequent offense, the commission shall order the person to pay a fine of not less than $30,000.00 or more than $50,000.00.

Each switch made in violation of subsection (2) or service added in violation of subsection (4) shall be a separate offense under this subdivision.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Order an unauthorized supplier to refund to the customer any amount greater than the customer would have paid to an authorized supplier.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Order a portion between 10% to 50% of the fine assessed under subdivision (a) be paid directly to the customer who suffered the violation of subsection (2) or (4).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Order the person to reimburse an authorized supplier an amount equal to the amount paid by the customer that should have been paid to the authorized supplier.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   If the person is licensed under this act, revoke the license if the commission finds a pattern of violations of subsection (2) or (4).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Issue cease and desist orders.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   Notwithstanding subsection (9), a fine shall not be imposed for a violation if the person shows that the violation was an unintentional and bona fide error which occurred notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adopted to avoid the error.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   A natural gas utility shall not be found in violation of this section for switching a customer's supplier or adding optional services to a customer's account if the switch or addition was made pursuant to the request or notice of an alternative gas supplier that is responsible under a customer choice program for obtaining the customer's approval.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The commission shall issue orders establishing the rates, terms, and conditions of service that allow retail customers to take service from an alternative electric supplier. The orders shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, provide that no more than 10% of an electric utility's average weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year may take service from an alternative electric supplier at any time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Set forth procedures necessary to allocate the amount of load that will be allowed to be served by alternative electric suppliers, through the use of annual energy allotments awarded on a calendar year basis. If the sales of a utility are less in a subsequent year or if the energy usage of a customer receiving electric service from an alternative electric supplier exceeds its annual energy allotment for that facility, that customer shall not be forced to purchase electricity from a utility, but may purchase electricity from an alternative electric supplier for that facility during that calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, provide that, if the commission determines that less than 10% of an electric utility's average weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year is taking service from alternative electric suppliers, the commission shall set as a cap on the weather-adjusted retail sales that may take service from an alternative electric supplier, for the current calendar year and 5 subsequent calendar years, the percentage amount of weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year rounded up to the nearest whole percentage. If the cap is not adjusted for 6 consecutive calendar years, the cap shall return to 10% in the calendar year following that sixth consecutive calendar year.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Provide that for an existing facility that is receiving 100% of its electric service from an alternative electric supplier on or after the effective date of the amendatory act that added section 6t, the owner of that facility may purchase electricity from an alternative electric supplier, regardless of whether the sales exceed 10% of the servicing electric utility's average weather-adjusted retail sales, for both the existing electric choice load at that facility and any expanded load arising after the effective date of the amendatory act that added section 6t at that facility as well as any new facility that is similar in nature to the existing facility, that is constructed or acquired by the customer on a site contiguous to the existing site or on a site that would be contiguous to an existing site in the absence of an existing public right-of-way, and the customer owns more than 50% of that facility. This subdivision does not authorize or permit an existing facility being served by an electric utility on standard tariff service on the effective date of the amendatory act that added section 6t to be served by an alternative electric supplier.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Provide that a customer on an enrollment queue waiting to take retail open access service as of December 31, 2015 shall continue on the queue and an electric utility shall add a new customer to the queue if the customer's prospective alternative electric supplier submits an enrollment request to the electric utility. A customer shall be removed from the queue by notifying the electric utility electronically or in writing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Require each electric utility to file with the commission not later than January 15 of each year a rank-ordered queue of all customers awaiting retail open access service under subdivision (g).

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) This act does not prohibit or limit the right of a person to engage in affiliate wheeling and does not impose a transition, implementation, exit fee, or any other similar charge on a person engaged in affiliate wheeling. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The rights of parties to existing contracts and agreements in effect as of January 1, 2000 between electric utilities and qualifying facilities, including the right to have the charges recovered from the customers of an electric utility, or its successor, are not abrogated, increased, or diminished by this act, nor shall the receipt of any proceeds of the securitization bonds by an electric utility be a basis for any regulatory disallowance. Further, any securitization or financing order issued by the commission that relates to a qualifying facility's power purchase contract shall fully consider that qualifying facility's legal and financial interests.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A customer that elects to receive service from an alternative electric supplier may subsequently provide notice to the electric utility of the customer's desire to receive standard tariff service from the electric utility under procedures approved by the commission. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The commission shall authorize rates that will ensure that an electric utility that offered retail open access service from 2002 through October 6, 2008 fully recovers its restructuring costs and any associated accrued regulatory assets.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Upon the application of an electric utility, if the commission finds that the net present value of the revenues to be collected under the financing order is less than the amount that would be recovered over the remaining life of the qualified costs using conventional financing methods and that the financing order is consistent with the standards in subsection (2), the commission shall issue a financing order to allow the utility to recover qualified costs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In a financing order, the commission shall ensure all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That the proceeds of the securitization bonds are used solely for the purposes of the refinancing or retirement of debt or equity.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   That securitization provides tangible and quantifiable benefits to customers of the electric utility.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   That the expected structuring and expected pricing of the securitization bonds will result in the lowest securitization charges consistent with market conditions and the terms of the financing order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   That the amount securitized does not exceed the net present value of the revenue requirement over the life of the proposed securitization bonds associated with the qualified costs sought to be securitized.</DIV>

Review on appeal shall be based solely on the record before the commission and briefs to the court and shall be limited to whether the financing order conforms to the constitution and laws of this state and the United States and is within the authority of the commission under this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   At the request of an electric utility, the commission may adopt a financing order providing for retiring and refunding securitization bonds if the commission finds that the future securitization charges required to service the new securitization bonds, including transaction costs, will be less than the future securitization charges required to service the securitization bonds being refunded. On the retirement of the refunded securitization bonds, the commission shall adjust the related securitization charges accordingly.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   The commission shall have the authority to retain financial or legal services to assist in issuance of a financing order and to require the electric utility to pay the cost of the services. The payments shall be included as qualified costs defined in section 10h(g).</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The lien and security interest shall attach automatically from the time that value is received for the bonds and shall be a continuously perfected lien and security interest in the securitization property and all proceeds of the property, whether accrued or not, shall have priority in the order of filing when a financing statement has been filed with respect to the security interest in accordance with the uniform commercial code, 1962 PA 174, MCL 440.1101 to 440.11102, and take precedence over any subsequent judicial and other lien creditor. In addition to the rights and remedies provided by this act, all rights and remedies with respect to a security interest provided by the uniform commercial code, 1962 PA 174, MCL 440.1101 to 440.11102, shall apply to the securitization property.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The priority of a lien and security interest under this section is not impaired by any later modification of the financing order or by the commingling of funds arising from securitization charges with other funds, and any other security interest that may apply to those funds shall be terminated when they are transferred to a segregated account for the assignee or a financing party. If securitization property has been transferred to an assignee, any proceeds of that property shall be held in trust for the assignee.</DIV>

An order shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the debtor, pledgor, or transferor of the property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Securitization property shall constitute an account as that term is defined under the uniform commercial code, 1962 PA 174, MCL 440.1101 to 440.11102.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   For purposes of this act and the uniform commercial code, 1962 PA 174, MCL 440.1101 to 440.11102, securitization property shall be in existence whether or not the revenue or proceeds in respect to the property have accrued and whether or not the value of the property right is dependent on the customers of an electric utility receiving service.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Each electric utility operating in this state shall establish an industry worker transition program that, in consultation with employees or applicable collective bargaining representatives, provides skills upgrades, apprenticeship and training programs, voluntary separation packages consistent with reasonable business practices, and job banks to coordinate and assist placement of employees into comparable employment at no less than the wage rates and substantially equivalent fringe benefits received before the transition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The costs resulting from subsection (1) include audited and verified employee-related restructuring costs that are incurred as a result of 2000 PA 141 or as a result of prior commission restructuring orders, including employee severance costs, employee retraining programs, early retirement programs, outplacement programs, and similar costs and programs, that have been approved and found to be prudently incurred by the commission.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That the acquiring entity or persons hire a sufficient number of nonsupervisory employees to safely and reliably operate and maintain the station, division, or unit by making offers of employment to the nonsupervisory workforce of the electric utility's division, business unit, generating station, or generating unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That the acquiring entity or persons not employ nonsupervisory employees from outside the electric utility's workforce unless offers of employment have been made to all qualified nonsupervisory employees of the acquired business unit or facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) That the acquiring entity or persons have a dispute resolution mechanism culminating in a final and binding decision by a neutral third party for resolving employee complaints or disputes over wages, fringe benefits, and working conditions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) That the acquiring entity or persons offer employment at no less than the wage rates and substantially equivalent fringe benefits and terms and conditions of employment that are in effect at the time of transfer of ownership of the division, business unit, generating station, or generating unit. The wage rates and substantially equivalent fringe benefits and terms and conditions of employment shall continue for at least 30 months from the time of the transfer of ownership unless the employees, or where applicable collective bargaining representative, and the new employer mutually agree to different terms and conditions of employment within that 30-month period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The electric utility shall offer a transition plan to those employees who are not offered jobs by the entity because the entity has a need for fewer workers. If there is litigation concerning the sale, or other transfer of ownership of the electric utility's divisions, business units, generating stations, or generating units, the 30-month period under subsection (3) begins on the date the acquiring entity or persons take control or management of the divisions, business units, generating stations, or generating units of the electric utility.</div>

In setting service quality and reliability standards, the commission shall consider safety, costs, local geography and weather, applicable codes, national electric industry practices, sound engineering judgment, and experience. The commission shall also include provisions to upgrade the service quality of distribution circuits that historically have experienced significantly below-average performance in relationship to similar distribution circuits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Annually, each jurisdictional utility or entity shall file its report with the commission detailing actions to be taken to comply with the service quality and reliability standards during the next calendar year and its performance in relation to the service quality and reliability standards during the prior calendar year. The annual reports shall contain that data as required by the commission, including the estimated cost of achieving improvements in the jurisdictional utility's or entity's performance with respect to the service quality and reliability standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The commission shall analyze the data to determine whether the jurisdictional entities are properly operating and maintaining their systems and take corrective action if needed.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Any standards or rules developed under this section shall be designed to do the following, as applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Establish different requirements for each customer class, whenever those different requirements are appropriate to carry out the provisions of this section, and to reflect different load and service characteristics of each customer class.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Consider the availability and associated cost of necessary equipment and labor required to maintain or upgrade distribution and generating facilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Ensure that the most cost-effective means of addressing power quality disturbances are promoted for each utility, including consideration of the installation of equipment or adoption of operating practices at the end-user's location. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Take into account the extent to which the benefits associated with achieving a specified standard or improvement are offset by the incremental capital, fuel, and operation and maintenance expenses associated with meeting the specified standard or improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Carefully consider the time frame for achieving a specified standard, taking into account the time required to implement needed investments or modify operating practices.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The commission shall also create benchmarks for individual jurisdictional entities within their rate-making process in order to accomplish the goals of this section to alleviate end-use customer power quality disturbances and promote power plant generating cost efficiency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The commission shall establish a method for gathering data from the industrial customer class to assist in monitoring power quality and reliability standards related to service characteristics of the industrial customer class.</div>

An entity that provides electric vehicle charging services is not a public utility and may not be prohibited from charging a customer for electric vehicle charging services on a volumetric basis, including for, but not limited to, charging a volumetric rate for the electricity transferred to the battery or other storage device. An entity that is a public utility that engages in the sale of electric vehicle charging services remains subject to regulation under this act and is not exempt from that regulation due solely to the provision of electric vehicle charging services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The commission shall not prohibit an electric utility from metering and billing its customers for services provided by the electric utility.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The commission shall establish minimum standards for the form and content of all disclosures, explanations, or sales information disseminated by a person selling electric service to ensure that the person provides adequate, accurate, and understandable information about the service that enables a customer to make an informed decision relating to the source and type of electric service purchased. The commission shall develop the standards to do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Not be unduly burdensome.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Not unnecessarily delay or inhibit the initiation and development of competition for electric generation service in any market.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Establish different requirements for disclosures, explanations, or sales information relating to different services or similar services to different classes of customers, whenever the different requirements are appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The commission shall require that all electric suppliers disclose in standardized, uniform format on the customer's bill with a bill insert, on customer contracts, or, for cooperatives, in periodicals issued by an association of rural electric cooperatives, information about the environmental characteristics of electricity products purchased by the customer, including all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The average fuel mix, including categories for oil, gas, coal, solar, hydroelectric, wind, biofuel, nuclear, solid waste incineration, biomass, and other fuel sources. If a source fits into the other category, the specific source must be disclosed. A regional average, determined by the commission, may be used only for that portion of the electricity purchased by the customer for which the fuel mix cannot be discerned. As used in this subdivision, "biomass" means dedicated crops grown for energy production and organic waste.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The average emissions, in pounds per megawatt hour, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen. An emissions default, determined by the commission, may be used if the regional average fuel mix is being disclosed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The average of the high-level nuclear waste generated in pounds per megawatt hour.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The regional average fuel mix and emissions profile as referenced in subdivisions (a), (b), and (c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The information required by subsection (2) shall be provided no more than twice annually, and be based on a rolling annual average. Emissions factors will be based on annual publicly available data by generation source.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) All of the information required to be provided under subsection (1) shall also be provided to the commission to be included on the commission's internet site.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The Michigan agency for energy shall establish the Michigan renewables energy program. The program shall be designed to inform customers in this state of the availability and value of using renewable energy generation and the potential of reduced pollution. The program shall also be designed to promote the use of existing renewable energy sources and encourage the development of new facilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) By July 3, 2009, each electric utility regulated by the commission shall file with the commission a plan for utilizing dispatchable customer-owned distributed generation within the context of its integrated resource planning process. Included in the utility's filing shall be proposals for enrolling and compensating customers for the utility's right to dispatch at-will the distributed generation assets owned by those customers and provisions requiring the customer to maintain these assets in a dispatchable condition. If an electric utility already has programs addressing the subject of the filing required under this subsection, the utility may refer to and take credit for those existing programs in its proposed plan.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If an entity purchases 1 or more divisions or business units, or generating stations or generating units, of a municipal electric utility, the acquiring entity's contract and agreements with the selling municipality shall require all of the following for a period of at least 30 months:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That the acquiring entity or persons hires a sufficient number of employees to safely and reliably operate and maintain the station, division, or unit by first making offers of employment to the workforce of the municipal electric utility's division, business unit, or generating unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That the acquiring entity or persons not employ employees from outside the municipal electric utility's workforce unless offers of employment have been made to all qualified employees of the acquired business unit or facility.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) That the acquiring entity or persons offer employment at no less than the wage rates and substantially equivalent fringe benefits and terms and conditions of employment that are in effect at the time of transfer of ownership of the division, business unit, generating station, or generating unit. The wage rates and substantially equivalent fringe benefits and terms and conditions of employment must continue for at least 30 months from the time of the transfer of ownership unless the employees, or where applicable collective bargaining representative, and the new employer mutually agree to different terms and conditions of the employment within that 30-month period.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>460.10gg Long-term industrial load rate; findings of commission.</B><P>Sec. 10gg.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the commission may establish long-term industrial load rates for industrial customers as provided in this section. An electric utility may propose a long-term industrial load rate in a general rate case filing or in a stand-alone proceeding. The commission shall approve the long-term industrial load rate proposed by the electric utility if the commission finds all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The cost of service for the capacity needed to serve the industrial customer under the proposed long-term industrial load rate is based on 1 or more designated power supply resources.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The proposed long-term industrial load rate requires the industrial customer to enter into a contract for a term equal to either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The term of the electric utility power purchase agreement or agreements, that must not be less than 15 years, for 1 or more designated power supply resources if the resources are an electric utility power purchase agreement or agreements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The expected remaining life of 1 or more designated power supply resources if the resources are utility-owned resources.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The proposed long-term industrial load rate requires that the industrial customer have an annual average electric demand of at least 200 megawatts at 1 site at the time the contract for a term is entered into, have an annual load factor of at least 75% at the time the contract for a term is entered into, and must demonstrate that the industrial customer would not purchase standard tariff service from the electric utility except under the long-term industrial load rate. The industrial customer demonstrates that it would not purchase standard tariff service from the electric utility except under the long-term industrial load rate if any of the following conditions exist:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The customer has available self-service power in a quantity equal to the contract demand level.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The customer, or an entity acting on the customer's behalf, has entered the applicable regional transmission organization's generation interconnection queue for a new generation resource that, if constructed, would qualify as self-service power in a quantity equal to the contract demand level. Entering the applicable regional transmission organization's interconnection queue means compliance with all applicable interconnection application requirements, such as payment of the application fee, disclosure of the technical requirements, payment of the definitive planning phase studying funding deposit, demonstration of site control, and payment of all other applicable per-megawatt fees or deposits, as required by the regional transmission organization.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The proposed long-term industrial load rate is only available to the industrial customer for service at a site where the industrial customer's annual average electric demand is at least 200 megawatts at the time the contract for a term is entered into. The contract for a term must be for a minimum of 100 megawatts of firm contracted capacity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the resource designated in a contract executed under the long-term industrial load rate is a utility-owned resource, then the proposed long-term industrial load rate is based on all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The electric utility's levelized cost of capacity, including fixed operation and maintenance expense, associated with the designated power supply resource at the time the customer contract is executed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The electric utility's actual variable fuel and actual variable operation and maintenance expense based on the customer's actual energy consumption and associated with the designated power supply resource.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The electric utility's actual energy and capacity market purchases, if any, based on the customer's actual consumption. The amount of capacity needed to serve a qualifying long-term industrial load is based on the capacity needed by the electric utility to comply with its regional transmission organization's load-serving resource requirement based on the amount of contractual firm and interruptible capacity supplied to the industrial customer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) If the designated resource associated with a contract executed under the long-term industrial load rate is an electric utility power purchase agreement or agreements, then the proposed long-term industrial load rate is based on recovering all costs associated with the designated power purchase agreement or agreements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The proposed long-term industrial load rate ensures that the electric utility recovers its direct costs to provide transmission and distribution service to the industrial customer based on the dedicated distribution service costs and transmission service costs incurred specifically to serve the industrial customer, as approved by the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A long-term industrial load rate may contain other terms and conditions proposed by the electric utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The commission shall approve any contract for a term proposed by an electric utility under a long-term industrial load rate authorized under this section if there is a net benefit to the electric utility's customers resulting from the industrial customer taking service under the long-term industrial load rate compared to the industrial customer not purchasing standard tariff service from the electric utility. In determining whether a net benefit exists, the commission may consider any benefit, including, but not limited to, benefits to customers as a result of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) System peak demand reduction due to ability to curtail, engage in demand response, or participate in federal load management programs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Avoidance of new production capacity costs and risks for other ratepayers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Ability to reduce system costs, such as by contributing to volt-var control.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the customer taking service under a long-term industrial load rate will contribute to the electric utility's fixed distribution or transmission costs that otherwise would have been recovered from the electric utility's other customers as compared to the customer not purchasing standard tariff service from the electric utility, then the commission shall determine that a net benefit exists under subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An electric utility may submit a proposal for a long-term industrial load rate and a proposed contract for a term under the proposed long-term industrial load rate in the same proceeding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If an electric utility proposes a long-term industrial load rate in a stand-alone proceeding, that proceeding must be conducted as a contested case under chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.288, and must be supported by a complete cost of service study, rate design, and proposed tariffs reflecting the impact of the long-term industrial load rate on other customer rates. A stand-alone proceeding filed under this section must not be expanded to result in any changes to the electric utility's overall revenue requirement. The commission shall issue a final order in a stand-alone proceeding conducted under this section no later than 270 days after an electric utility files an application requesting approval of a long-term industrial load rate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A contract for a term executed under a long-term industrial load rate approved under this section is considered reasonable and prudent for the contract's entire term.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A designated power supply resource that is an electric utility power purchase agreement or agreements may be a power purchase agreement or agreements with an affiliate of the electric utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A single customer may not aggregate load from multiple sites to meet the requirements of this section. Multiple customers may not aggregate load to meet the requirements of this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Annual load factor" means a load factor calculated as an average of the prior 12 monthly load factors. Each monthly load factor must be determined by dividing the customer's actual monthly kilowatt hours consumption by the product of the customer's monthly maximum on peak demand and the number of hours in the month.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Contract for a term" means an agreement executed between an electric utility and industrial customer under a long-term industrial load rate authorized by this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Electric utility power purchase agreement" means an agreement executed between an electric utility and an electric generation facility not owned by the electric utility for the purchase of energy and capacity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Long-term industrial load rate" means a rate approved by the commission under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) "Self-service power" means that term as defined in section 10a(4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) "Site" means an industrial site or contiguous industrial site or single commercial establishment. A site that is divided by an inland body of water or by a public highway, road, or street but that otherwise meets this definition meets the contiguous requirement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) "Standard tariff service" means the retail rates, terms, and conditions of service approved by the commission for service to customers.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the commission shall ensure the establishment of electric rates equal to the cost of providing service to each customer class. In establishing cost of service rates, the commission shall ensure that each class, or sub-class, is assessed for its fair and equitable use of the electric grid. If the commission determines that the impact of imposing cost of service rates on customers of an electric utility would have a material impact on customer rates, the commission may approve an order that implements those rates over a suitable number of years. The commission shall ensure that the cost of providing service to each customer class is based on the allocation of production-related costs based on using the 75-0-25 method of cost allocation and transmission costs based on using the 100% demand method of cost allocation. The commission may modify this method if it determines that this method of cost allocation does not ensure that rates are equal to the cost of service. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the commission may establish eligible low-income customer or eligible senior citizen customer rates. Upon filing of a rate increase request, a utility shall include proposed eligible low-income customer and eligible senior citizen customer rates and a method to allocate the revenue shortfall attributed to the implementation of those rates upon all customer classes. As used in this subsection, "eligible low-income customer" and "eligible senior citizen customer" mean those terms as defined in section 10t.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commission shall establish rate schedules that ensure that public and private schools, universities, and community colleges are charged retail electric rates that reflect the actual cost of providing service to those customers. Electric utilities regulated under this section shall file with the commission tariffs to ensure that public and private schools, universities, and community colleges are charged electric rates as provided in this subsection.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act shall provide a video service provider, broadband provider, wireless provider, or any telecommunication provider with nondiscriminatory access to its poles upon just and reasonable rates, terms, and conditions for their attachments. A cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act may deny a video service provider, broadband provider, wireless provider, or any telecommunication provider access to its poles on a nondiscriminatory basis for either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If there is insufficient capacity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For reasons of safety, reliability, or generally applicable engineering standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A video service provider, broadband provider, wireless provider, or any telecommunication provider and the cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act shall comply with the process for make-ready work under 47 USC 224 and the orders and regulations implementing 47 USC 224 adopted by the Federal Communications Commission. A good-faith estimate established by the cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act for any make-ready work for poles must include pole replacement if necessary. All make-ready costs must be based on actual costs not recovered through the annual recurring rate, with detailed documentation provided.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act may require a video service provider, broadband provider, wireless provider, or any telecommunication provider to execute an agreement for attachments on reasonable terms and conditions if that agreement is required of all others.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The attachment of facilities on the poles of a cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act by a video service provider, broadband provider, wireless provider, or any telecommunication provider must comply with the most recent applicable, nondiscriminatory safety and reliability standards adopted by the cooperative electric utility and with the National Electric Safety Code published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, in effect on the date of the attachment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A request for access to the poles of a cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act by a video service provider, broadband provider, wireless provider, or any telecommunication provider must be in writing. Access must be granted or denied within the time frame established by the regulations implementing 47 USC 224 adopted by the Federal Communications Commission. If access is denied, the cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act must confirm the denial in writing. The denial of access issued by the cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act must be specific, include all relevant evidence and information supporting the denial, and explain how that evidence and information relate to a denial of access for reasons of insufficient capacity, safety, reliability, or generally applicable engineering standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The costs of modifying a facility must be borne by all parties that obtain access to the facility as a result of the modification and by all parties that directly benefit from the modification. Each party that obtains access to the facility as a result of the modification and each party that directly benefits from the modification shall share proportionately in the cost of the modification. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a party with a preexisting attachment to the modified facility is considered to directly benefit from a modification if, after receiving notification of that modification, it adds to or modifies its attachment. A party with a preexisting attachment to a pole is not required to bear any of the costs of rearranging or replacing its attachment if that rearrangement or replacement is necessitated solely as a result of an additional attachment or the modification of an existing attachment sought by another party, unless the modification is necessitated by the cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act for an electric service, that includes, but is not limited to, smart grid technologies. If a party makes an attachment to the facility after the completion of the modification, that party shall share proportionately in the cost of the modification if that modification rendered the added attachment possible.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An attaching party shall obtain any necessary authorization before occupying public ways or private rights-of-way with its attachment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Attachment" means any wire, cable, antennae facility, or apparatus for the transmission of writing, signs, signals, pictures, sounds, or other forms of information installed by or on behalf of a provider of cable service or telecommunications service upon any pole owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by 1 or more cooperative electric utilities that are member-regulated under this act. Attachment includes, but is not limited to, a micro wireless facility or small cell wireless facility as those terms are defined in section 7 of the small wireless communications facilities deployment act, 2018 PA 365, MCL 460.1307, if either of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The micro wireless facility or small cell wireless facility is installed in the communications space, as that term is defined in the National Electrical Safety Code published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers as of the date of the installation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The micro wireless facility or small cell wireless facility is installed in or above the electric space, as that term is defined in the National Electrical Safety Code published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers as of the date of the installation, and that facility is installed and maintained by either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) A cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) A qualified contractor that meets both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(I) Generally applicable written contractor specifications of the cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(II) The definition of qualified as provided in the National Electrical Safety Code published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers as of the date of the installation or maintenance, as applicable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Broadband provider" means a person that provides broadband internet access transport services as that term is defined in section 2 of the metropolitan extension telecommunications rights-of-way oversight act, 2002 PA 48, MCL 484.3102.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>460.38b Access disputes under section 8a; jurisdiction; liability for damages; burden of proof; rebuttable presumption; court actions.</B><P>Sec. 8b.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Claims in law or equity for disputes under section 8a are governed by this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The Marquette County Circuit Court, the Ingham County Circuit Court, or the circuit court of the county where the cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act has located its headquarters has jurisdiction to determine all disputes arising under section 8a and grant remedies under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In a dispute governed under this section, the cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act is not liable for damages in law or equity unless the complainant establishes both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That a rate, term, or condition complained of is not just and reasonable or that a denial of access was unlawful.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) One of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) That the rate, term, or condition complained of is contained in a new pole attachment agreement or in a previously existing pole attachment agreement that is amended, renewed, or replaced by executing a new agreement on or after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) That there has been an unreasonable denial of access or unreasonable refusal to enter into a new, amended, renewed, or replacement pole attachment agreement on or after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The complainant has the burden of establishing a prima facie case that the rate, term, or condition is not just and reasonable or that the denial of access was unlawful. If, however, a cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act argues that the proposed rate is lower than its incremental costs, the cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act has the burden of establishing that the proposed rate is below the statutory minimum just and reasonable rate. In a case involving a denial of access, the cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act has the burden of establishing that the denial is lawful, once a prima facie case is established by the complainant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) In a dispute governed under this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that the charged rate is just and reasonable if the cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act can show that its charged rate does not exceed an annual recurring rate permitted under rules and regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission under 47 USC 224(d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the court determines that the rate, term, or condition complained of is not just and reasonable, it may prescribe a just and reasonable rate, term, or condition and may do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Terminate the unjust and unreasonable rate, term, or condition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Require entry into a pole attachment agreement on reasonable rates, terms, and conditions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Require access to poles as provided under section 8a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Substitute in the pole attachment agreement the just and reasonable rate, term, or condition established by the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Order a refund, or payment, if appropriate. The refund or payment may not exceed the difference between the actual amount paid under the unjust and unreasonable rate, term, or condition and the amount that would have been paid under the rate, term, or condition established by the court for the period at issue, but not to exceed 2 years.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>460.39 Areas served and line extension disputes involving member-regulated cooperative electric utility and electric utility; jurisdiction of commission; procedures.</B><P>Sec. 9.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The commission shall retain jurisdiction over all areas served and line extension disputes involving a cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act and a regulated electric utility. This act does not limit the commission's jurisdiction over areas served and line extension disputes granted to the commission under any other law or statute. A cooperative electric utility that is member-regulated under this act shall operate in compliance with R 460.3411 of the Michigan administrative code, regarding extension of electric service in areas served by 2 or more utilities. The commission shall continue to possess all jurisdiction and authority necessary to administer and enforce the provisions of 1929 PA 69, MCL 460.501 to 460.506, and R 460.3411 of the Michigan administrative code with respect to member-regulated cooperative electric utilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) When a member-regulated cooperative is required to give notice to the commission and any affected electric utility of its intention to extend service to a prospective customer as required under R 460.3411 of the Michigan administrative code, the notice shall also include the charge to extend service, if any, and the rate or rates for the service offered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the electric utility, after being notified under R 460.3411 of the Michigan administrative code, believes that a cooperative that is member-regulated under this act either proposes to unlawfully extend service to a prospective customer or has offered an unjustly preferential charge for extension of service or unjust rate to a prospective customer and that prospective customer could otherwise be served by the electric utility pursuant to the commission's rules for extension of electric service, the affected electric utility may file an objection with the commission. Any objection allowed under this subsection shall be filed within 60 days from the date notice of the intent to extend service was provided by the cooperative. If an objection is filed by the utility notified under R 460.3411 of the Michigan administrative code, the commission shall first determine whether the complaining utility or the cooperative, or both, have the lawful right to provide service to the prospective customer and then, if necessary, determine whether the charges or rates offered by the cooperative are just and reasonable based on the cooperative's cost of service. That determination shall be made at a contested case proceeding conducted pursuant to chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287. A cooperative's charges or rates offered to a prospective customer shall be considered just and reasonable upon a showing by the cooperative that the charges to extend service to a prospective customer and the rates offered are equivalent to the cooperative's charges to extend service and rates charged to other similarly situated customers served by the cooperative. If the cooperative does not provide service to other similarly situated customers, the cooperative shall demonstrate that its charges to extend service and the rates offered to the prospective customer are just and reasonable based on the cooperative's cost of providing service to the prospective customer, consistent with industry practice. At the choice of the customer, either the electric utility or the member-regulated cooperative may provide service to the prospective customer until the commission determines the appropriate service provider.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A municipally owned utility that has entered into a service area agreement with a cooperative in accordance with section 10y(6) of 1939 PA 3, MCL 460.10y, may file an action in the circuit court in the district where the cooperative's main office is located alleging that a rate or charge offered by the cooperative is unjust and unreasonable. An action filed under this subsection shall be filed within 60 days after the municipally owned utility becomes aware of the rate or charge. In determining whether a rate or charge is just and reasonable, the circuit court shall use the standards set forth in subsection (3) for determinations made by the commission. If the circuit court determines that the rate or charge offered to the prospective customer is unjust or unreasonable, the court shall order the cooperative to assess the appropriate rate or charge to the prospective customer. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, if the circuit court issues an order under this subsection, any prospective customer directly affected by the order shall be permitted by the cooperative to switch service to the objecting municipally owned utility, if the affected customer has given the cooperative written notice of the customer's intent to switch within 60 days from the date of the court's order and the objecting municipally owned utility agrees to pay the cooperative the reasonable value, as determined by the circuit court, of its facilities that will continue to be used to serve the customer by the objecting municipally owned utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the commission finds that an electric utility or cooperative providing temporary service to a customer under this act is not a lawful service provider for that customer, the commission shall order service to that customer transferred to the lawful provider. That order shall require the provider acquiring the customer to pay for the reasonable cost of the facilities, as determined by the commission, constructed to serve the transferred customer, which will be used by the acquiring provider to serve the transferred customer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the commission finds that the cooperative is a lawful service provider but the cooperative's charges to extend service, if any, or the rates offered to the prospective customer are unjust or unreasonable, the commission shall order the cooperative to assess the appropriate charges to extend service and assess the appropriate rates to the prospective customer. Notwithstanding rules to the contrary, if the commission issues an order under this subsection, any prospective customer directly affected by the commission's order shall be permitted by the cooperative to switch service to the objecting electric utility, if the affected customer has given the cooperative written notice of the customer's intent to switch within 60 days from the date of the commission's order and the objecting electric utility agrees to pay the cooperative the reasonable value, as determined by the commission, of its facilities that will continue to be used to serve the customer by the objecting electric utility.</div>

<P>Sec. 4.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In addition to the rights, powers and duties vested in and imposed on said commission by the preceding section, its jurisdiction shall be deemed to extend to and include the control and regulation, including the fixing of rates and charges, of all public utilities within this state, producing, transmitting, delivering or furnishing steam for heating or power, or gas for heating or lighting purposes for the public use. Subject to the provisions of this act the said commission shall have the same measure of authority with reference to such utilities as is granted and conferred with respect to railroads and railroad companies under the various provisions of the statutes creating the Michigan railroad commission and defining its powers and duties. The power and authority granted by this act shall not extend to, or include, any power of regulation or control of any municipally owned utility; and it shall be the duty of said commission on the request of any city or village to give advice and render such assistance as may be reasonable and expedient with respect to the operation of any utility owned and operated by such city or village. In no case shall the commission have power to change or alter the rates or charges fixed in, or regulated by, any franchise or agreement heretofore or hereafter granted or made by any city, village or township. It shall be competent for any municipality and any public utility operating within the limits of said municipality, whether such utility is operating under the terms of a franchise or otherwise, to join in submitting to the commission any question involving the fixing or determination of rates or charges, or the making of rules or conditions of service, and the commission shall thereupon be empowered, and it shall be its duty to make full investigation as to all matters so submitted and to fix and establish such reasonable maximum rates and charges, and prescribe such rules and conditions of service and make such determination and order relative thereto as shall be just and reasonable. Such order when so made shall have like force and effect as other orders made under the provisions of this act. In any case where a franchise under which a utility is, or has been, operated, including street railways, shall have heretofore expired or shall hereafter expire, the municipality shall have the right to petition the commission to fix the rates and charges of said utility in accordance with the provisions of this act, or to make complaint as herein provided with reference to any practice, service or regulation of such utility, and thereupon said commission shall have full jurisdiction in the premises.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In addition to the reports now required to be made by any public utility under the laws of the state relating to the Michigan railroad commission, it shall be competent for the public utilities commission to require the making of such additional and further reports and the supplying of such data as is reasonably necessary for the proper performance of the powers and duties hereby contemplated. Any report required to be made by a utility operated and controlled by a corporation, joint stock company or association shall be verified by the affidavit of the president and secretary thereof. In all other cases such verification shall be made by the owner, or 1 of them, or by the general manager. Said commission shall have power and authority to make, adopt and enforce rules and regulations for the conduct of its business and the proper discharge of its functions hereunder, and all persons dealing with the commission or interested in any matter or proceedings pending before it shall be bound by such rules and regulations. The commission shall also have authority to make and prescribe regulations for the conducting of the business of public utilities, subject to the jurisdiction thereof, and it shall be the duty of every corporation, joint stock company, association or individual owning, managing or operating any such utility to obey such rules and regulations. Any such corporation, joint stock company, association or individual refusing or neglecting so to do, or refusing or neglecting to make any report required hereunder, shall be liable to a penalty of not less than 100 dollars nor more than 1,000 dollars; and the officer or individual in default shall also be deemed to be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be subject to a fine of not less than 10 dollars nor more than 1,000 dollars, or to imprisonment in the county jail not more than 6 months, or both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upon complaint in writing that any rate, classification, regulation or practice charged, made or observed by any public utility is unjust, inaccurate, or improper, to the prejudice of the complainant, the commission shall proceed to investigate the matter. The procedure to be followed in all such cases shall be prescribed by rule of the commission: Provided, however, That in all cases reasonable notice shall be given to the parties concerned as to the time and place of hearing. An investigation of any such complaint, and the formal hearing thereon, if such is deemed necessary, may be held at any place within the state and by any member or members of the commission, or by any duly authorized representative thereof. Witnesses may be summoned and the production of books, and records before the commission, or the member, or any duly authorized representative thereof conducting the hearing, may be required. Any witness summoned to appear or to produce papers at any such hearing, who neglects or refuses so to do shall be deemed guilty of a contempt. It shall be competent for the commission in any such case to make application to any circuit court of the state setting forth the facts of the matter. Thereupon said court shall have the same power and authority to punish for the contempt and to compel obedience to the subpoena or order of the commission as though such person were in contempt of such court or had neglected or refused to obey its lawful order or process. The taking of testimony at such hearing shall be governed by the rules of the commission: Provided, That at the request of either party a record of such testimony shall be taken and preserved. Upon the completion of any such hearing, the commission shall have authority to make an order or decree dismissing the complaint or directing that the rate, charge, practice or other matter complained of, shall be removed, modified or altered, as the commission deems just, equitable and in accordance with the rights of the parties concerned. For attending on any such hearing, any witness summoned by the commission shall be entitled to the same fees as are, or may be, provided by law for attending the circuit court in any civil matter or proceedings, which said fees shall be paid out of the general fund in the treasury of the state. All claims for such fees shall be approved by the secretary, or by some member of the commission, and shall be audited and allowed by the board of state auditors.</DIV>

The department of state police shall not audit any carrier by water whose proposed rate, fare, charge, or tariff is less than the rates, fares, charges, or tariffs charged by comparable carriers by water. The department of state police may approve a proposed rate, fare, charge, or tariff of any carrier by water that primarily transports vehicles directly between 2 state highways that is more than the rates, fares, charges, or tariffs charged by comparable carriers by water if, based on justification submitted by the carrier by water, the department of state police finds the rate, fare, charge, or tariff is reasonable. If the department of state police determines that a rate, fare, charge, or tariff is not reasonable, the department of state police shall, within 15 days after that determination, meet with the carrier by water and explain the reasons for its determination. Any carrier by water that meets the criteria of this section is deemed an instrumentality of the state.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 7.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The commission shall investigate each complaint against an electric utility submitted in writing by a consumer or a city, village, or township concerning the price of the electricity sold and delivered, the service rendered, or any other matter of complaint. The commission's agents, examiners, inspectors, engineers, and accountants may inspect the system and method used in transmitting and supplying electricity and examine the electric utility's books and papers pertaining to transmitting and supplying electricity, services rendered, or any other matter of complaint.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The commission shall cause a notice of the complaint with a copy of the complaint to be served on the electric utility complained of or affected by the complaint. The electric utility has the right to a hearing in respect to the complaint. After investigation and hearing, the commission may by order fix the price of electricity to be charged by the electric utility within lawful limits. The electric utility shall receive notice of the price fixed by the commission and shall charge that fixed price until the commission changes the fixed price. The commission may establish by order rules and conditions of service that are just and reasonable. In determining the price, the commission shall consider and give due weight to all lawful elements necessary to determine the price to be fixed for supplying electricity, including cost, reasonable return on the fair value of all property used in the service, depreciation, obsolescence, risks of business, value of service to the consumer, the connected load, the hours of the day when used, and the quantity used each month. However, the commission shall not change or alter the price fixed in or regulated by or under a franchise granted by a city, village, or township.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If identical or substantially identical rates are established in 2 or more contiguous cities, villages, townships, or communities served or whose inhabitants are served by the same electric utility, the territory served shall be treated as a unit for fixing rates. A rate shall not be changed with respect to 1 or more of the cities, villages, townships, or communities so as to establish a rate difference within the territory served, unless it is shown that the continuance of the identical or substantially identical rate or rates will work substantial hardship to a city, village, township, person, firm, or corporation affected or unless otherwise provided by law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The rates of an electric utility shall be just and reasonable and a consumer shall not be charged more or less than other consumers are charged for like contemporaneous service rendered under similar circumstances and conditions. An electric utility doing business within this state shall not, directly or indirectly by a special rate, rebate, draw-back, or other device, charge, demand, collect, or receive from a person, partnership, or corporation, a greater or lesser compensation for a service rendered than the electric utility charges, demands, collects, or receives from any other person, partnership, or corporation for rendering, a like contemporaneous service.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A person, partnership, or corporation shall not, directly or indirectly, ask, demand, or accept a rebate, draw-back, or other device by which the person, partnership, or corporation shall obtain electric service for a rate less than that charged others in like circumstances.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Rate-making pursuant to this act is subject to the electric transmission line certification act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The commission may promulgate rules for the conduct of its business and the proper discharge of its functions under this act, pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, being sections 24.201 to 24.328 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. A person dealing with the commission or interested in a matter or proceeding pending before the commission is bound by those rules.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The start date and time of blasting or excavation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Whether the proposed blasting or excavation will be completed within 21 days after the start date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A ticket is valid for 21 days from the start date of the excavation or blasting on the ticket as identified by the excavator, except that a ticket is valid for 180 days from the start date if the dig notice indicates that the proposed excavation or blasting will not be completed within 21 days from the start date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An excavator shall comply with the notification system procedures and all requirements of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, before blasting or excavating in a caution zone, an excavator shall expose all marked facilities in the caution zone by soft excavation. If conditions make complete exposure of the facility impractical, an excavator shall consult with the facility owner or facility operator to reach agreement on how to protect the facility. For excavations in a caution zone parallel to a facility, an excavator shall use soft excavation at intervals as often as reasonably necessary to establish the precise location of the facility. An excavator may use power tools and power equipment in a caution zone only after the facilities are exposed or the precise location of the facilities is established. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An excavator shall provide support or bracing of facilities or excavation walls in an excavation or blasting area that are reasonably necessary for protection of the facilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An excavator shall provide notification to the notification system if facility markings are destroyed or covered by excavation or blasting activities or if a ticket expires before the commencement of excavation.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) An excavator shall provide notification to the notification system requesting additional assistance if the location of a marked facility within the approximate location cannot be determined.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An excavator shall provide immediate additional notice to the notification system and stop excavation in the immediate vicinity if the excavator has reason to suspect the presence of an unmarked facility due to any 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Visible evidence of a facility with no marks visible.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Lack of a positive response to a ticket.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A positive response from a facility owner or facility operator indicating the presence of a facility with no marks visible.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If an excavator contacts or damages a facility, the excavator shall provide immediate notice to the facility owner or facility operator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If an excavator damages a facility resulting in the escape of any flammable, toxic, or corrosive gas or liquid, or endangering life, health, or property, the excavator shall call 9-1-1 and provide immediate notice to the facility owner or facility operator. The excavator shall also take reasonable measures to protect the excavator, those in immediate danger, the general public, and the environment until the facility owner or facility operator, or emergency first responders, have arrived and taken control of the site.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) An excavator shall provide prompt emergency notice to the notification system for any proposed excavation or blasting in an emergency. In an emergency, blasting or excavation required to address the conditions of the emergency may be performed as the emergency conditions reasonably require, subject to the provisions in this act for emergency notice and marking facilities in response to an emergency notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) If the location of a proposed excavation or blasting cannot be described in a manner sufficient to enable the facility owner or facility operator to ascertain the precise tract or parcel involved, an excavator shall provide white lining in advance of submitting a ticket or additional assistance to the facility owner or facility operator on reasonable request to identify the area of the proposed excavation or blasting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) For purposes of this section, notice to the notification system constitutes notice to all facility owners or facility operators regarding facilities located in the area of the proposed excavation or blasting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) Except as otherwise provided in this act, an excavator may conduct excavation in a safe zone using power equipment without establishing the precise location of any facilities.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Whether a separate entity may be able to finance the cost of projects in a more economic and efficient manner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Whether financial market acceptance may be enhanced if 1 entity is responsible for issuing and selling all of the bonds required for a project or projects in a timely and orderly manner and with a uniform credit rating, instead of multiple entities marketing their separate issues of bonds.</div>

The contractual obligation shall not constitute an indebtedness of the municipality within a statutory or charter debt limitation. If the joint agency issues bonds in anticipation of payments, appropriations, or contributions to be made to the joint agency pursuant to contract by a political subdivision having the power to levy and collect ad valorem taxes, the political subdivision may obligate itself by the contract, and thereupon may levy a tax on all taxable property within the political subdivision, which tax as to rate or amount will not be subject to limitation, as provided in section 6 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963, for contract obligations in anticipation of which bonds are issued to provide sufficient money to fulfill its contractual obligation to the joint agency. The contract is not subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The bonds may be:</DIV>

The joint agency may agree to repay an advance or pay for the property within a period of not more than 10 years, from the proceeds of its bonds or from other funds legally available for that purpose, with or without interest as may be agreed at the time of the advance or delivery. The obligation of the joint agency to make the repayment or payment may be evidenced by contract or note, which contract or note may pledge a source of payment determined by the joint agency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A municipality desiring to enter into a contract under this section pledging the full faith and credit of the municipality shall authorize, by resolution of its governing body, the execution of the contract. Subsequent to the adoption of the resolution a notice of the contract shall be published in a newspaper of general publication in the municipality, which notice shall state:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That the governing body has adopted a resolution authorizing execution of the contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The purpose of the contract.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The contract may be executed and delivered by the municipality upon approval by its governing body without a vote of the electors, but the contract shall not become effective until the expiration of 45 days after the date of publication of the notice. If within the 45-day period a petition signed by at least 10% or 15,000, whichever is the lesser, of the registered electors residing within the limits of the municipality is filed with the clerk of the municipality requesting a referendum upon the contract, the contract shall not become effective until approved by the vote of a majority of the electors of the municipality qualified to vote and voting on the question at a general or special election, which election shall be held within 180 days after the filing of a petition. When a contract described in this section is to be entered into by any township only on behalf of the unincorporated area of the township, only the registered electors residing within the unincorporated area of the township shall be qualified to sign the petition and vote at the election.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An electric provider described in subsection (3) is required to achieve a renewable energy credit portfolio equal only to the electric provider's maximum renewable energy credit portfolio requirement if the electric provider's maximum renewable energy credit portfolio requirement is less than the number of renewable energy credits required to comply with the applicable standard in subsection (1). If the electric provider is a multistate electric provider, and the electric provider's maximum renewable energy credit portfolio requirement is less than the number of renewable energy credits required to comply with the applicable standard in subsection (1), then the electric provider is required to achieve a renewable energy credit portfolio equal only to the electric provider's maximum renewable energy credit portfolio requirement if all of the following requirements are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The electric provider's electricity generation systems located within this state produce energy exceeding the electric provider's electricity sales in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) All of the electric provider's electricity generation systems located within this state are clean energy systems.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) All of the renewable energy credits generated in this state are used by the electric provider toward compliance with the renewable energy credit portfolio as calculated under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Renewable energy and clean energy generated in this state equal to or exceeding the provider's electricity sales in this state are not used by the provider or any other provider to comply with any similar standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Each electric provider shall meet the renewable energy credit standard, subject to subsection (3), with renewable energy credits obtained by any of the following means:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Generating electricity from renewable energy systems for sale to retail customers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Purchasing or otherwise acquiring renewable energy and capacity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Purchasing or otherwise acquiring renewable energy credits without the associated renewable energy or capacity. Renewable energy credits acquired under this subdivision shall be produced within the territory of the regional transmission organization of which the electric provider is a member, and, except for a municipally owned electric utility, shall not exceed 5% of an electric provider's renewable energy credits annually used to comply with the renewable energy standard. Renewable energy credits acquired under this subdivision are not subject to the requirements of section 29 and shall not be used to comply with the renewable energy standard after 2035.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For an electric provider whose rates are regulated by the commission, the electric provider shall submit a contract entered into for the purposes of subsection (5) to the commission for review and approval. If the commission approves the contract, it is considered consistent with the electric provider's renewable energy plan. The commission shall not approve a contract based on an unsolicited proposal unless the commission determines that the unsolicited proposal provides opportunities that may not otherwise be available or commercially practical through a competitive bid process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An electric provider that has achieved annual incremental energy savings of greater than 2% under an energy waste reduction plan approved under section 73 may substitute energy waste reduction credits for renewable energy credits otherwise required to meet the renewable energy credit standard if the substitution is approved by the commission. Under this subsection, energy waste reduction credits shall not be used by a provider to meet more than 10% of the renewable energy credit standard. One renewable energy credit shall be awarded per 1 energy waste reduction credit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If an electric provider whose rates are regulated by the commission enters into a purchase power agreement for renewable energy resources or a third-party contract for an energy storage system or clean energy system with an entity that is not an affiliate, the commission shall authorize an annual financial incentive for the electric provider. The financial incentive shall be calculated as the product of contract payments in that year multiplied by the electric provider's pre-tax weighted average cost of permanent capital comprised of long-term debt obligations and equity of the electric provider's total capital structure as determined by the commission's final order in the electric provider's most recent general rate case. The pre-tax weighted average cost of permanent capital used to calculate the financial incentive shall not be fixed throughout the entire term of the contract at the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital applicable in the first year but shall be updated based on the commission's final order in each succeeding general rate case for the electric provider.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to subsections (2) to (4), a renewable energy system that is the source of renewable energy credits used to satisfy the renewable energy standards shall be located as described in either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Anywhere in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Outside of this state, but only if the electric provider includes the capacity from the renewable energy system toward meeting its resource adequacy obligations to the applicable regional transmission organization. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subsection (1) does not require an electric provider to procure firm transmission rights to ensure deliverability to the resource adequacy zone where the load is served. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Subsection (1) does not apply if electricity generated from the renewable energy system is sold by a not-for-profit entity located in Indiana, Ohio, or Wisconsin to a municipally owned electric utility in this state or cooperative electric utility in this state, and the electricity is not being used to meet another state's standard for renewable energy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Renewable energy credits produced in the continental United States and owned by a customer of an electric provider may be utilized by the electric provider to meet the renewable energy credit standard if the electric customer chooses to report renewable energy credits to its electric provider as attributable to the customer's electric load. Any renewable energy credits reported by an electric customer for use by its electric provider shall be applied to the electric customer's proportional share of a renewable energy credit portfolio requirement for the year in which renewable energy credits are used to comply with the renewable energy credit standard. On an annual basis, not later than December 1, the electric customer shall provide the electric provider with an update on its 5-year forecast and notify the electric provider of the expected amount of renewable energy credits to be used toward compliance in the coming year. If the projected amount of renewable energy credits available for compliance will be less than what the electric customer projected in its 5-year forecast, then the electric customer shall notify the electric provider at least 5 years before the compliance year in which a projected reduction in renewable energy credits will occur. If the electric provider's rates are regulated by the commission and the electric provider uses the reported renewable energy credits to comply with the renewable energy credit portfolio standard, the electric provider shall grant the customer an appropriate cost-based rate credit against the cost of compliance under section 47. As used in this subsection, "customer of an electric provider" or "customer" means any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A customer taking service under a rate approved by the commission under section 10gg of 1939 PA 3, MCL 460.10gg. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A customer whose manufacturing complex is described in section 10a(4)(c) of 1939 PA 3, MCL 460.10a, and that takes service for a portion of its load from an alternative electric supplier licensed under section 10a of 1939 PA 3, MCL 460.10a, on the effective date of the amendatory act that added section 51. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A customer of a municipally owned electric utility on the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection if the customer represents at least 25% of the municipally owned electric utility's peak load.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Renewable energy credits that qualify under subsection (1) and are owned by members of a public body corporate established under the urban cooperation act of 1967, 1967 (Ex Sess) PA 7, MCL 124.501 to 124.512, on or before December 1, 2022, if those members are part of Michigan's educational community and take service from an alternative electric supplier licensed under section 10a of 1939 PA 3, MCL 460.10a, may be utilized by the members' electric provider to meet the renewable energy credit standards if the members choose to report renewable energy credits to the electric provider as attributable to the electric load of members of the cooperative. Any renewable energy credits reported by a member of the cooperative for use by a provider to the members of the cooperative shall be applied to the member's proportional share of a renewable energy credit portfolio requirement for the year in which renewable energy credits are used to comply with the renewable energy credit standard.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Upon petition by an electric provider, the commission may, upon a showing of good cause, grant an extension of a renewable energy credit portfolio deadline under section 28. Each extension shall not exceed 2 years. An extension of a deadline does not affect a subsequent deadline.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In a petition under subsection (1), an electric provider must include a plan for resolving the barrier to compliance and must make a showing of good cause by demonstrating any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Despite all commercially reasonable efforts by the electric provider to comply with the deadline, compliance is not practically feasible for reasons that may include, but are not limited to, zoning, siting, permitting, supply chains, transmission interconnection, labor shortages, delays in project deliverability from developers, or unanticipated load growth. Issuing a request for proposals to purchase renewable energy and not receiving a commercially viable offer creates a rebuttable presumption that compliance with the deadline is not practically feasible.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Compliance would be excessively costly to customers despite commercially reasonable efforts by the electric provider to contain costs. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Compliance would result in a deficiency in meeting resource adequacy requirements in the electric provider's service territory.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Compliance would result in a local grid reliability issue. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Upon granting an additional extension for a particular renewable energy credit portfolio deadline beyond the first 2 extensions, the commission shall notify the speaker of the house, the majority leader of the senate, and the chairpersons of the committees of the legislature having jurisdiction over energy issues that it has granted an additional extension to the electric provider and the reasons for the extension.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The commission shall consider all actual costs reasonably and prudently incurred in good faith to implement an amended renewable energy plan by an electric provider whose rates are regulated by the commission to be a cost of service to be recovered by the electric provider. An electric provider whose rates are regulated by the commission shall recover through its retail electric rates all of the electric provider's incremental costs of compliance beginning when the electric provider's amended renewable energy plan is approved by the commission. The recovery shall include, but is not limited to, the electric provider's authorized rate of return on equity for costs approved under this section. The authorized rate of return on equity for costs of any renewable energy system approved through the electric provider's amended renewable energy plan to comply with the renewable energy standard in effect before the effective date of the amendatory act that added section 51 shall remain fixed at the rate of return and debt-to-equity ratio that was in effect when the electric provider's amended renewable energy plan that first included the renewable energy system was approved by the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Incremental costs of compliance shall be calculated as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Determine the sum of the following costs to the extent those costs are reasonable and prudent and not already approved for recovery in electric rates as of October 6, 2008:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Capital, operating, and maintenance costs of renewable energy systems, including property taxes, insurance, and return on equity associated with an electric provider's renewable energy systems, including the electric provider's renewable energy portfolio established to achieve compliance with the renewable energy standards and any additional renewable energy systems that are built or acquired by the electric provider to maintain compliance with the renewable energy standards. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Financing costs attributable to capital, operating, and maintenance costs of capital facilities associated with renewable energy systems used to meet the renewable energy standard.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Costs that are not otherwise recoverable in rates approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and that are related to the infrastructure required to bring renewable energy systems used to achieve compliance with the renewable energy standards on to the transmission system, including interconnection and substation costs for renewable energy systems used to meet the renewable energy standard.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Ancillary service costs determined by the commission to be necessarily incurred to ensure the quality and reliability of renewable energy used to meet the renewable energy standards, regardless of the ownership of a renewable energy system. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Except to the extent the costs are allocated under a different subparagraph, all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) The costs of renewable energy credits purchased under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) The costs of contracts described in former section 33(1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(C) The financial compensation mechanism for all renewable energy contracts established under section 28(8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) Expenses incurred as a result of state or federal governmental actions related to renewable energy systems attributable to the renewable energy standards, including changes in tax or other law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vii) Any additional electric provider costs determined by the commission to be necessarily incurred to ensure the quality and reliability of renewable energy used to meet the renewable energy standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Subtract from the sum of costs not already included in electric rates determined under subdivision (a) the sum of the following revenues:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Revenue derived from the sale of environmental attributes associated with the generation of renewable energy attributable to the renewable energy standards. Such revenue shall not be considered in determining power supply cost recovery factors under section 6j of 1939 PA 3, MCL 460.6j.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Interest on regulatory liabilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Tax credits specifically designed to promote renewable energy. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Revenue derived from the provision of renewable energy to retail electric customers subject to a power supply cost recovery clause under section 6j of 1939 PA 3, MCL 460.6j, of an electric provider whose rates are regulated by the commission. After providing an opportunity for a contested case hearing for an electric provider whose rates are regulated by the commission, the commission shall annually establish a price per megawatt hour. An electric provider whose rates are regulated by the commission may at any time petition the commission to revise the price. In setting the price per megawatt hour under this subparagraph, the commission shall consider factors, including, but not limited to, projected capacity, energy, maintenance, and operating costs; information filed under section 6j of 1939 PA 3, MCL 460.6j; and information from wholesale markets, including, but not limited to, locational marginal pricing. This price shall be multiplied by the sum of the number of megawatt hours of renewable energy used to maintain compliance with the renewable energy standard. The product shall be considered a booked cost of purchased and net interchanged power transactions under section 6j of 1939 PA 3, MCL 460.6j. For energy purchased by such an electric provider under a renewable energy contract, the price shall be the lower of the amount established by the commission or the actual price paid and shall be multiplied by the number of megawatt hours of renewable energy purchased. The resulting value shall be considered a booked cost of purchased and net interchanged power under section 6j of 1939 PA 3, MCL 460.6j.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Revenue from wholesale renewable energy sales. Such revenue shall not be considered in determining power supply cost recovery factors under section 6j of 1939 PA 3, MCL 460.6j.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) Any additional electric provider revenue considered by the commission to be attributable to the renewable energy standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vii) Any revenues recovered in rates for renewable energy costs that are included under subdivision (a).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The commission shall authorize an electric provider whose rates are regulated by the commission to spend in any given month more to comply with this act and implement an amended renewable energy plan than the revenue actually generated by the revenue recovery mechanism. An electric provider whose rates are regulated by the commission shall recover its commission approved pre-tax rate of return on regulatory assets during the appropriate period. An electric provider whose rates are regulated by the commission shall record interest on regulatory liabilities at the average short-term borrowing rate available to the electric provider during the appropriate period. Any regulatory assets or liabilities resulting from the recovery of costs of renewable energy attributable to renewable energy standards through the power supply cost recovery clause under section 6j of 1939 PA 3, MCL 460.6j, shall continue to be reconciled under that section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The incremental costs of compliance as that term is used in section 61 shall be calculated as provided in this section.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>460.1077 Incremental energy savings; goals; determination; calculations; basis; substitution.</B><P>Sec. 77.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to section 97, each year beginning 2026, an electric provider's energy waste reduction programs under this subpart shall collectively achieve incremental energy savings equivalent to 1.5% of total retail electricity sales in megawatt hours in the preceding year, with an average life of at least 8 years for energy waste reduction measures. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) As a goal, an electric provider's energy waste reduction programs under this subpart should collectively achieve incremental energy savings equivalent to 2% of total retail electricity sales in megawatt hours in the preceding year, with an average life of at least 8 years for energy waste reduction measures. This goal should be included in the electric provider's integrated resource plan modeling scenarios under section 6t of 1939 PA 3, MCL 460.6t.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An electric provider whose rates are regulated by the commission shall not include electrification measures in the calculation of its energy waste reduction savings for purposes of meeting the energy waste reduction standard or for determining eligibility for incentives under section 75. If an electric provider whose rates are not regulated by the commission implements an efficient electrification measures plan as authorized by section 72, any reduction in energy consumption at a customer premises from the conversion of fossil fuel use to electric equipment qualifies as incremental energy savings for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2). The reduction in energy consumption shall be calculated as provided in section 72(2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If an electric provider has a program to promote the installation of qualifying cold-climate air-source heat pumps or qualifying ground-source heat pumps and includes incentives to improve building envelope energy efficiency for participating homes, the electric provider may count the savings from the building envelope efficiency improvements toward each year's annual savings requirement, regardless of the original heating fuel source, subject to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Savings from building envelope efficiency improvements for preexisting propane heating shall be credited to electricity savings at a conversion rate of 27 kWh per gallon of propane saved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Savings from building envelope efficiency improvements for preexisting oil heating shall be credited to electricity savings at a conversion rate of 40 kWh per gallon of fuel oil saved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Savings for building envelope efficiency improvements for preexisting natural gas heating shall be credited to electricity savings at a conversion rate of 29 kWh per therm of gas saved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If an electric provider uses load management to achieve energy savings under its energy waste reduction plan, the minimum energy savings required under subsection (1) shall be adjusted by an amount such that the ratio of the minimum energy savings to the sum of actual expenditures for implementing its approved energy waste reduction plan and the load management expenditures remains constant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A natural gas provider may claim natural gas savings resulting from investments in qualifying efficient electrification measures, or investments in building envelope efficiency improvements made as part of projects involving qualifying efficient electrification measures, if the savings are not also counted toward an electric utility's savings goals. When a natural gas provider and an electric provider are both involved in a qualifying efficient electrification measures project, including a project that involves both building envelope efficiency and qualifying efficient electrification measures, the providers shall work together to reach an agreement on how savings claims will be allocated between the providers. The commission may adopt standards or default provisions for the allocation of savings claims between providers that apply if the providers are unable to reach an agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Subject to section 97, a natural gas provider's energy waste reduction program under this subpart shall achieve the following: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Each year through 2025, incremental energy savings equivalent to 0.75% of total retail natural gas sales in decatherms or equivalent MCFs in the preceding year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Each year beginning 2026, incremental energy savings equivalent to 0.875% of total retail natural gas sales in decatherms or equivalent MCFs in the preceding year with an average savings life of at least 10 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Incremental energy savings under subsection (1) or (7) for a year shall be determined for a provider by adding the energy savings expected to be achieved by energy waste reduction measures implemented during that year under any energy waste reduction programs consistent with the provider's energy waste reduction plan. The energy savings expected to be achieved shall be determined using a savings database or other savings measurement approach as determined reasonable by the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) For purposes of calculations under subsection (1) or (7), total retail electricity or natural gas sales in a year shall be based on 1 of the following at the option of the provider as specified in its energy waste reduction plan:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The number of weather-normalized megawatt hours or decatherms or equivalent MCFs sold by the provider to retail customers in this state during the year preceding the year for which incremental energy savings are being calculated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The average number of megawatt hours or decatherms or equivalent MCFs sold by the provider during the 3 years preceding the year for which incremental energy savings are being calculated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) For any year after 2012, an electric provider may substitute renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generated that year from a renewable energy system constructed after October 6, 2008, load management that reduces overall energy usage, or a combination thereof for energy waste reduction credits otherwise required to meet the energy waste reduction standard, if the substitution is approved by the commission. The commission shall not approve a substitution unless the commission determines that the substitution is cost-effective. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Renewable energy credits, load management that reduces overall energy usage, or a combination thereof shall not be used by a provider to meet more than 10% of the energy waste reduction standard. Substitutions for energy waste reduction credits shall be made at the rate of 1 renewable energy credit per energy waste reduction credit.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>460.1093 Self-directed energy waste reduction plan.</B><P>Sec. 93.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An eligible electric customer is exempt from charges the customer would otherwise incur as an electric customer under sections 72, 89, and 91 if the customer files with its electric provider and implements a self-directed energy waste reduction plan as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to subsection (3), an electric customer is not eligible under subsection (1) unless it is a commercial or industrial electric customer and had an annual peak demand in the preceding year of at least 1 megawatt in the aggregate at all sites to be covered by the self-directed plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The eligibility requirements of subsection (2) do not apply to a commercial or industrial customer that installs or modifies an electric energy efficiency improvement under a property assessed clean energy program pursuant to the property assessed clean energy act, 2010 PA 270, MCL 460.931 to 460.949.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The commission shall by order establish the rates, terms, and conditions of service for customers related to this subpart.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The commission shall by order do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Require a customer to utilize the services of an energy waste reduction service company to develop and implement a self-directed plan. This subdivision does not apply to a customer that had an annual peak demand in the preceding year of at least 2 megawatts at each site to be covered by the self-directed plan or 10 megawatts in the aggregate at all sites to be covered by the self-directed plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Provide a mechanism to recover from customers under subdivision (a) the costs for provider level review and evaluation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Provide a mechanism to cover the costs of the low-income energy waste reduction program under section 89.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) All of the following apply to a self-directed energy waste reduction plan under subsection (1):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The self-directed plan shall be a multiyear plan for an ongoing energy waste reduction program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The self-directed plan shall provide for aggregate energy savings that each year meet or exceed the energy waste reduction standards based on the electricity purchases in the previous year for the site or sites covered by the self-directed plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Under the self-directed plan, energy waste reduction shall be calculated based on annual electricity usage. Annual electricity usage shall be normalized so that none of the following are included in the calculation of the percentage of incremental energy savings:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Changes in electricity usage because of changes in business activity levels not attributable to energy waste reduction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Changes in electricity usage because of the installation, operation, or testing of pollution control equipment. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The self-directed plan shall specify whether electricity usage will be weather-normalized or based on the average number of megawatt hours of electricity sold by the electric provider annually during the previous 3 years to retail customers in this state. Once the self-directed plan is submitted to the provider, this option shall not be changed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The self-directed plan shall outline how the customer intends to achieve the incremental energy savings specified in the self-directed plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A self-directed energy waste reduction plan shall be incorporated into the relevant electric provider's energy waste reduction plan. The self-directed plan and information submitted by the customer under subsection (9) are confidential and exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246. Projected energy savings from measures implemented under a self-directed plan shall be attributed to the relevant provider's energy waste reduction programs for the purposes of determining annual incremental energy savings achieved by the provider under section 77. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Once a customer begins to implement a self-directed plan at a site covered by the self-directed plan, that site is exempt from energy waste reduction program charges under sections 72, 89, and 91 and is not eligible to participate in the relevant electric provider's energy waste reduction programs. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A customer implementing a self-directed energy waste reduction plan under this section shall annually submit to the customer's electric provider a brief report documenting the energy efficiency measures taken under the self-directed plan during the previous year, and the corresponding energy savings that will result. The report shall provide sufficient information for the provider and the commission to monitor progress toward the goals in the self-directed plan and to develop reliable estimates of the energy savings that are being achieved from self-directed plans. The customer report shall indicate the level of incremental energy savings achieved for the year covered by the report and whether that level of incremental energy savings meets the goal set forth in the customer's self-directed plan. If a customer submitting a report under this subsection wishes to amend its self-directed plan, the customer shall submit with the report an amended self-directed plan. A report under this subsection shall be accompanied by an affidavit from a knowledgeable official of the customer that the information in the report is true and correct to the best of the official's knowledge and belief. If the customer has retained an independent energy waste reduction service company, the requirements of this subsection shall be met by the energy waste reduction service company.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) An electric provider shall provide an annual report to the commission that identifies customers implementing self-directed energy waste reduction plans and summarizes the results achieved cumulatively under those self-directed plans. The commission may request additional information from the electric provider. If the commission has sufficient reason to believe the information is inaccurate or incomplete, it may request additional information from the customer to ensure accuracy of the report.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If the commission determines after a contested case hearing that the minimum energy waste reduction goals under subsection (6)(b) have not been achieved at the sites covered by a self-directed plan, in aggregate, the commission shall order the customer or customers collectively to pay to this state an amount calculated as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Determine the proportion of the shortfall in achieving the minimum energy waste reduction goals under subsection (6)(b).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Multiply the figure under subdivision (a) by the energy waste reduction charges from which the customer or customers collectively were exempt under subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Multiply the product under subdivision (b) by a number not less than 1 or greater than 2, as determined by the commission based on the reasons for failure to meet the minimum energy waste reduction goals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If a customer has submitted a self-directed plan to an electric provider, the customer, the customer's energy waste reduction service company, if applicable, or the electric provider shall provide a copy of the self-directed plan to the commission upon request.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) By September 1, 2010, following a public hearing, the commission shall establish an approval process for energy waste reduction service companies. The approval process shall ensure that energy waste reduction service companies have the expertise, resources, and business practices to reliably provide energy waste reduction services that meet the requirements of this section. The commission may adopt by reference the past or current standards of a national or regional certification or licensing program for energy waste reduction service companies. However, the approval process shall also provide an opportunity for energy waste reduction service companies that are not recognized by such a program to be approved by posting a bond in an amount determined by the commission and meeting any other requirements adopted by the commission for the purposes of this subsection. The approval process for energy waste reduction service companies shall require adherence to a code of conduct governing the relationship between energy waste reduction service companies and electric providers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) The department of licensing and regulatory affairs shall maintain on the department's website a list of energy waste reduction service companies approved under subsection (13).</div>

The commission may waive the application, interconnection, and installation requirements of this part for customers participating in the net metering program under the commission's March 29, 2005 order in case no. U-14346.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An electric utility or alternative electric supplier is not required to allow for a distributed generation program that is greater than 10% of its average in-state peak load for the preceding 5 calendar years. The electric utility or alternative electric supplier shall notify the commission if its distributed generation program reaches the 10% limit under this subsection. The 10% limit under this subsection shall be allocated as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Not less than 50% for customers with an eligible electric generator capable of generating 20 kilowatts or less.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Not more than 50% for customers with an eligible electric generator capable of generating more than 20 kilowatts but not more than 550 kilowatts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Selection of customers for participation in the distributed generation program must be based on the order in which the applications for participation in the program are received by the electric utility or alternative electric supplier.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An electric utility or alternative electric supplier shall not discontinue or refuse to provide electric service to a customer solely because the customer participates in the distributed generation program. An electric utility or alternative electric supplier shall not limit the rate schedule under which a customer is served solely because the customer participates in the distributed generation program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The distributed generation program created under subsection (1) must include all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Statewide uniform interconnection requirements for all eligible electric generators. The interconnection requirements must be designed to protect electric utility workers and equipment and the general public.</div>

If necessary to promote grid reliability or safety, the commission may promulgate rules that require the use of inverters that perform specific automated grid-balancing functions to integrate distributed generation onto the electric grid. Inverters that interconnect distributed generation resources may be owned and operated by electric utilities. Both of the following must be completed before the equipment is operated in parallel with the distribution system of the utility: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Utility testing and approval of the interconnection, including all metering.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Execution of a parallel operating agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A uniform application form and process to be used by all electric utilities and alternative electric suppliers in this state. Customers who are served by an alternative electric supplier shall submit a copy of the application to the electric utility for the customer's service area.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Distributed generation customers shall pay the retail rates for electricity inflow under the rate schedule under which the customer is served.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Distributed generation customers shall receive a monthly bill credit for outflow as determined by the commission. Credits for outflow must reflect cost of service. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Each electric utility and alternative electric supplier shall maintain records of all applications and up-to-date records of all active eligible electric generators located within their service area.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) This section applies only to activities of a wireless provider within the public right-of-way for the deployment of small cell wireless facilities and associated new or modified utility poles.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An authority shall not enter into an exclusive arrangement with any person for use of the ROW for the construction, operation, or maintenance of utility poles or the collocation of small cell wireless facilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An authority shall not charge a wireless provider a rate for each utility pole or wireless support structure in the ROW in the authority's geographic jurisdiction on which the wireless provider has colocated a small cell wireless facility that exceeds the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) $20.00 annually, unless subdivision (b) applies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) $125.00 annually, if the utility pole or wireless support structure was erected by or on behalf of the wireless provider on or after the effective date of this act. This subdivision does not apply to the replacement of a utility pole that was not designed to support small cell wireless facilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Every 5 years after the effective date of this act, the maximum rates then authorized under subdivisions (a) and (b) are increased by 10% and rounded to the nearest dollar.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If, on the effective date of this act, an authority has a rate or fee in an ordinance or in an agreement with a wireless provider for the use of the ROW to colocate a small cell wireless facility or to construct, install, mount, maintain, modify, operate, or replace a utility pole, and the rate or fee does not comply with subsection (3), the authority shall, not later than 90 days after the effective date of this act, revise the rate or fee to comply with subsection (3). Both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For installations of utility poles designed to support small cell wireless facilities or collocations of small cell wireless facilities installed and operational in the ROW before the effective date of this act, the fees, rates, and terms of an agreement or ordinance for use of the ROW remain in effect subject to the termination provisions contained in the agreement or ordinance. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For installations of utility poles designed to support small cell wireless facilities or collocations of small cell wireless facilities installed and operational in the ROW after the effective date of this act, the fees, rates, and terms of an agreement or ordinance for use of the ROW shall comply with subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A wireless provider may, as a permitted use not subject to zoning review or approval, except that an application for a permitted use is still subject to approval by the authority under section 15, colocate small cell wireless facilities and construct, maintain, modify, operate, or replace utility poles in, along, across, upon, and under the ROW. Such structures and facilities shall be constructed and maintained so as not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on the ROW or obstruct the legal use of the authority's ROW or uses of the ROW by other utilities and communications service providers. Both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A utility pole in the ROW installed or modified on or after the effective date of this act shall not exceed 40 feet above ground level, unless a taller height is agreed to by the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A small cell wireless facility in the ROW installed or modified after the effective date of this act shall not extend more than 5 feet above a utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small cell wireless facility is colocated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Subject to this section, section 17, and applicable zoning regulations, a wireless provider may colocate a small cell wireless facility or install, construct, maintain, modify, operate, or replace a utility pole that exceeds the height limits under subsection (5), or a wireless support structure, in, along, across, upon, and under the ROW.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A wireless provider shall comply with reasonable and nondiscriminatory requirements otherwise provided that prohibit communications service providers from installing structures on or above ground in the ROW in an area designated solely for underground or buried cable and utility facilities if all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The authority has required all cable and utility facilities, other than authority poles, along with any attachments, or poles used for street lights, traffic signals, or other attachments necessary for public safety, to be placed underground by a date that is not less than 90 days before the submission of the application.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The authority does not prohibit the replacement of authority poles by a wireless provider in the designated area.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The authority allows wireless providers to apply for a waiver of the undergrounding requirements for the placement of a new utility pole to support small cell wireless facilities, and the waiver applications are addressed in a nondiscriminatory manner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Subject to section 15(2), and except for facilities excluded from evaluation for effects on historic properties under 47 CFR 1.1307(a)(4)(ii), an authority may adopt written, objective requirements for reasonable, technically feasible, nondiscriminatory, and technologically neutral design or concealment measures in a historic district, downtown district, or residential zoning district. Any such requirement shall not have the effect of prohibiting any wireless provider's technology. Any such design or concealment measures are not considered a part of the small wireless facility for purposes of the size restrictions in the definition of small wireless facility in section 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An authority's administration and regulation of activities of wireless providers in the ROW shall be reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and competitively neutral and shall comply with applicable law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) An authority may require a wireless provider to repair all damage to the ROW directly caused by the activities of the wireless provider while occupying, constructing, installing, mounting, maintaining, modifying, operating, or replacing small cell wireless facilities, utility poles, or wireless support structures in the ROW and to return the ROW to its functional equivalent before the damage. If the wireless provider fails to make the repairs required by the authority within 60 days after written notice, the authority may make those repairs and charge the wireless provider the reasonable, documented cost of the repairs.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) This section applies to activities of a wireless provider within the public right-of-way.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5), an authority may require a permit to colocate a small cell wireless facility or install, modify, or replace a utility pole on which a small cell wireless facility will be colocated if the permit is of general applicability. The processing of an application for such a permit is subject to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The authority shall not directly or indirectly require an applicant to perform services unrelated to the collocation for which a permit is sought, such as reserving fiber, conduit, or pole space for the authority or making other in-kind contributions to the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An authority may require an applicant to provide information and documentation to enable the authority to make a decision with regard to the criteria in subdivision (i). An authority may also require a certificate of compliance with FCC rules related to radio frequency emissions from a small cell wireless facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the proposed activity will occur within a shared ROW or an ROW that overlaps another ROW, a wireless provider shall provide, to each affected authority to which an application for the activity is not submitted, notification of the wireless provider's intent to locate a small cell wireless facility within the ROW. An authority may require proof of other necessary permits, permit applications, or easements to ensure all necessary permissions for the proposed activity are obtained.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Within 25 days after receiving an application, an authority shall notify the applicant in writing whether the application is complete. If the application is incomplete, the notice shall clearly and specifically delineate all missing documents or information. The notice tolls the running of the time for approving or denying an application under subdivision (h).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The running of time period tolled under subdivision (d) resumes when the applicant makes a supplemental submission in response to the authority's notice of incompleteness. If a supplemental submission is inadequate, the authority shall notify the applicant in writing not later than 10 days after receiving the supplemental submission that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the original notice delineating missing documents or information. The time period may be tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices under the procedures identified in subdivision (d). Second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or information that was not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The authority may require an applicant to include an attestation that the small cell wireless facilities will be operational for use by a wireless services provider within 1 year after the permit issuance date, unless the authority and the applicant agree to extend this period or delay is caused by lack of commercial power or communications transport facilities to the site.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The application shall be processed on a nondiscriminatory basis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The authority shall approve or deny the application and notify the applicant in writing within the following period of time after the application is received:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) Add 15 days if an application from another wireless provider was received within 1 week of the application in question.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) Add 15 days if, before the otherwise applicable 60-day or 75-day time period under this subparagraph elapses, the authority notifies the applicant in writing that an extension is needed and the reasons for the extension.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) For an application for a new or replacement utility pole that meets the height requirements of section 13(5)(a) and associated small cell facility, 90 days, subject to the following adjustments:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) Add 15 days if an application from another wireless provider was received within 1 week of the application in question.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) Add 15 days if, before the otherwise applicable 90-day or 105-day time period under this subparagraph elapses, the authority notifies the applicant in writing that an extension is needed and the reasons for the extension.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>If the authority fails to comply with this subdivision, the completed application is considered to be approved subject to the condition that the applicant provide the authority not less than 7 days' advance written notice that the applicant will be proceeding with the work pursuant to this automatic approval.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) An authority may deny a completed application for a proposed collocation of a small cell wireless facility or installation, modification, or replacement of a utility pole that meets the height requirements in section 13(5)(a) only if the proposed activity would do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Materially interfere with the safe operation of traffic control equipment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Materially interfere with sight lines or clear zones for transportation or pedestrians.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Materially interfere with compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Public Law 101-336, or similar federal, state, or local standards regarding pedestrian access or movement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Materially interfere with maintenance or full unobstructed use of public utility infrastructure under the jurisdiction of an authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) With respect to drainage infrastructure under the jurisdiction of an authority, either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) Materially interfere with maintenance or full unobstructed use of the drainage infrastructure as it was originally designed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) Not be located a reasonable distance from the drainage infrastructure to ensure maintenance under the drain code of 1956, 1956 PA 40, MCL 280.1 to 280.630, and access to the drainage infrastructure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) Fail to comply with reasonable, nondiscriminatory, written spacing requirements of general applicability adopted by ordinance or otherwise that apply to the location of ground-mounted equipment and new utility poles and that do not prevent a wireless provider from serving any location.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vii) Fail to comply with applicable codes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(viii) Fail to comply with section 13(7) or (8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ix) Fail to meet reasonable, objective, written stealth or concealment criteria for small cell wireless facilities applicable in a historic district or other designated area, as specified in an ordinance or otherwise and nondiscriminatorily applied to all other occupants of the ROW, including electric utilities, incumbent or competitive local exchange carriers, fiber providers, cable television operators, and the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) If the completed application is denied, the notice under subdivision (h) shall explain the reasons for the denial and, if applicable, cite the specific provisions of applicable codes on which the denial is based. The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the authority and resubmit the application within 30 days after the denial without paying an additional application fee. The authority shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days. The authority shall limit its review of the revised application to the deficiencies cited in the denial.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) An applicant may at the applicant's discretion file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for the collocation of up to 20 small cell wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of a single authority or, in the case of the state transportation department, a single designated control section as identified on the department's website. The small cell wireless facilities within a consolidated application must consist of substantially similar equipment and be placed on similar types of utility poles or wireless support structures. An authority may approve a permit for 1 or more small cell wireless facilities included in a consolidated application and deny a permit for the remaining small cell facilities. An authority shall not deny a permit for a small cell wireless facility included in a consolidated application on the basis that a permit is being denied for 1 or more other small cell facilities included in that application.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) Within 1 year after a permit is granted, a wireless provider shall complete collocation of a small cell wireless facility that is to be operational for use by a wireless services provider, unless the authority and the applicant agree to extend this period or the delay is caused by the lack of commercial power or communications facilities at the site. If the wireless provider fails to complete the collocation within the applicable time, the permit is void, and the wireless provider may reapply for a permit. A permittee may voluntarily request that a permit be terminated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) Approval of an application authorizes the wireless provider to do both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Undertake the installation or collocation. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Subject to relocation requirements that apply to similarly situated users of the ROW and the applicant's right to terminate at any time, maintain the small cell wireless facilities and any associated utility poles or wireless support structures covered by the permit for so long as the site is in use and in compliance with the initial permit under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) An authority shall not institute a moratorium on filing, receiving, or processing applications or issuing permits for the collocation of small cell wireless facilities or the installation, modification, or replacement of utility poles on which small cell wireless facilities will be colocated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(o) The authority and an applicant may extend a time period under this subsection by mutual agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An application fee for a permit under subsection (2) shall not exceed the lesser of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) $200.00 for each small cell wireless facility alone.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) $300.00 for each small cell wireless facility and a new utility pole to which it will be attached.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Every 5 years after the effective date of this act, the maximum fees then authorized under this subsection are increased by 10% and rounded to the nearest dollar.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An authority may revoke a permit, upon 30 days' notice and an opportunity to cure, if the permitted small cell wireless facilities and any associated utility pole fail to meet the requirements of subsection (2)(i).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An authority shall not require a permit or any other approval or require fees or rates for any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The replacement of a small cell wireless facility with a small cell wireless facility that is not larger or heavier, in compliance with applicable codes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Routine maintenance of a small cell wireless facility, utility pole, or wireless support structure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The installation, placement, maintenance, operation, or replacement of a micro wireless facility that is suspended on cables strung between utility poles or wireless support structures in compliance with applicable codes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An authority that receives an application to place a new utility pole may propose an alternate location within the ROW or on property or structures owned or controlled by an authority within 75 feet of the proposed location to either place the new utility pole or colocate on an existing structure. The applicant shall use the alternate location if, as determined by the applicant, the applicant has the right to do so on reasonable terms and conditions and the alternate location does not impose unreasonable technical limits or significant additional costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Before discontinuing its use of a small cell wireless facility, utility pole, or wireless support structure, a wireless provider shall notify an authority in writing. The notice shall specify when and how the wireless provider intends to remove the small cell wireless facility, utility pole, or wireless support structure. The authority may impose reasonable and nondiscriminatory requirements and specifications for the wireless provider to return the property to its preinstallation condition. If the wireless provider does not complete the removal within 45 days after the discontinuance of use, the authority may complete the removal and assess the costs of removal against the wireless provider. A permit under this section for a small cell wireless facility expires upon removal of the small cell wireless facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) This section does not prohibit an authority from requiring a permit for work that will unreasonably affect traffic patterns or obstruct vehicular or pedestrian traffic in the ROW.</div>

If such a process has not been adopted within 90 days after the effective date of this act, the application process in section 15 applies to such requests. The governing body of a municipally owned electric utility shall not impose a moratorium on the processing of nonauthority pole collocation requests, or require a wireless provider to perform any service not directly related to the collocation. The governing body of a municipally owned electric utility may charge a fee not to exceed $100.00 per nonauthority pole for processing the request. The governing body of a municipally owned electric utility may charge an additional fee not to exceed $100.00 per nonauthority pole for processing the request, if a modification or maintenance of the collocation requires an engineering analysis. Every 5 years after the effective date of this act, the maximum fees then authorized under this subsection are increased by 10% and rounded to the nearest dollar.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The rate for a wireless provider to colocate on a nonauthority pole in the ROW shall not exceed $50.00 annually per nonauthority pole. Every 5 years after the effective date of this act, the maximum rate then authorized under this subsection is increased by 10% and rounded to the nearest dollar.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A wireless provider shall comply with the process for make-ready work that the governing body of a municipally owned electric utility has adopted for other parties under the same or similar circumstances that attach facilities to nonauthority poles. If such a process has not been adopted, the wireless provider and the governing body of a municipally owned electric utility shall comply with the process for make-ready work under 47 USC 224 and implementing orders and regulations. A good-faith estimate established by the governing body of a municipally owned electric utility for any make-ready work for nonauthority poles shall include pole replacement if necessary. All make-ready costs shall be based on actual costs, with detailed documentation provided.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a wireless provider is required to relocate small cell wireless facilities colocated on a nonauthority pole, it shall do so in accordance with the nondiscriminatory terms adopted by the governing body of a municipally owned electric utility.</div>
