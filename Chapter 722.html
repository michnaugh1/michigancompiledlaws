<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The parents are jointly and severally obligated to support a minor as prescribed in section 5 of the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.605, unless a court of competent jurisdiction modifies or terminates the obligation or the minor is emancipated by operation of law, except as otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to section 5b of the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.605b, a court of competent jurisdiction may order support as provided in this section for a child after he or she reaches 18 years of age.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The duty of support may be enforced by the minor or the child who has reached 18 years of age, his or her guardian, any relative within the third degree, an authorized government agency, or if the minor or the child who has reached 18 years of age is being supported in whole or in part by public assistance under the social welfare act, 1939 PA 280, MCL 400.1 to 400.119b, by the director of the department of human services or his or her designated representative, or by the director of the county department of human services or his or her designated representative of the county where an action under this act is brought. An action for enforcement shall be brought in the circuit court in the county where the minor or the child who has reached 18 years of age resides. If a designated official of either the state or a county department of human services brings an action under this act on behalf of the minor or the child who has reached 18 years of age, the prosecuting attorney shall represent the official in initiating and conducting the proceedings under this act. The child support formula developed under section 19 of the friend of the court act, 1982 PA 294, MCL 552.519, shall be used as a guideline in petitioning for child support.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The prosecuting attorney and the department of human services may enter into an agreement to transfer the prosecutor's responsibilities under this act to 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The friend of the court, with the approval of the chief judge of the circuit court.</div>

If this act contains a specific provision regarding the contents or enforcement of a support order that conflicts with a provision in the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.601 to 552.650, this act controls in regard to that provision.</div>

<P>Sec. 4.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In all actions involving dispute of a minor child's custody, the court shall declare the child's inherent rights and establish the rights and duties as to the child's custody, support, and parenting time in accordance with this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If, at any time in the proceeding, the court determines that the child's best interests are inadequately represented, the court may appoint a lawyer-guardian ad litem to represent the child. A lawyer-guardian ad litem represents the child and has powers and duties in relation to that representation as set forth in section 17d of chapter XIIA of 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.17d. All provisions of section 17d of chapter XIIA of 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.17d, apply to a lawyer-guardian ad litem appointed under this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In a proceeding in which a lawyer-guardian ad litem represents a child, he or she may file a written report and recommendation. The court may read the report and recommendation. The court shall not, however, admit the report and recommendation into evidence unless all parties stipulate the admission. The parties may make use of the report and recommendation for purposes of a settlement conference.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   After a determination of ability to pay, the court may assess all or part of the costs and reasonable fees of the lawyer-guardian ad litem against 1 or more of the parties involved in the proceedings or against the money allocated from marriage license fees for family counseling services under section 3 of 1887 PA 128, MCL 551.103. A lawyer-guardian ad litem appointed under this section shall not be paid a fee unless the court first receives and approves the fee.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a child custody dispute is between the parents, between agencies, or between third persons, the best interests of the child control. If the child custody dispute is between the parent or parents and an agency or a third person, the court shall presume that the best interests of the child are served by awarding custody to the parent or parents, unless the contrary is established by clear and convincing evidence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Notwithstanding other provisions of this act, if a child custody dispute involves a child who is conceived as the result of acts for which 1 of the child's biological parents is convicted of criminal sexual conduct as provided in sections 520a to 520e and 520g of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.520a to 750.520e and 750.520g, or a substantially similar statute of another state or the federal government, or is found by clear and convincing evidence in a fact-finding hearing to have committed acts of nonconsensual sexual penetration, the court shall not award custody to that biological parent. This subsection does not apply to a conviction under section 520d(1)(a) of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.520d. This subsection does not apply if, after the date of the conviction, or the date of the finding in a fact-finding hearing described in this subsection, the biological parents cohabit and establish a mutual custodial environment for the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An offending parent is not entitled to custody of a child described in subsection (2) without the consent of that child's other parent or guardian.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Notwithstanding other provisions of this act, subsection (2) does not relieve an offending parent of any support or maintenance obligation to the child. The other parent or the guardian of the child may decline support or maintenance from the offending parent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A parent may assert an affirmative defense of the provisions of subsection (2) in a proceeding brought by the offending parent regarding a child described in subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Notwithstanding other provisions of this act, if an individual is convicted of criminal sexual conduct as provided in sections 520a to 520e and 520g of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.520a to 750.520e and 750.520g, and the victim is the individual's child, the court shall not award custody of that child or a sibling of that child to that individual, unless both the child's other parent and, if the court considers the child or sibling to be of sufficient age to express his or her desires, the child or sibling consent to the custody.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) As used in this section, "offending parent" means a parent who has been convicted of criminal sexual conduct as described in subsection (2) or who has been found by clear and convincing evidence in a fact-finding hearing to have committed acts of nonconsensual sexual penetration as described in subsection (2).</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 6a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    In custody disputes between parents, the parents shall be advised of joint custody. At the request of either parent, the court shall consider an award of joint custody, and shall state on the record the reasons for granting or denying a request. In other cases joint custody may be considered by the court. The court shall determine whether joint custody is in the best interest of the child by considering the following factors:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The factors enumerated in section 3.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Whether the parents will be able to cooperate and generally agree concerning important decisions affecting the welfare of the child.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the parents agree on joint custody, the court shall award joint custody unless the court determines on the record, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that joint custody is not in the best interests of the child.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the court awards joint custody, the court may include in its award a statement regarding when the child shall reside with each parent, or may provide that physical custody be shared by the parents in a manner to assure the child continuing contact with both parents.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   During the time a child resides with a parent, that parent shall decide all routine matters concerning the child.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If there is a dispute regarding residency, the court shall state the basis for a residency award on the record or in writing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Joint custody shall not eliminate the responsibility for child support. Each parent shall be responsible for child support based on the needs of the child and the actual resources of each parent. If a parent would otherwise be unable to maintain adequate housing for the child and the other parent has sufficient resources, the court may order modified support payments for a portion of housing expenses even during a period when the child is not residing in the home of the parent receiving support. An order of joint custody, in and of itself, shall not constitute grounds for modifying a support order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   As used in this section, "joint custody" means an order of the court in which 1 or both of the following is specified:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That the child shall reside alternately for specific periods with each of the parents. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   That the parents shall share decision-making authority as to the important decisions affecting the welfare of the child.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 6b.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2), a guardian or limited guardian of a child has standing to bring an action for custody of the child as provided in this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A limited guardian of a child does not have standing to bring an action for custody of the child if the parent or parents of the child have substantially complied with a limited guardianship placement plan regarding the child entered into as required by section 5205 of the estates and protected individuals code, 1998 PA 386, MCL 700.5205, or section 424a of former 1978 PA 642.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a child custody dispute has been submitted to the circuit court as an original action under this act or has arisen incidentally from another action in the circuit court or an order or judgment of the circuit court, for the best interests of the child the court may do 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Award the custody of the child to 1 or more of the parties involved or to others and provide for payment of support for the child, until the child reaches 18 years of age. Subject to section 5b of the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.605b, the court may also order support as provided in this section for a child after he or she reaches 18 years of age. The court may require that support payments shall be made through the friend of the court, court clerk, or state disbursement unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Provide for reasonable parenting time of the child by the parties involved, by the maternal or paternal grandparents, or by others, by general or specific terms and conditions. Parenting time of the child by the parents is governed by section 7a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Subject to subsection (3), modify or amend its previous judgments or orders for proper cause shown or because of change of circumstances until the child reaches 18 years of age and, subject to section 5b of the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.605b, until the child reaches 19 years and 6 months of age. The court shall not modify or amend its previous judgments or orders or issue a new order so as to change the established custodial environment of a child unless there is presented clear and convincing evidence that it is in the best interest of the child. The custodial environment of a child is established if over an appreciable time the child naturally looks to the custodian in that environment for guidance, discipline, the necessities of life, and parental comfort. The age of the child, the physical environment, and the inclination of the custodian and the child as to permanency of the relationship shall also be considered. If a motion for change of custody is filed while a parent is active duty, the court shall not consider a parent's absence due to that active duty status in a best interest of the child determination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Utilize a guardian ad litem or the community resources in behavioral sciences and other professions in the investigation and study of custody disputes and consider their recommendations for the resolution of the disputes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Take any other action considered to be necessary in a particular child custody dispute.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Upon petition consider the reasonable grandparenting time of maternal or paternal grandparents as provided in section 7b and, if denied, make a record of the denial.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A judgment or order entered under this act providing for the support of a child is governed by and is enforceable as provided in the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.601 to 552.650. If this act contains a specific provision regarding the contents or enforcement of a support order that conflicts with a provision in the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.601 to 552.650, this act controls in regard to that provision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) As provided in the servicemembers civil relief act, 50 USC 501 to 597b, if a motion for change of custody is filed during the time a parent is on deployment, a parent may file and the court shall entertain an application for stay. The court shall not enter an order modifying or amending a previous judgment or order, or issue a new order, that changes the child's placement that existed on the date the parent was called to deployment, except that the court may enter a temporary custody order if there is clear and convincing evidence that it is in the best interests of the child. When a temporary custody order is issued under this subsection, the court may include a limit on the period of time that the temporary custody order remains in effect. At any stage before final judgment in the proceeding, the parent may file an application for stay or otherwise request a stay of the proceedings or file an application for an extension of a stay. The parent and the custodial child are not required to be present to consider the application for stay or extension of a stay. The application for stay or extension of a stay is sufficient if it is a signed, written statement, certified to be true under penalty of perjury. The same conditions for the initial stay apply to an application for an extension of a stay. The parent's duration of deployment shall not be considered in making a best interest of the child determination. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The parent shall inform the court of the deployment end date before or within 30 days after that deployment end date. Upon notification of a parent's deployment end date, the court shall reinstate the custody order in effect immediately preceding that period of deployment. If a motion for change of custody is filed after a parent returns from deployment, the court shall not consider a parent's absence due to that deployment in making a best interest of the child determination. Future deployments shall not be considered in making a best interest of the child determination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the deploying parent and the other parent share custody, the deploying parent must notify the other parent of an upcoming deployment within a reasonable period of time.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Parenting time shall be granted in accordance with the best interests of the child. It is presumed to be in the best interests of a child for the child to have a strong relationship with both of his or her parents. Except as otherwise provided in this section, parenting time shall be granted to a parent in a frequency, duration, and type reasonably calculated to promote a strong relationship between the child and the parent granted parenting time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the parents of a child agree on parenting time terms, the court shall order the parenting time terms unless the court determines on the record by clear and convincing evidence that the parenting time terms are not in the best interests of the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A child has a right to parenting time with a parent unless it is shown on the record by clear and convincing evidence that it would endanger the child's physical, mental, or emotional health.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Notwithstanding other provisions of this act, if a proceeding regarding parenting time involves a child who is conceived as the result of acts for which 1 of the child's biological parents is convicted of criminal sexual conduct as provided in sections 520a to 520e and 520g of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.520a to 750.520e and 750.520g, or a substantially similar statute of another state or the federal government, or is found by clear and convincing evidence in a fact-finding hearing to have committed acts of nonconsensual sexual penetration, the court shall not grant parenting time to that biological parent. This subsection does not apply to a conviction under section 520d(1)(a) of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.520d. This subsection does not apply if, after the date of the conviction, or the date of the finding in a fact-finding hearing described in this subsection, the biological parents cohabit and establish a mutual custodial environment for the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A parent may assert an affirmative defense of the provisions of subsection (4) in a proceeding brought by the offending parent regarding a child described in subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Notwithstanding other provisions of this act, if an individual is convicted of criminal sexual conduct as provided in sections 520a to 520e and 520g of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.520a to 750.520e and 750.520g, and the victim is the individual's child, the court shall not grant parenting time with that child or a sibling of that child to that individual, unless both the child's other parent and, if the court considers the child or sibling to be of sufficient age to express his or her desires, the child or sibling consent to the parenting time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The court may consider the following factors when determining the frequency, duration, and type of parenting time to be granted:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The existence of any special circumstances or needs of the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Whether the child is a nursing child less than 6 months of age, or less than 1 year of age if the child receives substantial nutrition through nursing. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The reasonable likelihood of abuse or neglect of the child during parenting time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The reasonable likelihood of abuse of a parent resulting from the exercise of parenting time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The inconvenience to, and burdensome impact or effect on, the child of traveling for purposes of parenting time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Whether a parent can reasonably be expected to exercise parenting time in accordance with the court order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Whether a parent has frequently failed to exercise reasonable parenting time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The threatened or actual detention of the child with the intent to retain or conceal the child from the other parent or from a third person who has legal custody. A custodial parent's temporary residence with the child in a domestic violence shelter shall not be construed as evidence of the custodial parent's intent to retain or conceal the child from the other parent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Any other relevant factors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Parenting time shall be granted in specific terms if requested by either party at any time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A parenting time order may contain any reasonable terms or conditions that facilitate the orderly and meaningful exercise of parenting time by a parent, including 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Division of the responsibility to transport the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Division of the cost of transporting the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Restrictions on the presence of third persons during parenting time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Requirements that the child be ready for parenting time at a specific time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Requirements that the parent arrive for parenting time and return the child from parenting time at specific times.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Requirements that parenting time occur in the presence of a third person or agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Requirements that a party post a bond to assure compliance with a parenting time order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Requirements of reasonable notice when parenting time will not occur.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Any other reasonable condition determined to be appropriate in the particular case.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Except as provided in this subsection, a parenting time order shall contain a prohibition on exercising parenting time in a country that is not a party to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. This subsection does not apply if both parents provide the court with written consent to allow a parent to exercise parenting time in a country that is not a party to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) During the time a child is with a parent to whom parenting time has been awarded, that parent shall decide all routine matters concerning the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Prior to entry of a temporary order, a parent may seek an ex parte interim order concerning parenting time. If the court enters an ex parte interim order concerning parenting time, the party on whose motion the ex parte interim order is entered shall have a true copy of the order served on the friend of the court and the opposing party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) If the opposing party objects to the ex parte interim order, he or she shall file with the clerk of the court within 14 days after receiving notice of the order a written objection to, or a motion to modify or rescind, the ex parte interim order. The opposing party shall have a true copy of the written objection or motion served on the friend of the court and the party who obtained the ex parte interim order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) If the opposing party files a written objection to the ex parte interim order, the friend of the court shall attempt to resolve the dispute within 14 days after receiving it. If the matter cannot be resolved, the friend of the court shall provide the opposing party with a form motion and order with written instructions for their use in modifying or rescinding the ex parte order without assistance of counsel. If the opposing party wishes to proceed without assistance of counsel, the friend of the court shall schedule a hearing with the court that shall be held within 21 days after the filing of the motion. If the opposing party files a motion to modify or rescind the ex parte interim order and requests a hearing, the court shall resolve the dispute within 28 days after the hearing is requested.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) An ex parte interim order issued under this section shall contain the following notice:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>NOTICE:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>1. You may file a written objection to this order or a motion to modify or rescind this order. You must file the written objection or motion with the clerk of the court within 14 days after you were served with this order. You must serve a true copy of the objection or motion on the friend of the court and the party who obtained the order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>2. If you file a written objection, the friend of the court must try to resolve the dispute. If the friend of the court cannot resolve the dispute and if you wish to bring the matter before the court without the assistance of counsel, the friend of the court must provide you with form pleadings and written instructions and must schedule a hearing with the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) As provided in the servicemembers civil relief act, 50 USC 501 to 597b, if a motion for change of parenting time is filed during the time a parent is on deployment, a parent may file and the court shall entertain an application for stay. The court shall presume that the best interests of the child are served by not entering an order modifying or amending a previous judgment or order, or issuing a new order, that changes the parenting time that existed on the date the parent was called to deployment, unless the contrary is established by clear and convincing evidence, at which time the court may enter a temporary parenting time order. When a temporary parenting time order is issued under this subsection, the court may include a limit on the period of time that the temporary parenting time order remains in effect. At any stage before final judgment in the proceeding, the parent may file an application for stay or otherwise request a stay of proceedings or file an application for an extension of a stay. The parent and the custodial child are not required to be present to consider the application for stay or extension of a stay. The application for stay or extension of a stay is sufficient if it is a signed, written statement, certified to be true under penalty of perjury. The same conditions for the initial stay apply to applications for an extension of a stay.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) The parent shall inform the court of the deployment end date before or within 30 days after that deployment end date. Upon notification of a parent's deployment end date, the court shall reinstate the parenting time order in effect immediately preceding that period of deployment. If a motion for change of parenting time is filed after a parent returns from deployment, the court shall not consider a parent's absence due to that deployment in making a determination regarding change of parenting time. Future deployments shall not be considered in making a best interest of the child determination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) If the deploying parent and the other parent share custody, the deploying parent must notify the other parent of an upcoming deployment within a reasonable period of time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) As used in this section, "offending parent" means a parent who has been convicted of criminal sexual conduct as described in subsection (4) or who has been found by clear and convincing evidence in a fact-finding hearing to have committed acts of nonconsensual sexual penetration as described in subsection (4).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A child's grandparent may seek a grandparenting time order under 1 or more of the following circumstances: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An action for divorce, separate maintenance, or annulment involving the child's parents is pending before the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The child's parents are divorced, separated under a judgment of separate maintenance, or have had their marriage annulled.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The child's parent who is a child of the grandparents is deceased.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The child's parents have never been married, they are not residing in the same household, and paternity has been established by the completion of an acknowledgment of parentage under the acknowledgment of parentage act, 1996 PA 305, MCL 722.1001 to 722.1013, by an order of filiation entered under the paternity act, 1956 PA 205, MCL 722.711 to 722.730, or by a determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that the individual is the father of the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (13), legal custody of the child has been given to a person other than the child's parent, or the child is placed outside of and does not reside in the home of a parent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) In the year preceding the commencement of an action under subsection (3) for grandparenting time, the grandparent provided an established custodial environment for the child as described in section 7, whether or not the grandparent had custody under a court order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A court shall not permit a parent of a father who has never been married to the child's mother to seek an order for grandparenting time under this section unless the father has completed an acknowledgment of parentage under the acknowledgment of parentage act, 1996 PA 305, MCL 722.1001 to 722.1013, an order of filiation has been entered under the paternity act, 1956 PA 205, MCL 722.711 to 722.730, or the father has been determined to be the father by a court of competent jurisdiction. The court shall not permit the parent of a putative father to seek an order for grandparenting time unless the putative father has provided substantial and regular support or care in accordance with the putative father's ability to provide the support or care. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A grandparent seeking a grandparenting time order shall commence an action for grandparenting time, as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the circuit court has continuing jurisdiction over the child, the child's grandparent shall seek a grandparenting time order by filing a motion with the circuit court in the county where the court has continuing jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the circuit court does not have continuing jurisdiction over the child, the child's grandparent shall seek a grandparenting time order by filing a complaint in the circuit court for the county where the child resides. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) All of the following apply to an action for grandparenting time under subsection (3):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The complaint or motion for grandparenting time filed under subsection (3) shall be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth facts supporting the requested order. The grandparent shall give notice of the filing to each person who has legal custody of, or an order for parenting time with, the child. A party having legal custody may file an opposing affidavit. A hearing shall be held by the court on its own motion or if a party requests a hearing. At the hearing, parties submitting affidavits shall be allowed an opportunity to be heard. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) In order to give deference to the decisions of fit parents, it is presumed in a proceeding under this subsection that a fit parent's decision to deny grandparenting time does not create a substantial risk of harm to the child's mental, physical, or emotional health. To rebut the presumption created in this subdivision, a grandparent filing a complaint or motion under this section must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the parent's decision to deny grandparenting time creates a substantial risk of harm to the child's mental, physical, or emotional health. If the grandparent does not overcome the presumption, the court shall dismiss the complaint or deny the motion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If a court of appellate jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the burden of proof described in subdivision (b) is unconstitutional, a grandparent filing a complaint or motion under this section must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the parent's decision to deny grandparenting time creates a substantial risk of harm to the child's mental, physical, or emotional health to rebut the presumption created in subdivision (b).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If 2 fit parents sign an affidavit stating that they both oppose an order for grandparenting time, the court shall dismiss a complaint or motion seeking an order for grandparenting time filed under subsection (3). This subsection does not apply if 1 of the fit parents is a stepparent who adopted a child under the Michigan adoption code, chapter X of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 710.21 to 710.70, and the grandparent seeking the order is the natural or adoptive parent of a parent of the child who is deceased or whose parental rights have been terminated. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the court finds that a grandparent has met the standard for rebutting the presumption described in subsection (4), the court shall consider whether it is in the best interests of the child to enter an order for grandparenting time. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that it is in the best interests of the child to enter a grandparenting time order, the court shall enter an order providing for reasonable grandparenting time of the child by the grandparent by general or specific terms and conditions. In determining the best interests of the child under this subsection, the court shall consider all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The love, affection, and other emotional ties existing between the grandparent and the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The length and quality of the prior relationship between the child and the grandparent, the role performed by the grandparent, and the existing emotional ties of the child to the grandparent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The grandparent's moral fitness.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The grandparent's mental and physical health.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The child's reasonable preference, if the court considers the child to be of sufficient age to express a preference.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The effect on the child of hostility between the grandparent and the parent of the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The willingness of the grandparent, except in the case of abuse or neglect, to encourage a close relationship between the child and the parent or parents of the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Any history of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse or neglect of any child by the grandparent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Whether the parent's decision to deny, or lack of an offer of, grandparenting time is related to the child's well-being or is for some other unrelated reason.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Any other factor relevant to the physical and psychological well-being of the child. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the court has determined that a grandparent has met the standard for rebutting the presumption described in subsection (4), the court may refer that grandparent's complaint or motion for grandparenting time filed under subsection (3) to alternative dispute resolution as provided by supreme court rule. If the complaint or motion is referred to the friend of the court for alternative dispute resolution and no settlement is reached through friend of the court alternative dispute resolution within a reasonable time after the date of referral, the complaint or motion shall be heard by the court as provided in this section. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A grandparent may not file more than once every 2 years, absent a showing of good cause, a complaint or motion under subsection (3) seeking a grandparenting time order. If the court finds there is good cause to allow a grandparent to file more than 1 complaint or motion under this section in a 2-year period, the court shall allow the filing and shall consider the complaint or motion. Upon motion of a person, the court may order reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The court shall not enter an order prohibiting an individual who has legal custody of a child from changing the domicile of the child if the prohibition is primarily for the purpose of allowing a grandparent to exercise the rights conferred in a grandparenting time order entered under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A grandparenting time order entered under this section does not create parental rights in the individual or individuals to whom grandparenting time rights are granted. The entry of a grandparenting time order does not prevent a court of competent jurisdiction from acting upon the custody of the child, the parental rights of the child, or the adoption of the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A court shall not modify or terminate a grandparenting time order entered under this section unless it finds by a preponderance of the evidence, on the basis of facts that have arisen since entry of the grandparenting time order or were unknown to the court at the time it entered that order, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child or his or her custodian and that a modification or termination of the existing order is necessary to avoid creating a substantial risk of harm to the mental, physical, or emotional health of the child. A court modifying or terminating a grandparenting time order under this subsection shall include specific findings of fact in its order in support of its decision. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A court shall make a record of its analysis and findings under subsections (4), (6), (8), and (11), including the reasons for granting or denying a requested grandparenting time order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, adoption of a child or placement of a child for adoption under the Michigan adoption code, chapter X of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 710.21 to 710.70, terminates the right of a grandparent to commence an action for grandparenting time with that child. Adoption of a child by a stepparent under the Michigan adoption code, chapter X of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 710.21 to 710.70, does not terminate the right of the parent of a deceased parent of the child to commence an action for grandparenting time with that child.</div>

Jan. 8, 2010 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> The Michigan Court of Appeals in DeRose v DeRose, 249 Mich App 388; 643 NW2d 259 (2002) held that section 7b of the child custody act of 1970, 1970 PA 91, MCL 722.27b, is unconstitutional. The Michigan Supreme Court affirmed. [DeRose v DeRose, 496 Mich 320; 666 NW2d 636 (2003)] The Michigan Supreme Court held that it was bound by the decision in US Supreme Court in Troxel v Granville, 530 US 57; 120 S Ct 2054; 147 L Ed 2d 49 (2000). The US Supreme Court established in that decision that parents have a fundamental right to raise their children, and on that basis, “the parents have the right to make decisions for children, and such decisions must be accorded deference or weight.” The Michigan Supreme Court held that MCL 722.27b failed to “require that a trial court accord deference to the decisions of fit parents regarding grandparent visitation” and is therefore constitutionally invalid.</p>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A parenting coordinator is a person appointed by the court for a specified term to help implement the parenting time orders of the court and to help resolve parenting disputes that fall within the scope of the parenting coordinator's appointment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The court may enter an order appointing a parenting coordinator if the parties and the parenting coordinator agree to the appointment and its scope. Before appointing a parenting coordinator, the court shall consider any history of a coercive or violent relationship between the parties. The court shall ensure that the order appointing the parenting coordinator provides adequate protection to the victim of a coercive or violent relationship.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The order appointing a parenting coordinator shall include all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An acknowledgment that each party has had the opportunity to consult with an attorney and a domestic violence counselor.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The dispute resolution process that will be used by the parenting coordinator, explaining how the parenting coordinator will make recommendations on issues and the effect to be given to those recommendations. The process must ensure that both parties have an opportunity to be heard on issues under consideration by the parenting coordinator and an opportunity to respond to relevant allegations against them before a recommendation is made. The parties may agree that on specific types of issues they must follow a parenting coordinator's recommendations until modified by the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The court may terminate the appointment of the parenting coordinator if the court finds that the appointment is no longer helpful to the court in resolving parenting disputes or if the process is no longer safe for a party or a child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The parenting coordinator may resign at any time, with notice to the parties and to the court.

A reasonable inquiry includes the use of the domestic violence screening protocol for mediation provided by the state court administrative office.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the parenting coordinator determines that there is a history of a coercive or violent relationship between the parties, the parenting coordinator shall not bring the parties within proximity of each other unless the party at risk from violence or coercion requests it and the parenting coordinator determines with that party what reasonable steps, if any, can be taken to address concerns regarding coercion or violence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The parenting coordinator is not required to disclose information if disclosure will compromise the safety of a party or a child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The parenting coordinator shall make his or her recommendations in writing and provide copies of the recommendation to the parties in the manner specified in the parenting coordination order. If a party attaches the recommendation to a motion or other filing, the court may read and consider the recommendation, but the recommendation is not evidence unless the parties stipulate that it is.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The parenting coordinator shall not recommend relief that is less protective than any other order related to the parties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Subject to the Michigan rules of evidence, the court may allow the testimony of the parenting coordinator if the court finds the testimony useful to the resolution of a pending dispute. The parenting coordinator shall not testify regarding statements received from a child involved in the parenting coordination if the parenting coordinator believes the disclosure would be damaging to the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) A parenting coordinator who has reasonable cause to suspect child abuse or neglect shall immediately make oral and written reports, or cause oral and written reports to be made, to the department of human services as provided in section 3 of the child protection law, 1975 PA 238, MCL 722.623.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 11.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A child whose parental custody is governed by court order has, for the purposes of this section, a legal residence with each parent. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a parent of a child whose custody is governed by court order shall not change a legal residence of the child to a location that is more than 100 miles from the child's legal residence at the time of the commencement of the action in which the order is issued.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A parent's change of a child's legal residence is not restricted by subsection (1) if the other parent consents to, or if the court, after complying with subsection (4), permits, the residence change. This section does not apply if the order governing the child's custody grants sole legal custody to 1 of the child's parents.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   This section does not apply if, at the time of the commencement of the action in which the custody order is issued, the child's 2 residences were more than 100 miles apart. This section does not apply if the legal residence change results in the child's 2 legal residences being closer to each other than before the change.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Before permitting a legal residence change otherwise restricted by subsection (1), the court shall consider each of the following factors, with the child as the primary focus in the court's deliberations:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Whether the legal residence change has the capacity to improve the quality of life for both the child and the relocating parent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The degree to which each parent has complied with, and utilized his or her time under, a court order governing parenting time with the child, and whether the parent's plan to change the child's legal residence is inspired by that parent's desire to defeat or frustrate the parenting time schedule.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The degree to which the court is satisfied that, if the court permits the legal residence change, it is possible to order a modification of the parenting time schedule and other arrangements governing the child's schedule in a manner that can provide an adequate basis for preserving and fostering the parental relationship between the child and each parent; and whether each parent is likely to comply with the modification.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The extent to which the parent opposing the legal residence change is motivated by a desire to secure a financial advantage with respect to a support obligation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Domestic violence, regardless of whether the violence was directed against or witnessed by the child.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Each order determining or modifying custody or parenting time of a child shall include a provision stating the parent's agreement as to how a change in either of the child's legal residences will be handled. If such a provision is included in the order and a child's legal residence change is done in compliance with that provision, this section does not apply. If the parents do not agree on such a provision, the court shall include in the order the following provision: "A parent whose custody or parenting time of a child is governed by this order shall not change the legal residence of the child except in compliance with section 11 of the "Child Custody Act of 1970", 1970 PA 91, MCL 722.31.".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If this section applies to a change of a child's legal residence and the parent seeking to change that legal residence needs to seek a safe location from the threat of domestic violence, the parent may move to such a location with the child until the court makes a determination under this section.</DIV>

Before issuing or renewing a child care center, group child care home, or family child care home license, the department must investigate the applicant's activities and proposed standards of care and must make an on-site visit of the proposed or established child care center, group child care home, or family child care home. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and sections 5q and 5r, if the department is satisfied as to the need for a child care center, group child care home, or family child care home, as to its financial stability, and that the service, facility, applicant, licensee, child care staff member, or member of the household is conducive to the welfare of the children, the department shall issue or renew the child care center, group child care home, or family child care home license. If the department determines that a service, facility, applicant, licensee, child care staff member, or member of the household is not conducive to the welfare of the children, the department shall deny that application or revoke that licensee's license according to section 11.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An applicant for a child care center license must disclose the ownership interest in the child care center as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the owner is a trust, the applicant must disclose the names and addresses of all the trustees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the owner is a privately held corporation, the applicant must disclose the names and addresses of all shareholders, officers, and directors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the owner is a publicly held corporation, the applicant must disclose the names and addresses of the officers and directors and all shareholders holding a direct or indirect interest of greater than 5%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If the owner is a partnership or limited liability partnership, the applicant must disclose the names and addresses of all the partners.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the owner is a limited partnership or limited liability limited partnership, the applicant must disclose the names and addresses of all partners, both general and limited.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) If the owner is a limited liability company, the applicant must disclose the names and addresses of all members and managers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) If the owner is a legal entity not covered under subdivisions (a) to (f), the applicant must disclose the names and address of all individuals that participate in governance for the legal entity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) To assess whether the service, facility, applicant, licensee, child care staff member, or member of the household is conducive to the welfare of the children, the department may utilize available information, including, but not limited to, any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Investigative report, such as a law enforcement report and a children's protective services report.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Medical report.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Public record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Child care center, group child care home, or family child care home record.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The department shall issue a group child care home or family child care home license to a person who has successfully completed an orientation session offered by the department and who meets the requirements of this act. The department must make available to group child care home or family child care home applicants for licensure an orientation session regarding this act, the rules promulgated under this act, and the needs of children in child care before issuing a group child care home or family child care home license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Except as provided in subsection (2), the department shall issue an original or renewal license under this act for a child care center, group child care home, or family child care home not later than 6 months after the applicant files a completed application. Receipt of the application is considered the date the application is received by the department. If the application is considered incomplete by the department, the department must notify the applicant in writing or make notice electronically available within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting additional information. If the department identifies a deficiency or requires the fulfillment of a corrective action plan, the 6-month period is tolled until either of the following occurs:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Upon notification by the department of a deficiency, until the date the requested information is received by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Upon notification by the department that a corrective action plan is required, until the date the department determines the requirements of the corrective action plan have been met.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The determination of the completeness of an application is not an approval of the application for the license and does not confer eligibility on an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Except as provided in subsection (2), if the department fails to issue, deny, or refuse to renew a license to a child care center, group child care home, or family child care home within the time required by this section, the department must return the application fee required under subsection (11) and shall reduce the application fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. Failure to issue, deny, or refuse to renew a license to a child care center, group child care home, or family child care home within the time period required under this section does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of the application. A completed application shall be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in processing of an application based on the fact that the application fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If, on a continual basis, inspections performed by a local health department delay the department in issuing or denying a license for a child care center, group child care home, or family child care home under this act within the 6-month period, the department may use department staff to complete the inspection instead of the local health department causing the delays.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The department shall assess fees as provided in the following schedule:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Family child care home license, $50.00 for an original license application and $25.00 for renewal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Group child care home license, $100.00 for an original license application and $50.00 for renewal.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Child care center license with a capacity of 51 to 100, $250.00 for an original license application and $125.00 for renewal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Child care center license with a capacity of over 100, $300.00 for an original license application and $150.00 for renewal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The department shall use the fees collected under this section only to fund the program licensing child care centers, group child care homes, and family child care homes. Funds remaining at the end of the fiscal year shall not lapse to the general fund but shall remain available to fund the program in subsequent years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Fees described in this section are payable to the department at the time an application is submitted for original issuance or renewal. If a license is denied, revoked, or refused renewal, or an application is rejected as provided in section 15(4), the department shall not refund fees paid to the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Completed application" means an application complete on its face and submitted with any applicable fees as well as any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, a state department or agency of another state, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of this state. A completed application does not include a health inspection performed by a local health department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Conducive to the welfare of the children" means:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The service and facility comply with this act and the administrative rules promulgated under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The disposition, temperament, condition, and action of the applicant, licensee, licensee designee, program director, child care staff member, and member of the household promote the safety and well-being of the children served.</div>

If an individual has been determined to be ineligible based upon a conviction that has been expunged or set aside or a central registry case that has been expunged, the individual shall provide the supporting court, law enforcement, or department of health and human services, or equivalent department from another state, documents along with the request for redetermination. The individual shall not be determined to be ineligible based upon a conviction that has been set aside or expunged or a central registry case that has been expunged. The department shall review the request and issue a written decision within 30 business days after receiving the request for redetermination. The decision of the department is final.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Each ineligible individual shall be given instructions about how to complete the request for redetermination process as provided in subsection (11).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) In the case of a child in foster care who is placed in a qualified residential treatment program, the following requirements apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Within 30 days after the start of each placement in a qualified residential treatment program, a qualified individual must do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Assess the strengths and needs of the child using an age-appropriate, evidence-based, validated, functional assessment tool approved by the secretary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Determine whether the needs of the child can be met with family members or through placement in a foster family home or, if not, which setting would provide the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the least restrictive environment and be consistent with the short-term and long-term goals for the child, as specified in the child's permanency plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Develop a list of child-specific short-term and long-term mental and behavioral health goals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The child placing agency responsible for care and supervision of the child must assemble a team for the child in accordance with the requirements of subdivision (a)(i) and (ii). The qualified individual conducting the assessment required under subdivision (a) must work in conjunction with the child's team while conducting and making the assessment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The child's team, as described in subdivision (b), must consist of all appropriate biological family members, relatives, and other supportive adults of the child, as well as professionals who are a resource to the family of the child, such as teachers, medical or mental health providers who have treated the child, or clergy. In the case of a child who has attained age 14, the team must include members of the permanency planning team for the child that are selected by the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The child placing agency responsible for the child's care and supervision must document in the child's case plan all the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The reasonable and good-faith effort to identify and include all the individuals described in subdivision (c) on the child's team.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) All contact information for members of the team, as well as contact information for other relatives and supportive adults who are not part of the child's team.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Evidence that the assessment required under subdivision (a) is determined in conjunction with the child's team.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) The placement preference of the child's team relative to the assessment that recognizes a child should be placed with his or her sibling unless there is a finding by the court that such placement is contrary to the child's best interests.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vii) If the placement preferences of the child's team and the child are not the placement setting recommended by the qualified individual conducting the assessment under subdivision (a), the reason why the preferences of the child's team and of the child were not recommended.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the qualified individual conducting the assessment determines the child should not be placed in a foster family home, the qualified individual shall specify in writing the reason why the needs of the child cannot be met by the family of the child or in a foster family home. A shortage or lack of foster family homes is not an acceptable reason for determining that the needs of the child cannot be met in a foster family home. The qualified individual must specify in writing why the recommended placement in a qualified residential treatment program is the setting that will provide the child with the most effective and appropriate level of care in the least restrictive environment and how that placement is consistent with the short-term and long-term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Within 60 days after the start of each placement in a qualified residential treatment program, the court, or an administrative body appointed or approved by the court, independently, must do the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Consider the assessment, determination, and documentation made by the qualified individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Determine whether the needs of the child can be met through placement in a foster family home or, if not, whether placement of the child in a qualified residential treatment program provides the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the least restrictive environment and whether that placement is consistent with the goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Approve or disapprove the qualified residential treatment program placement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The written documentation of the determination and approval or disapproval of the placement in a qualified residential treatment program by a court or administrative body under subsection (3) shall be included in and made part of the case plan for the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) As long as a child remains placed in a qualified residential treatment program, the department must submit evidence at each dispositional review hearing and each permanency planning hearing held with respect to the child that does the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Demonstrates that ongoing assessment of the strengths and needs of the child continues to support the determination that the needs of the child cannot be met through placement in a foster family home, that the placement in a qualified residential treatment program provides the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the least restrictive environment, and that the placement is consistent with the short-term and long-term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Documenting the specific treatment or service needs that will be met for the child in the placement and the length of time the child is expected to need the treatment or services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Documents the reasonable efforts made by the department to prepare the child to return home or to be placed with a fit and willing relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive parent, or in a foster family home.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) At each dispositional review hearing and permanency planning hearing held with respect to the child, the court shall approve or disapprove the qualified residential treatment program placement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) In the case of a child who is placed in a qualified residential treatment program for more than 12 consecutive months or 18 nonconsecutive months, or, in the case of a child who has not attained age 13, for more than 6 consecutive or nonconsecutive months, the department shall obtain the signed approval of the director of the department for the continued placement of the child in that setting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) In response to the restrictions on title IV-E foster care payments for child caring institutions in section 472(k) of the family first prevention services act, 42 USC 672(k), the department shall not enact or advance policies or practices that would result in a significant increase in the population of youth in the juvenile justice system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Foster care" means 24-hour substitute care for a child placed away from his or her parent or guardian and for whom the title IV-E agency has placement and care responsibility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Qualified individual" means a trained professional or licensed clinician who is not an employee of the department and who is not connected to, or affiliated with, any placement setting in which children are placed by the department.

The individual must maintain objectivity with respect to determining the most effective and appropriate placement for the child.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>722.124e Legislative findings and declaration; requirement to provide services that conflict with child placing agency's religious beliefs prohibited; adverse action against child placing agency prohibited; information to be provided to applicant; defense in administrative or judicial proceeding; ability of another child placing agency to provide services not limited; definitions.</B><P>Sec. 14e.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The legislature finds and declares all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) When it is necessary for a child in this state to be placed with an adoptive or foster family, placing the child in a safe, loving, and supportive home is a paramount goal of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) As of September 9, 2015, there are 105 licensed adoption and foster care agencies in this state that are authorized to participate in and assist families with adoption and foster parent placements of children.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Having as many possible qualified adoption and foster parent agencies in this state is a substantial benefit to the children of this state who are in need of these placement services and to all of the citizens of this state because the more qualified agencies taking part in this process, the greater the likelihood that permanent child placement can be achieved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) As of September 9, 2015, the adoption and foster care licensees of this state represent a broad spectrum of organizations and groups, some of which are faith based and some of which are not faith based.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Private child placing agencies, including faith-based child placing agencies, have the right to free exercise of religion under both the state and federal constitutions. Under well-settled principles of constitutional law, this right includes the freedom to abstain from conduct that conflicts with an agency's sincerely held religious beliefs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Faith-based and non-faith-based child placing agencies have a long and distinguished history of providing adoption and foster care services in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Children and families benefit greatly from the adoption and foster care services provided by faith-based and non-faith-based child placing agencies. Ensuring that faith-based child placing agencies can continue to provide adoption and foster care services will benefit the children and families who receive publicly funded services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Under well-established contracting practices of the department, a private child placing agency does not receive public funding with respect to a particular child or particular individuals referred by the department unless that agency affirmatively accepts the referral.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Under well-settled principles of constitutional law distinguishing "private action" from "state action", a private child placing agency does not engage in state action when the agency performs private-adoption or direct-placement services. Similarly, a private child placing agency does not engage in state action relative to a referral for services under a contract with the department before the agency accepts the referral. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) To the fullest extent permitted by state and federal law, a child placing agency shall not be required to provide any services if those services conflict with, or provide any services under circumstances that conflict with, the child placing agency's sincerely held religious beliefs contained in a written policy, statement of faith, or other document adhered to by the child placing agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) To the fullest extent permitted by state and federal law, the state or a local unit of government shall not take an adverse action against a child placing agency on the basis that the child placing agency has declined or will decline to provide any services that conflict with, or provide any services under circumstances that conflict with, the child placing agency's sincerely held religious beliefs contained in a written policy, statement of faith, or other document adhered to by the child placing agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a child placing agency declines to provide any services under subsection (2), the child placing agency shall provide in writing information advising the applicant of the department's website, the Michigan adoption resource exchange or similar subsequently utilized websites, and a list of adoption or foster care service providers with contact information and shall do at least 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Promptly refer the applicant to another child placing agency that is willing and able to provide the declined services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Promptly refer the applicant to the webpage on the department's website that identifies other licensed child placement agencies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A child placing agency may assert a defense in an administrative or judicial proceeding based on this section. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a child placing agency declines to provide any services under subsection (2), the child placing agency's decision does not limit the ability of another child placing agency to provide those services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For the purpose of this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Adverse action" includes, but is not limited to, denying a child placing agency's application for funding, refusing to renew the child placing agency's funding, canceling the child placing agency's funding, declining to enter into a contract with the child placing agency, refusing to renew a contract with the child placing agency, canceling a contract with the child placing agency, declining to issue a license to the child placing agency, refusing to renew the child placing agency's license, canceling the child placing agency's license, taking an enforcement action against a child placing agency, discriminating against the child placing agency in regard to participation in a government program, and taking any action that materially alters the terms or conditions of the child placing agency's funding, contract, or license. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Services" includes any service that a child placing agency provides, except foster care case management and adoption services provided under a contract with the department.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the department makes a referral to a child placing agency for foster care case management or adoption services under a contract with the child placing agency, the child placing agency may decide not to accept the referral if the services would conflict with the child placing agency's sincerely held religious beliefs contained in a written policy, statement of faith, or other document adhered to by the child placing agency. Before accepting a referral for services under a contract with the department, the child placing agency has the sole discretion to decide whether to engage in activities and perform services related to that referral. The department shall not control the child placing agency's decision whether to engage in those activities or perform those services. For purposes of this subsection, a child placing agency accepts a referral by doing either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Submitting to the department a written agreement to perform the services related to the particular child or particular individuals that the department referred to the child placing agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Engaging in any other activity that results in the department being obligated to pay the child placing agency for the services related to the particular child or particular individuals that the department referred to the child placing agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The state or a local unit of government shall not take an adverse action against a child placing agency on the basis that the child placing agency has decided to accept or not accept a referral under subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a child placing agency decides not to accept a referral under subsection (1), that occurrence shall not be a factor in determining whether a placement in connection with the referral is in the best interest of the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A child placing agency may assert a defense in an administrative or judicial proceeding based on this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) For the purpose of this section, "adverse action" includes, but is not limited to, denying a child placing agency's application for funding, refusing to renew the child placing agency's funding, canceling the child placing agency's funding, declining to enter into a contract with the child placing agency, refusing to renew a contract with the child placing agency, canceling a contract with the child placing agency, declining to issue a license to the child placing agency, refusing to renew the child placing agency's license, canceling the child placing agency's license, taking an enforcement action against a child placing agency, discriminating against the child placing agency in regard to participation in a government program, and taking any action that materially alters the terms or conditions of the child placing agency's funding, contract, or license.</div>

If an allegation, written report, or subsequent investigation indicates that the individual who committed the suspected child abuse or child neglect is a child care provider and the department believes that the report has basis in fact, the department shall, within 24 hours after completion of the allegation, written report, or subsequent investigation, transmit a copy of the written report or the results of the investigation to the child care regulatory agency with authority over the child care provider's child care organization or adult foster care location authorized to care for a child.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The department must maintain a statewide, electronic case management system to carry out the intent of this act. The department may enter into vendor contracts that it considers necessary and proper for implementation, review, and update of the electronic case management system. The department must solicit proposals from entities to provide the services necessary to implement, review, and update the electronic case management system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The department must classify a confirmed case of methamphetamine production, confirmed serious abuse or neglect, confirmed sexual abuse, or confirmed sexual exploitation, as a central registry case. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In addition to a case classified under subsection (2), a court in this state entering an order of conviction for a violation of section 136b of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.136b, a conviction for a violation of chapter LXXVI of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.520a to 750.520o, involving a minor victim, a conviction for a violation of section 145c of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.145c, and any conviction involving the death of a child must request that the conviction be classified as a central registry case by the department. The department, with cooperation from the state court administrative office, must promulgate rules to regulate this referral process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) At any time, an individual who has been placed on the central registry under subsection (3) may request, and the court shall request, an individual's name be removed from the central registry upon the individual prevailing in a motion to the convicting court for the following reasons:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The individual was not convicted of an offense listed under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Demonstrating that the individual's conviction of the offense that caused the individual to be placed on the central registry has been expunged.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Not more than once every 10 years after an individual has been placed on the central registry under subsection (3), the individual may make a motion to the convicting court to request removal from the central registry. In a hearing on this motion, the individual is presumed to be a risk to children, and the burden is on the individual requesting to be removed from the central registry. If the individual demonstrates that the presumption is unreasonable, the court shall request that the department remove the individual from the central registry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Within 30 days after the classification of a central registry case, the department must notify in writing each person who is named in the record as a perpetrator of the confirmed serious abuse or neglect, confirmed sexual abuse, confirmed sexual exploitation, or confirmed case of methamphetamine production. The notice requirements include all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The notice must be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and delivery restricted to the addressee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The notice must set forth the person's right to request expunction of the record and the right to a hearing if the department refuses the request.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The notice must state that the record may be released under section 7d.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The notice must not identify the person reporting the suspected child abuse or child neglect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An individual who is the subject of a report or record made under this section may request the department amend an inaccurate report or record from the central registry and local office file. This subsection does not apply to an individual for which the court has entered an order of conviction described in subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the department denies the request to amend a report, an individual who is the subject of a report or record made under this section may, within 180 days from the date of service of notice of the right to a hearing, request the department hold a hearing to review the request for amendment. This subsection does not apply to an individual for which the court has entered an order of conviction described in subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The department must hold a hearing to determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether the report or record in whole or in part meets the statutory requirement of confirmed serious abuse or neglect, confirmed sexual abuse, confirmed sexual exploitation, or confirmed case of methamphetamine production and should be amended or expunged from the central registry. The hearing must be held before an administrative law judge and must be conducted as prescribed by the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328. The department may, for good cause, hold a hearing under this subsection if the department determines that the person who is the subject of the report or record submitted the request for a hearing within 60 days after the 180-day notice period expired. This subsection does not apply to an individual for which the court has entered an order of conviction described in subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If the investigation of a report conducted under this section does not show serious child abuse or child neglect, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, or methamphetamine production by a preponderance of the evidence, or if a court dismisses a petition based on the merits of the petition filed under section 2(b) of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.2, because the petitioner has failed to establish, or a court has failed to find, that the child comes within the jurisdiction of the court following an adjudication hearing, the information identifying the subject of the report must be expunged from the central registry after a party has exhausted all appellate remedies and an appellate review does not find that the child is within the jurisdiction of the court. If a preponderance of evidence of child abuse or child neglect exists, or if a court takes jurisdiction of the child under section 2(b) of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.2, the department must maintain the information and must maintain the perpetrator's information in the central registry if the case is determined to be a confirmed case of methamphetamine production, confirmed serious abuse or neglect, confirmed sexual abuse, or confirmed sexual exploitation. This subsection does not apply to an individual for which the court has entered an order of conviction described in subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the department must maintain the information in the central registry until the department receives reliable information that the perpetrator is dead. Not more than once every 10 years after an individual has been listed on the central registry, the individual may request a hearing regarding removal from the central registry. Except for confirmed sexual abuse or confirmed sexual exploitation, the department must hold a hearing to determine whether the information should be maintained on the central registry. The hearing must be held before an administrative law judge and must be conducted as prescribed by the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328. In this hearing, the individual is presumed to be a risk to children and the burden of proof is on the individual requesting to be removed from the central registry. If the individual demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the presumption is unreasonable, then the information must be expunged from the central registry. The facts and circumstances as determined by the department or an administrative law judge on review of the department's decision that resulted in the individual originally being placed on the central registry are not subject to review. The administrative law judge shall take into account the facts and circumstances in the years since the individual was listed on the central registry that bear on the assessment of the individual's risk to children in the future. For the purpose of this subsection, "reliable information" includes, but is not limited to, information obtained using the United States Social Security death index database. This subsection does not apply to an individual for which the court has entered an order of conviction described in subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Upon written request, the department may provide confirmation of central registry placement to an individual, office, or agency authorized to receive it. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) A person or the department may share the document provided in subsection (12) with whoever is appropriate for the purpose of seeking employment or serving as a volunteer if that employment or volunteer work will include contact with children.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) An individual or organization for whom a person is applying for employment, licensing for a child care organization, or to act as a volunteer, may, with appropriate authorization and identification, request and receive confirmation of central registry placement, if that employment or volunteer work includes contact with children.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) A parent or other person responsible for a child, who has reason to believe another caregiver may place that child at risk, may, with appropriate authorization and identification, receive confirmation of central registry placement of that parent, person responsible, or caregiver. This request must be made through the office of the friend of the court created in section 3 of the friend of the court act, 1982 PA 294, MCL 552.503.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) The department may develop an automated system that will allow a person applying for child-related employment or seeking to volunteer in a capacity that would allow unsupervised access to a child for whom the person is not a person responsible for that child's health or welfare to be listed in that system if a screening of the person finds that he or she has not been named in a central registry case as the perpetrator of a confirmed case of methamphetamine production, confirmed serious abuse or neglect, confirmed sexual abuse, or confirmed sexual exploitation. The automated system developed under this section must provide for public access to the list of persons who have been screened for the purposes of complying with this section. An automated system developed under this section must have appropriate safeguards and procedures to ensure that information that is confidential under this act, state law, or federal law is not accessible or disclosed through that system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) An action taken to exclude an individual from licensure to provide foster care, child care, or camp services by the department of licensing and regulatory affairs or the division of child welfare licensing in the department, or a predecessor agency, in effect before the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection, must remain in effect according to its terms, except if an individual is successful in an administrative review or appeal of the exclusionary status in accord with section 9 of 1973 PA 116, MCL 722.119.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) In addition to the central registry clearance, the department must search children's protective services records to determine if an applicant or licensee, relative, adult member of the household, licensee designee, chief administrator, staff member, or unsupervised volunteer has a children's protective services history before making a licensing or placement determination, or provide clearance for staff employment or a volunteer in a child caring organization.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Within 24 hours after receiving a report made under this act, the department must refer the report to the prosecuting attorney and the local law enforcement agency if the report meets the requirements of subsection (3)(a), (b), or (c) or section 3(6) or (9) or must commence an investigation of the child suspected of being abused or neglected. Within 24 hours after receiving a report whether from the reporting person or from the department under subsection (3)(a), (b), or (c) or section 3(6) or (9), the local law enforcement agency must refer the report to the department if the report meets the requirements of section 3(7) or must commence an investigation of the child suspected of being abused or neglected or exposed to or who has had contact with methamphetamine production. If the child suspected of being abused or exposed to or who has had contact with methamphetamine production is not in the physical custody of the parent or legal guardian and informing the parent or legal guardian would not endanger the child's health or welfare, the local law enforcement agency or the department must inform the child's parent or legal guardian of the investigation as soon as the local law enforcement agency or the department discovers the identity of the child's parent or legal guardian.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In the course of its investigation, the department must determine if the child is abused or neglected. The department must cooperate with law enforcement officials, courts of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate state agencies providing human services in relation to preventing, identifying, and treating child abuse and child neglect; must provide, enlist, and coordinate the necessary services, directly or through purchasing services from other agencies and professions; and must take necessary action to prevent further abuses, to safeguard and enhance the child's welfare, and to preserve family life where possible. In the course of an investigation, at the time that a department investigator contacts an individual about whom a report has been made under this act or contacts an individual responsible for the health or welfare of a child about whom a report has been made under this act, the department investigator must advise that individual of the department investigator's name, whom the department investigator represents, and the specific complaints or allegations made against the individual. The department must ensure that its policies, procedures, and administrative rules ensure compliance with this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In conducting its investigation, the department must seek the assistance of and cooperate with law enforcement officials within 24 hours after becoming aware that 1 or more of the following conditions exist:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Child abuse or child neglect is the suspected cause of a child's death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The child is the victim of suspected sexual abuse or sexual exploitation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Child abuse or child neglect resulting in serious physical harm to the child. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Law enforcement intervention is necessary for the protection of the child, a department employee, or another person involved in the investigation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The alleged perpetrator of the child's injury is not a person responsible for the child's health or welfare.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The child has been exposed to or had contact with methamphetamine production.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Law enforcement officials must cooperate with the department in conducting investigations under subsections (1) and (3) and must comply with sections 5 and 7. The department and law enforcement officials must conduct investigations in compliance with the protocols adopted and implemented as required by subsection (6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Involvement of law enforcement officials under this section does not relieve or prevent the department from proceeding with its investigation or treatment if there is reasonable cause to suspect that the child abuse or child neglect was committed by a person responsible for the child's health or welfare.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) In each county, the prosecuting attorney and the department must develop and establish procedures for involving law enforcement officials and children's advocacy centers, as appropriate, as provided in this section. In each county, the prosecuting attorney and the department must adopt and implement standard child abuse and child neglect investigation and interview protocols using as a model the protocols developed by the governor's task force on children's justice as published in FIA Publication 794 (revised 8-98) and FIA Publication 779 (8-98), or an updated version of those publications.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If there is reasonable cause to suspect that a child in the care of or under the control of a public or private agency, institution, or facility is an abused or neglected child, the agency, institution, or facility must be investigated by an agency administratively independent of the agency, institution, or facility being investigated. If the investigation produces evidence of a violation of section 145c or sections 520b to 520g of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.145c and 750.520b to 750.520g, the investigating agency must transmit a copy of the results of the investigation to the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the agency, institution, or facility is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A school or other institution must cooperate with the department during an investigation of a report of child abuse or child neglect. Cooperation includes allowing access to the child without parental consent if access is determined by the department to be necessary to complete the investigation or to prevent child abuse or child neglect of the child. The department must notify the person responsible for the child's health or welfare about the department's contact with the child at the time or as soon afterward as the person can be reached. The department may delay the notice if the notice would compromise the safety of the child or child's siblings or the integrity of the investigation, but only for the time 1 of those conditions exists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the department has contact with a child in a school, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Before contact with the child, the department investigator must review with the designated school staff person the department's responsibilities under this act and the investigation procedure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) After contact with the child, the department investigator must meet with the designated school staff person and the child about the response the department will take as a result of contact with the child. The department may also meet with the designated school staff person without the child present and share additional information the investigator determines may be shared subject to the confidentiality provisions of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Lack of cooperation by the school does not relieve or prevent the department from proceeding with its responsibilities under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A child must not be subjected to a search at a school that requires the child to remove his or her clothing to expose his buttocks or genitalia or her breasts, buttocks, or genitalia unless the department has obtained an order from a court of competent jurisdiction permitting that search. If the access occurs within a hospital, the investigation must be conducted so as not to interfere with the medical treatment of the child or other patients.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The department must enter each report made under this act that is the subject of a field investigation into the electronic case management system. The department must maintain a report entered on the electronic case management system as required by this subsection until the child about whom the investigation is made is 18 years old or until 10 years after the investigation is commenced, whichever is later, or, if the case is classified as a central registry case, until the department receives reliable information that the perpetrator of the child abuse or child neglect is dead. Unless made public as specified information released under section 7d, a report that is maintained on the electronic case management system is confidential and is not subject to the disclosure requirements of the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) After completing a field investigation and based on its results, the department must determine in which single category, prescribed by section 8d, to classify the allegation of child abuse or child neglect and determine whether the child abuse or child neglect must be classified as a central registry case.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) A person who is the subject of a report or record made under this section in which the violation does not result in being placed on the central registry, but is categorized as a category I, II, or III case under section 8d, may request the department amend an inaccurate report or record from the local office file. Within 30 days after the classification of a confirmed case that does not result in being placed on the central registry, the department must notify in writing each person who is named in the report or record as a perpetrator of confirmed serious abuse or neglect. This notice requirement includes all the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Must be sent by first-class mail to the identified perpetrator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Must set forth the person's right to request amendment of the record and the right to an administrative review conducted by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Must state that the record may be released under section 7d, and may impact future employment or licensing opportunities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Must not identify the person reporting the suspected child abuse or child neglect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) The request described in subsection (13) must be made within 180 days after the date of service of notice of a confirmed serious abuse or neglect. The department may, for good cause, extend the time frame for the request after the 180-day notice if the department determines that the person who is the subject of the report or record submitted the request for an administrative review within 60 days after the 180-day notice period expired. The department must create an administrative process to determine whether the report or record should be amended. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) Except as provided in subsection (16), upon completion of the investigation by the local law enforcement agency or the department, the law enforcement agency or department may inform the person who made the report as to the disposition of the report.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) If the person who made the report is mandated to report under section 3, upon completion of the investigation by the department, the department must inform the person in writing as to the disposition of the case and must include in the information at least all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) What determination the department made under subsection (12) and the rationale for that decision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Whether legal action was commenced and, if so, the nature of that action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Notification that the information being conveyed is confidential.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) Information sent under subsection (16) must not include personally identifying information for a person named in a report or record made under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) Unless section 5 of chapter XII of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712.5, requires a physician to report to the department, the surrender of a newborn in compliance with chapter XII of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712.1 to 712.20, is not reasonable cause to suspect child abuse or child neglect and is not subject to the section 3 reporting requirement. This subsection does not apply to circumstances that arise on or after the date that chapter XII of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712.1 to 712.20, is repealed. This subsection applies to a newborn whose birth is described in the born alive infant protection act, 2002 PA 687, MCL 333.1071 to 333.1073, and who is considered to be a newborn surrendered under the safe delivery of newborns law as provided in section 3 of chapter XII of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712.3.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) All department employees involved in investigating child abuse or child neglect cases must be trained in the legal duties to protect the state and federal constitutional and statutory rights of children and families from the initial contact of an investigation through the time services are provided.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) The department must determine whether there is an open friend of the court case regarding a child who is suspected of being abused or neglected if a child protective services investigation of child abuse and child neglect allegations result in any of the following dispositions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A finding that a preponderance of evidence indicates that there has been child abuse or child neglect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Emergency removal of the child for child abuse or child neglect before the investigation is completed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The family court takes jurisdiction on a petition and a child is maintained in his or her own home under the supervision of the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If 1 or more children residing in the home are removed and 1 or more children remain in the home.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Any other circumstances that the department determines are applicable and related to child safety.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) If the department determines that there is an open friend of the court case and the provisions of subsection (20) apply, the department must notify the office of the friend of the court in the county in which the friend of the court case is open that there is an investigation being conducted under this act regarding that child and must also report to the local friend of the court office when there is a change in that child's placement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) Child protective services may report to the local friend of the court office any situation in which a parent, more than 3 times within 1 year or on 5 cumulative reports over several years, made unfounded reports to child protective services regarding alleged child abuse or child neglect of his or her child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(23) If the department determines that there is an open friend of the court case, the department must provide a noncustodial parent of a child who is suspected of being abused or neglected with the form developed by the department that has information on how to change a custody or parenting time court order.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Category III - community services needed. The department determines that there is a preponderance of evidence of child abuse or child neglect, and the structured decision-making tool indicates a low or moderate risk of future harm to the child. The department must assist the child's family in receiving community-based services commensurate with the risk to the child. If the family does not voluntarily participate in services, or the family voluntarily participates in services, but does not progress toward alleviating the child's risk level, the department must consider reclassifying the case as category II.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Category II - child protective services required. The department determines that there is evidence of child abuse or child neglect, and the structured decision-making tool indicates a high or intensive risk of future harm to the child. The department must open a protective services case and provide the services necessary under this act. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Category I - court petition required. The department determines that there is evidence of child abuse or child neglect and 1 or more of the following are true:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A court petition is required under another provision of this act.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Published research overwhelmingly finds that ultra-violent explicit video games are harmful to minors because minors who play ultra-violent explicit video games are consistently more likely to exhibit violent, asocial, or aggressive behavior and have feelings of aggression.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Spokespersons for not less than 6 major national health associations have concluded and testified that after reviewing more than 1,000 studies, the studies "point overwhelmingly to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children", concluding that the effects of media violence on minors "are measurable and long-lasting".</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Law enforcement officers testified that recent statewide targeted enforcement efforts reveal that minors are capable of purchasing, and do purchase, ultra-violent explicit video games.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Law enforcement officers testified about cases of minors acting out ultra-violent explicit video game behaviors by victimizing other citizens.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the court determines the expense to be reasonable and necessary, apportion the expense between the parents based on each parent's ability to pay and on any other relevant factor, in the same manner as health care expenses of a child are divided under the child support formula established under section 19 of the friend of the court act, 1982 PA 294, MCL 552.519.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) In the court's discretion, if 1 parent has paid the expense, require the parent who did not pay the expense to pay his or her share of the expense to the other parent. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An action under this act shall be brought in the circuit court by the mother, the father, a child who became 18 years of age after August 15, 1984 and before June 2, 1986, or the department of human services as provided in this act. The Michigan court rules for civil actions apply to all proceedings under this act. A complaint shall be filed in the county where the mother or child resides. If both the mother and child reside outside of this state, then the complaint shall be filed in the county where the putative father resides or is found. The fact that the child was conceived or born outside of this state is not a bar to entering a complaint against the putative father. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An action to determine paternity shall not be brought under this act if the child's father acknowledges paternity under the acknowledgment of parentage act, or if the child's paternity is established under the law of another state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An action under this act may be commenced during the pregnancy of the child's mother or at any time before the child reaches 18 years of age. For a child who became 18 years of age after August 15, 1984 and before June 2, 1986, an action under this act may be commenced before January 1, 1995. This subsection applies regardless of whether the cause of action accrued before June 1, 1986 and regardless of whether the cause of action was barred under this subsection before June 1, 1986. A summons issued under this section shall be in the form the court determines and shall be served in the same manner as is provided by court rules for the service of process in civil actions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the county department of human services of the county in which the mother or alleged father resides first determines that she or he has physical possession of the child and is eligible for public assistance or without means to employ an attorney; if the department of human services is the complainant; or if the mother, alleged father, or child is receiving services under part D of title IV of the social security act, 42 USC 651 to 669b, then the prosecuting attorney shall initiate and conduct proceedings under this act. The child support formula developed under section 19 of the friend of the court act, 1982 PA 294, MCL 552.519, shall be used as a guideline in petitioning for child support. A complaint filed under this act shall be verified by oath or affirmation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The prosecuting attorney and the department of human services may enter into an agreement to transfer the prosecutor's responsibilities under this act to 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The friend of the court, with the approval of the chief judge of the circuit court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An attorney employed or contracted by the county under section 1 of 1941 PA 15, MCL 49.71.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An attorney employed by or under contract with the department of human services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A proceeding under this section is conducted on behalf of the state and not as the attorney for any other party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The party filing the complaint shall name the person believed to be the father of the child and state in the complaint the time and place, as near as possible, when and where the mother became pregnant. If the department of human services is the plaintiff, the required facts shall be stated upon information and belief. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Upon the filing of a complaint, the court shall issue a summons against the named defendant. If the defendant does not file and serve a responsive pleading as required by the court rules, the court may enter a default judgment. Neither party is required to testify before entry of a default judgment in a proceeding under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If, after service of process, the parties fail to consent to an order naming the man as the child's father as provided in this act within the time permitted for a responsive pleading, then the department of human services or its designee may file and serve both the mother and the alleged father with a notice requiring that the mother, alleged father, and child appear for genetic paternity testing as provided in section 6.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If the mother, alleged father, or child does not appear for genetic paternity testing as provided in subsection (9), then the department of human services or its designee may apply to the court for an order compelling genetic paternity tests as provided in section 6 or may seek other relief as permitted by statute or court rule. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) It is unnecessary in any proceedings under this act commenced by or against a minor to have a next friend or guardian ad litem appointed for the minor unless required by the circuit judge. A minor may prosecute or defend any proceedings in the same manner and with the same effect as if he or she were of legal age.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If a child born out of wedlock is being supported in whole or in part by public assistance, including medical assistance, the department of human services may file a complaint on behalf of the child in the circuit court in the county in which the child resides. The mother or alleged father of the child shall be made a party plaintiff and notified of the hearing on the complaint by summons. The complaint made by the department of human services shall be verified by the director of the department of human services, or his or her designated representative, or by the director of the county department of human services of the county in which an action is brought, or the county director's designated representative. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) 1986 PA 107, which added this subsection, does not affect the rights of an indigent defendant in proceedings under this act as established by decisions of the courts of this state before June 1, 1986.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) If a determination of paternity is made under this act, the court may enter an order of filiation as provided in section 7. Regardless of who commences an action under this act, an order of filiation entered under this act has the same effect, is subject to the same provisions, and is enforced in the same manner as an order of filiation entered on complaint of the mother or father.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) In a proceeding under this act before trial, the court, upon application made by or on behalf of either party, or on its own motion, shall order that the mother, child, and alleged father submit to blood or tissue typing determinations that may include, but are not limited to, determinations of red cell antigens, red cell isoenzymes, human leukocyte antigens, serum proteins, or DNA identification profiling, to determine whether the alleged father is likely to be, or is not, the father of the child. If the court orders a blood or tissue typing or DNA identification profiling to be conducted and a party refuses to submit to the typing or DNA identification profiling, in addition to any other remedies available, the court may do either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Enter a default judgment at the request of the appropriate party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If a trial is held, allow the disclosure of the fact of the refusal unless good cause is shown for not disclosing the fact of refusal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A blood or tissue typing or DNA identification profiling shall be conducted by a person accredited for paternity determinations by a nationally recognized scientific organization, including, but not limited to, the American association of blood banks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The court shall fix the compensation of an expert at a reasonable amount and may direct the compensation to be paid by the county or by any other party to the case, or by both in the proportions and at the times the court prescribes. Before blood or tissue typing or DNA identification profiling is conducted, the court may order a part or all of the compensation paid in advance. If the department of human services paid for the genetic testing expenses, the court may order repayment by the alleged father if the court declares paternity. Documentation of the genetic testing expenses is admissible as evidence of the amount, which evidence constitutes prima facie evidence of the amount of those expenses without third party foundation testimony.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Subject to subsection (5), the result of blood or tissue typing or a DNA identification profile and the summary report shall be served on the mother and alleged father. The summary report shall be filed with the court. Objection to the DNA identification profile or summary report is waived unless made in writing, setting forth the specific basis for the objection, within 14 calendar days after service on the mother and alleged father. The court shall not schedule a trial on the issue of paternity until after the expiration of the 14-day period. If an objection is not filed, the court shall admit in proceedings under this act the result of the blood or tissue typing or the DNA identification profile and the summary report without requiring foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy. If an objection is filed within the 14-day period, on the motion of either party, the court shall hold a hearing to determine the admissibility of the DNA identification profile or summary report. The objecting party has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence by a qualified person described in subsection (2) that foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy is necessary for admission of the DNA identification profile or summary report.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the probability of paternity determined by the qualified person described in subsection (2) conducting the blood or tissue typing or DNA identification profiling is 99% or higher, and the DNA identification profile and summary report are admissible as provided in subsection (4), paternity is established. If the results of the analysis of genetic testing material from 2 or more persons indicate a probability of paternity greater than 99%, the contracting laboratory shall conduct additional genetic paternity testing until all but 1 of the putative fathers is eliminated, unless the dispute involves 2 or more putative fathers who have identical DNA.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) This section does not abrogate the right of either party to child support from the date of birth of the child if applicable under section 7.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as authorized under this act, a person shall not disclose information obtained from genetic paternity testing that is authorized under this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If an alleged father who is tested as part of an action under this act is found to be the child's father, the contracting laboratory shall retain the genetic testing material of the alleged father, mother, and child for no longer than the period of years prescribed by the national standards under which the laboratory is accredited. If a man is found not to be the child's father, the contracting laboratory shall destroy the man's genetic testing material after it is used in the paternity action, in compliance with section 13811 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.13811, and in the presence of a witness. The witness may be an individual who is a party to the destruction of the genetic testing material. After the man's genetic testing material is destroyed, the contracting laboratory shall make and keep a written record of the destruction and have the individual who witnessed the destruction sign the record. The contracting laboratory shall also expunge the contracting laboratory's records regarding the genetic paternity testing performed on the genetic testing material in accordance with the national standards under which the laboratory is accredited. The contracting laboratory shall retain the genetic testing material of the mother and child for no longer than the period of years prescribed by the national standards under which the laboratory is accredited. After a contracting laboratory destroys an individual's genetic testing material as provided in this subsection, it shall notify the adult individual, or the parent or legal guardian of a minor individual, by certified mail that the genetic testing material was destroyed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A contracting laboratory, the family independence agency or its designee, or another entity involved with the genetic paternity testing are all required to protect the confidentiality of genetic testing material, except as required for a paternity determination under this act. The court, its officers, and the family independence agency shall not use or disclose genetic testing material for a purpose other than the paternity determination as authorized by this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A person shall not sell, transfer, or offer genetic testing material obtained under this act except as authorized by this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A contracting laboratory shall annually cause to be conducted an independent audit verifying the contracting laboratory's compliance with this section and section 6.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) In an action under this act, the court shall enter an order of filiation declaring paternity and providing for the support of the child under 1 or more of the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The finding of the court or the verdict determines that the man is the father.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The defendant acknowledges paternity either orally to the court or by filing with the court a written acknowledgment of paternity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The defendant is served with summons and a default judgment is entered against him or her.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Genetic testing under section 6 determines that the man is the father.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An order of filiation entered under subsection (1) shall specify the sum to be paid weekly or otherwise, as prescribed in section 5 of the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.605, until the child reaches the age of 18. Subject to section 5b of the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.605b, the court may also order support for a child after he or she reaches 18 years of age. In addition to providing for the support of the child, the order shall also provide for the payment of the necessary expenses connected to the mother's pregnancy and the birth of the child and for the funeral expenses if the child has died, as determined by the court under section 2. A child support obligation is only retroactive to the date that the paternity complaint was filed unless any of the following circumstances exist:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The defendant was avoiding service of process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The defendant threatened or coerced through domestic violence or other means the complainant not to file a proceeding under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The defendant otherwise delayed the imposition of a support obligation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A judgment or order entered under this act providing for the support of a child or payment of expenses connected to the mother's pregnancy or the birth of the child is enforceable as provided in the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.601 to 552.650. If this act contains a specific provision regarding the contents or enforcement of a support order that conflicts with a provision in the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.601 to 552.650, this act controls in regard to that provision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Upon entry of an order of filiation, the clerk of the court shall collect a fee of $9.00 for entering the order and the fee imposed by section 2891(9)(a) of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.2891, from the person against whom the order of filiation is entered. The clerk shall retain the $9.00 fee and remit the fee imposed by section 2891(9)(a) of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.2891, with a written report of the order of filiation, to the director of the department of community health. The report shall be on a form prescribed by or in a manner approved by the director of the department of community health. Regardless of whether the fees required by this section are collected, the clerk shall transmit and the department of community health shall receive the report of the order of filiation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If an order of filiation or acknowledgment of parentage is abrogated by a later judgment or order of a court, the clerk of the court that entered the order shall immediately communicate that fact to the director of the department of community health on a form prescribed by the director of the department of community health. An order of filiation supersedes an acknowledgment of parentage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Within the time prescribed by court rule, the party, attorney, or agency that secures the signing of an order of filiation shall serve a copy of the order on all parties to the action and file proof of service with the court clerk.</div>

<P>Sec. 9.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The person so adjudged to be the father of the child may be required to give bond with 1 or more sufficient sureties to the satisfaction of the court, to perform the order of the court, and to indemnify the county that is chargeable with the confinement expenses and with the maintenance of the child. The bond shall be filed with the friend of the court or the clerk of the court. If on the trial he is adjudged not to be the father of the child, the court shall dismiss the complaint; and the judgment of the court is final.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If default is made in the payment of an installment or a part of the installment, mentioned in the bond filed under subsection (1), the judge of the court in which the bond is filed, at the request of the mother, guardian, or any other person interested in the support of the child, shall issue a citation to the principal and sureties in the bond requiring them to appear on a day specified in the citation, and show cause why execution shall not issue against them for the amount of the installment due and unpaid on the bond. The citation shall be served by the sheriff of any county in which the principal or sureties reside or may be found. If the amount due on the installment is not paid on or before the time mentioned for showing cause, the judge shall render judgment in favor of the complainant against the principal and sureties who have been served with the citation, for the amount unpaid on the installment due on the bond. Execution shall issue from the court against the goods and chattels of the person or persons against whom the judgment is rendered for the amount of the judgment and costs to the sheriff of any county in the state where a party to the judgment resides or has property subject to the execution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The judge, in case of default in the payment, when due, of any installment or any part of the installment or in the condition of the bond, may adjudge the reputed father guilty of contempt of court as provided in sections 31 to 39 of the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.631 to 552.639. The commitment of the reputed father under sections 31 to 39 of the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.631 to 552.639, does not operate to stay or defeat the obtaining of judgment and the collection of the judgment by execution.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The guardianship assistance agreement must specify all of the following:</div>

The payment includes the determination of care rate that was paid or would have been paid for the child in a foster care placement, except that the amount must be increased to reflect the increase made in the standard age-appropriate foster care rate paid by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The department must review the eligibility of the guardian and the child for continuation of guardianship assistance annually. The guardian must provide the eligibility information requested by the department for purposes of the annual review.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   That the juvenile division of the probate court may, upon learning of the suspected sexual abuse, immediately hold a preliminary inquiry to determine whether a petition for court jurisdiction should be filed or whether other action should be taken.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)   That after a petition has been filed, the juvenile court may order that the minor be placed with someone other than her parent or legal guardian pending trial or further court order if such placement is necessary to avoid substantial risk to the minor's life, physical health, or mental well-being.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   As used in this section, "child abuse" and "sexual abuse" mean those terms as defined in section 2 of the child protection law, Act No. 238 of the Public Acts of 1975, being section 722.622 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Reasonable efforts must be made to do the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) In the case of siblings removed from their home who are not jointly placed, provide for at least monthly visitation or other ongoing contact between the siblings, unless the supervising agency documents that at least monthly visitation or other ongoing contact would be contrary to the safety or well-being of any of the siblings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If siblings cannot be placed together or not all the siblings are being placed in foster care, the supervising agency must make reasonable efforts to facilitate at least monthly visitation or other ongoing contact with siblings unless a court has determined that at least monthly visitation or other ongoing contact with siblings would not be beneficial under section 13a(16) of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.13a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the supervising agency discontinues visitation or other ongoing contact with siblings because the supervising agency determines that visitation or other ongoing contact is contrary to the safety or well-being of any of the siblings, the supervising agency must report its determination to the court for consideration at the next review hearing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A person who receives a written decision described in subsection (4) may request in writing, within 5 days, documentation of the reasons for the decision, and if the person does not agree with the placement decision, he or she may request that the child's attorney review the decision to determine if the decision is in the child's best interest. If the child's attorney determines the decision is not in the child's best interest, within 14 days after the date of the written decision the attorney must petition the court that placed the child out of the child's home for a review hearing. The court must commence the review hearing not more than 7 days after the date of the attorney's petition and must hold the hearing on the record.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If there is no previous child-custody determination that is entitled to be enforced under this act and if a child-custody proceeding has not been commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under sections 201 to 203, a child-custody determination made under this section remains in effect until an order is obtained from a court of a state having jurisdiction under sections 201 to 203. If a child-custody proceeding has not been or is not commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under sections 201 to 203, a child-custody determination made under this section becomes a final child-custody determination, if that is what the determination provides and this state becomes the home state of the child.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If there is a previous child-custody determination that is entitled to be enforced under this act or if a child-custody proceeding has been commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under sections 201 to 203, an order issued by a court of this state under this section must specify in the order a period of time that the court considers adequate to allow the person seeking an order to obtain an order from the state having jurisdiction under sections 201 to 203. The order issued in this state remains in effect until an order is obtained from the other state within the period specified or the period expires.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a court of this state that has been asked to make a child-custody determination under this section is informed that a child-custody proceeding has been commenced in, or that a child-custody determination has been made by, a court of a state having jurisdiction under sections 201 to 203, the court of this state shall immediately communicate with the other court. If a court of this state that is exercising jurisdiction under sections 201 to 203 is informed that a child-custody proceeding has been commenced in, or a child-custody determination has been made by, a court of another state under a statute similar to this section, the court of this state shall immediately communicate with the court of the other state.

<P>Sec. 207.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A court of this state that has jurisdiction under this act to make a child-custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum. The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon the motion of a party, the court's own motion, or the request of another court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this state shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to submit information and shall consider all relevant factors, including all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The length of time the child has resided outside this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The distance between the court in this state and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The parties' relative financial circumstances.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   An agreement by the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including the child's testimony.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   The ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   The familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues of the pending litigation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a court of this state determines that it is an inconvenient forum and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon condition that a child-custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another designated state and may impose any other condition the court considers just and proper.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A court of this state may decline to exercise jurisdiction under this act if a child-custody determination is incidental to an action for divorce or another proceeding while still retaining jurisdiction over the divorce or other proceeding.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided in section 204 or by other law of this state, if a court of this state has jurisdiction under this act because a person invoking the court's jurisdiction has engaged in unjustifiable conduct, the court shall decline to exercise its jurisdiction unless the court finds 1 or more of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The parents and all persons acting as parents have acquiesced in the exercise of jurisdiction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A court of the state otherwise having jurisdiction under sections 201 to 203 determines that this state is a more appropriate forum under section 207.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a court of this state declines to exercise its jurisdiction under subsection (1), the court may fashion an appropriate remedy to ensure the safety of the child and prevent a repetition of the unjustifiable conduct, including staying the proceeding until a child-custody proceeding is commenced in a court having jurisdiction under sections 201 to 203.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a court dismisses a petition or stays a proceeding because it declines to exercise jurisdiction under subsection (1), it shall charge the party invoking the jurisdiction of the court with necessary and reasonable expenses including costs, communication expenses, attorney fees, investigative fees, witness expenses, travel expenses, and child care expenses during the course of the proceedings, unless the party from whom expenses and fees are sought establishes that the award would be clearly inappropriate. The court may not assess fees, costs, or expenses against this state unless authorized by law other than this act.</DIV>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>722.1443 Court action.</B><P>Sec. 13.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An original action under this act shall be filed in the circuit court for the county in which the mother or the child resides or, if neither the mother nor the child reside in this state, in the circuit court for the county in which the child was born. If an action for the support, custody, or parenting time of the child exists at any stage of the proceedings in a circuit court of this state or if an action under section 2(b) of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.2, is pending in a circuit court of this state, an action under this act shall be brought by motion in the existing case under rules adopted by the supreme court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In an action filed under this act, the court may do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Revoke an acknowledgment of parentage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Determine that a genetic father is not a child's father.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Set aside an order of filiation or a paternity order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Determine that a child was born out of wedlock.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Make a determination of paternity and enter an order of filiation as provided for under section 7 of the paternity act, 1956 PA 205, MCL 722.717.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A judgment entered under this act does not relieve a man from a support obligation for the child or the child's mother that was incurred before the action was filed or prevent a person from seeking relief under applicable court rules to vacate or set aside a judgment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A court may refuse to enter an order setting aside a paternity determination, revoking an acknowledgment of parentage, determining that a genetic father is not a child's father, or determining that a child is born out of wedlock if the court finds evidence that the order would not be in the best interests of the child. The court shall state its reasons for refusing to enter an order on the record. The court may consider the following factors:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Whether the presumed father is estopped from denying parentage because of his conduct.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The length of time the presumed father was on notice that he might not be the child's father.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The facts surrounding the presumed father's discovery that he might not be the child's father.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The nature of the relationship between the child and the presumed or alleged father.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The age of the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The harm that may result to the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Other factors that may affect the equities arising from the disruption of the father-child relationship.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Any other factor that the court determines appropriate to consider.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The court shall order the parties to an action or motion under this act to participate in and pay for blood or tissue typing or DNA identification profiling to assist the court in making a determination under this act. Blood or tissue typing or DNA identification profiling shall be conducted in accordance with section 6 of the paternity act, 1956 PA 205, MCL 722.716. The results of blood or tissue typing or DNA identification profiling are not binding on a court in making a determination under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the case is a title IV-D case, the court may appoint an attorney approved by the office of child support to represent this state's interests with respect to an action or a motion under this act. The court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the child's interests with respect to the action or motion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A court shall not issue an order under this act that sets aside a judgment or determination of a court or administrative agency of another state, even if the judgment or determination is being enforced in this state, or that is inconsistent with 28 USC 1738A or 28 USC 1738B.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) This act does not establish a basis for termination of an adoption and does not affect any obligation of an adoptive parent to an adoptive child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) This act does not establish a basis for vacating a judgment establishing paternity of a child conceived under a surrogate parentage contract as that term is defined in section 3 of the surrogate parenting act, 1988 PA 199, MCL 722.853.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A common law action that was available before June 12, 2012 to set aside a paternity determination or to determine that a child is born out of wedlock remains available until June 12, 2014, but is not available after June 12, 2014.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Except for an action filed under section 15(2), a court, in its discretion, may order a person who files an action or motion under this act to post an amount of money with the court, obtain a surety, or provide other assurances that in the court's determination will secure the costs of the action and attorney fees if the person does not prevail. The court, in its discretion, may order a nonprevailing party, including a mother who is a nonprevailing party under section 15(2), to pay the reasonable attorney fees and costs of a prevailing party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A court may extend the time for filing an action or motion under this act. A request for extension shall be supported by an affidavit signed by the person requesting the extension stating facts that the person satisfied all the requirements for filing an action or motion under this act but did not file the action or motion within the time allowed under this act because of 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Mistake of fact.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Newly discovered evidence that by due diligence could not have been found earlier.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Fraud.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Misrepresentation or misconduct.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Duress.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) If the court finds that an affidavit under subsection (12) is sufficient, the court may allow the action or motion to be filed and take other action the court considers appropriate.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Genetic testing that determines a man is the biological father of a child under this act establishes paternity. If genetic testing establishes paternity as described in this subsection, the mother is granted initial custody of the child, without prejudice to the determination of either parent's custodial rights, until otherwise determined by the court or otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing and acknowledged by the court. This grant of initial custody to the mother does not, by itself, affect the rights of either parent in a proceeding to seek a court order for custody or parenting time. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the paternity of a child born out of wedlock has not otherwise been established and the child is either supported in whole or in part by public assistance or if either party has signed an application for services under title IV-D, the department may request a title IV-D agency to file a statement with the court in the county in which the mother, the child, or the alleged father lives. The statement shall be in a form approved by the state court administrative office under the supervision and direction of the supreme court. The statement shall include the names of the parties, the date of the child's birth, and the time and place as near as possible of the child's conception. If the mother or alleged father signs the statement, the statement must be verified as required by supreme court rules. A statement filed by the title IV-D agency on behalf of the mother, child, or alleged father does not have to be verified. The person on whose behalf the statement is filed is the filing party under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The title IV-D agency filing the statement in subsection (1) shall serve a copy of the statement and a notice of intent to establish paternity on the parties. The notice shall be in a form established by the state court administrative office under the supervision and direction of the supreme court and shall include all of the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That the man has been named as the child's father.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That the nonfiling party must respond to the title IV-D agency within 21 days by doing 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Admitting paternity in writing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Submitting a written request for genetic testing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Producing proof that the alleged father has been excluded as the father under the laws of this or another state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) That, if a party requests genetic testing, the mother, child, and alleged father must submit to genetic testing at the date, time, and place determined by the title IV-D agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) That, if neither party requests genetic testing within 21 days or produces proof that the alleged father has been excluded as the father under the laws of this or another state, the alleged father is established as the child's legal father.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Upon filing of the statement and notice with the court and subject to service under subsection (4), the court may do 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Establish a child's paternity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Issue a support order under this act.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The statement and notice under subsection (2) may be sent by regular mail, but if the nonfiling party does not respond in writing admitting paternity or requesting genetic testing, the statement and notice shall be served in the same manner as provided by court rules for the service of process in civil matters. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Unless the court enters an order declaring that the alleged father is not the child's father, both parents must provide information as requested by the title IV-D agency sufficient to allow the title IV-D agency to calculate support under the support formula.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the court enters an order under this act and there is no dispute regarding custody, the court shall include in the order specific provisions for the custody and parenting time of the child as provided in the child custody act of 1970. If there is a dispute between the parties concerning custody or parenting time, the court shall immediately enter an order that establishes support and temporarily establishes custody of and parenting time with the child. Pending a hearing on or other resolution of the dispute, the court may also refer the matter to the friend of the court for a report and recommendation as provided in section 5 of the friend of the court act, MCL 552.505. In a dispute regarding custody or parenting time, the title IV-D agency or its successor as provided in section 11(2) is not required to represent either party regarding that dispute.</div>

The court shall provide notice and an opportunity for the parties to be heard and shall do either of the following:</div>

The court may not enter an order under this act that does not recognize an individual's paternity established under another law of this state or another state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the court enters an order under this act and there is no dispute regarding custody, the court shall include in the order specific provisions for the custody and parenting time of the child as provided in the child custody act of 1970.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The respondent to a petition under subsection (1) shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard at the earliest possible time after the ex parte warrant is executed, but not later than the next judicial day unless a hearing on that date is impossible. If a hearing on the next judicial day is impossible, the court shall hold the hearing on the first judicial day possible.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An ex parte warrant under subsection (1) to take physical custody of a child shall do all of the following: </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The department of state police shall store and retain all fingerprints submitted under this section in an automated fingerprint identification system database that searches against latent fingerprints and provides for an automatic notification when a subsequent fingerprint is submitted into the system that matches a set of fingerprints previously submitted under this section or when the criminal history of an individual whose fingerprints are retained in the system is updated.
