<P>Sec. 5.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The resolution shall provide for a partisan election of a charter commission, for the nomination of candidates for the charter commission by petitioning or filing a fee, and for a primary election of charter commission candidates. A charter commission candidate who elects to pay a filing fee shall pay the fee not less than 3 days before the final day upon which petitions may be filed. The resolution shall provide for the election of charter commissioners from districts established by the county apportionment commission. The county apportionment commission shall consist of the county clerk, the county treasurer, the prosecuting attorney, and the statutory county chairperson of each of the 2 political parties receiving the greatest number of votes cast for the office of secretary of state in the last general election in which a secretary of state was elected. If a county does not have a statutory chairperson of a political party, the 2 additional members shall be a party representative from each of the 2 political parties receiving the greatest number of votes cast for the office of secretary of state in the last general election in which a secretary of state was elected and appointed by the chairperson of the state central committee for each of the political parties. The county clerk shall convene the county apportionment commission and the county apportionment commission shall adopt the rules of procedure. Three members of the county apportionment commission are a quorum sufficient to conduct its business. All action of the apportionment commission shall be by majority vote of the apportionment commission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The county apportionment commission, within 30 days after the adoption of the resolution by the county board of commissioners, shall establish charter commission districts equal to the number of charter commissioners to be elected. All districts shall be single member districts and as equal in population as practicable. The latest official published figures of the United States official census shall be used in this determination, except that in cases requiring a division of official census units to meet the population standard, an actual population count may be used to make the division. Other governmental census figures of total population may be used if taken after the last decennial United States census and the United States census figures are not adequate for the purposes of this act. The secretary of state shall furnish the latest official published figures to the county apportionment commission within 15 days after publication of subsequent United States official census figures. A contract may be entered into with the United States census bureau to conduct a special census if the latest United States decennial census figures are not adequate. Each district shall be contiguous, compact, and as nearly square in shape as is practicable, depending on the geography of the county area involved, and shall be drawn without regard to partisan political advantage. Each city and township shall be apportioned so that it shall have the largest possible number of complete districts within its boundaries before any part of the city or township is joined to territory outside the boundaries of the city or township to form a district. Townships, villages, cities, and precincts shall be divided only if necessary to meet the population standard.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In a county having a population of less than 1,500,000, the date of the primary election for charter commissioners may be the same as the date for the submisson of the question as provided in section 3. Otherwise, the date of the primary election for charter commissioners shall be the same as the date for the submission of the question as provided in section 3. The election of the charter commission shall be at the next primary or general election occurring not less than 60 days after the primary election for charter commissioners. If a regular primary or general election does not occur within 180 days after the date of the primary, the county board of commissioners shall provide, in the resolution, for a date on which the final election of the commission shall be held.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The apportionment plan approved by the apportionment commission shall be filed in the office of the county clerk at which time the plan shall become effective, and copies of the plan immediately shall be forwarded by the county clerk to the secretary of state for filing. The plan shall be made available at cost to any registered voter of the county.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Any registered voter of the county, within 30 days after the filing of the plan for his or her county, may petition the court of appeals to review the plan to determine if the plan meets the requirements of the laws of this state. A finding of the court of appeals may be appealed to the supreme court of this state as provided by law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If the apportionment commission has failed to submit a plan for its county within 60 days but not less than 30 days after the latest official published census figures are available or within an additional time as may be granted by the court of appeals for good cause shown on petition from the apportionment commission, any registered voter of the county may submit a plan to the commission for approval. The apportionment commission shall choose, from among those plans submitted, a plan meeting the requirements of the laws of this state and shall file the plan in the office of the county clerk as provided in this section within 30 days after the deadline for filing of the apportionment commission's own plan or any extension granted on the filing of the plan.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Once an apportionment plan has been found constitutional and not in violation of this act and all appeals have been exhausted or, if an appeal has not been taken, when the time for appeal has expired, that plan shall be the official apportionment plan for the county until the next United States official decennial census figures are available. When the next United States official decennial census figures are available, a new apportionment plan under this act shall be established by the county apportionment commission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The electors of each district established pursuant to this act shall elect 1 charter commissioner. There shall not be representation other than that set forth by this act.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The charter shall be submitted to the governor for approval within 30 days after its completion. The charter may be approved by the governor upon written recommendation of the attorney general that it conforms to the provisions of the constitution and the statutes of this state. The governor either shall approve or reject the charter within 30 days of its submission. If the governor rejects the charter, he shall return it to the charter commission together with a copy of his reasons therefor. Upon the return of the unapproved charter, the commission shall reconvene, consider the reasons for rejection, revise the proposed charter and submit the revised charter to the governor within a period of 45 days. Upon resubmission, the governor either shall approve or reject the charter within 30 days of its resubmission. If the governor rejects the charter, he shall notify the commission of his action and his reasons therefor. Upon the second rejection of the charter, the commission, within 30 days, either shall reconvene and revise the charter to comply with the governor's objections or it shall take all steps necessary to obtain a judicial interpretation to determine whether the charter conforms to the provisions of the constitution and statutes of this state. Upon approval of the charter by the governor or upon a final favorable judicial interpretation, the commission, within 10 days, shall fix the date, by resolution, for the submission of the proposed charter to the electorate for its adoption. The submission shall be at the time of the next regular primary election occurring not less than 60 days from the adoption of the resolution. If there is not to be a regular primary election within 180 days, the charter commission may provide in the resolution for a special election on the question of the adoption or rejection of the charter. The resolution shall also establish the date for a primary and general election of officers for the newly created elective offices, whose first term shall be for a period ending at the same time as that of the incumbent governor. Thereafter, they shall be elected for 4-year terms concurrent with the terms of the governor. The manner of nomination and election of home rule county officers shall be in all respects the same as that heretofore established for regular county officers. If the charter is submitted to the electors for approval or rejection at any time prior to the regular primary election, at which time such elective county officers as there shall be in the county are regularly nominated prior to the effective date of this act, then all incumbent elective county officers whose offices are retained in the charter shall continue in office until the expiration of the term for which they were last elected, respectively.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An optional unified form of county government shall be adopted and become effective in the following manner:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The county board of commissioners, by a majority vote of the members elected and serving, may adopt an optional unified form of county government with an appointed manager. The adoption shall be submitted to the electors pursuant to subdivisions (d) and (e). A vote of disapproval by the electors shall not limit the power of the county board of commissioners to subsequently adopt an optional unified form of county government with an elected county executive pursuant to subdivision (b). A county board of commissioners shall not adopt an optional unified form of county government with an appointed manager within 2 years after an optional unified form of county government with an appointed manager is disapproved by the electors.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The county board of commissioners, by a majority vote of the members elected and serving, may adopt an optional unified form of county government with an elected county executive. The adoption shall be submitted to the electors pursuant to subdivisions (d) and (e). A vote of disapproval by the electors shall not limit the power of the county board of commissioners to subsequently adopt an optional unified form of county government with an appointed manager pursuant to subdivision (a). A county board of commissioners shall not adopt an optional unified form of county government with an elected executive within 2 years after an optional unified form of county government with an elected executive is disapproved by the electors.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Within 90 days after the adoption of an optional unified form of county government by the county board of commissioners, petitions bearing the signatures of registered electors of the county equal to not less than 5% of the total number of votes cast for governor in the county in the last election at which a governor was elected, requesting adoption of the other optional unified form of county government may be filed with the county clerk. The county clerk shall canvass and certify the sufficiency of the petitions within 14 days after the filing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The election to be held on the question of an optional unified form of county government pursuant to the action of the county board of commissioners or pursuant to that action and the filing of petitions, shall be held at the next regular primary election occurring not less than 49 days nor more than 180 days following the date of the action of the county board of commissioners or the date of the certification of the petition, whichever is later. If a regular primary election is not scheduled during that period, the board of county commissioners shall call a special election for the purpose of voting on the issue within that period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   If a valid petition is not filed, the question presented to the voters shall be on whether the alternate set forth in the board action shall be adopted. If a majority of the electors voting on the question vote in favor of the question, the optional unified form of county government set forth in the question shall be effective on January 1 following the certification of the election by the board of county canvassers.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   If a valid petition is filed, the questions presented to the voters shall be on whether to adopt an optional unified form of county government, and then whether to adopt alternate A or alternate B. If a majority of the electors voting on the question of whether to adopt an optional unified form of county government vote in favor of the question, the alternate receiving the highest number of votes shall prevail and shall be effective on January 1 following the certification of the election by the board of county canvassers. A county board of commissioners, by majority vote, may place both alternate A and alternate B on the ballot at the same time. The alternate receiving the highest number of votes by the electors shall prevail.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   If the question of adopting an optional unified form of county government is not approved, approval of either alternate is void and the subsequent adoption of an optional unified form of county government shall be pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   If the county board of commissioners does not adopt an optional unified form of county government, petitions bearing the signatures of registered electors of the county equal to not less than 10% of the total number of votes cast for governor in the county in the last previous election at which a governor was elected, may be filed with the county clerk requesting adoption of alternate A or alternate B. Two separate petitions or sets of petitions may be filed if each petition or set of petitions requests the adoption of a different alternate. Upon the clerk certifying to the county board of commissioners that a proper petition is filed, the question of adopting an optional unified form of county government with the alternate specified in the petition, or both alternates if 2 separate petitions or sets of petitions are filed and certified and each petition or set of petitions requests the adoption of a different alternate, shall be submitted by the board to the electorate of the county for approval or disapproval at the next regular primary election occurring not less than 90 days nor more than 180 days after the date the clerk certifies the petitions to the county board of commissioners. If a primary election is not scheduled during this period, the question shall be submitted at a special election called by the county board of commissioners for that purpose within this period. If a majority of the votes cast on the proposal approve the adoption, the optional unified form of county government containing the alternate specified in the original petition shall become effective in the county on January 1 after the date of the election. If both alternates are on the ballot and a majority of the votes cast on the proposal approve the adoption of an optional unified form of county government, the alternate receiving the highest number of votes shall prevail and shall become effective in the county on January 1 after the date of the election. If the question of adopting an optional unified form of county government is not approved, approval of either alternate is void and the subsequent adoption of an optional unified form of county government shall be pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An election held pursuant to this section shall be subject to and in accordance with the general election laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as otherwise provided by law, an election which is requested by a county board of commissioners or pursuant to petitions filed by the electors for purposes of implementing this act shall be paid by the county.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   This section shall not apply to a petition requesting adoption of an optional unified form of county government which received signatures before May 23, 1974, and the adoption of an optional unified form of county government by a county board of commissioners before May 23, 1974 shall not be construed as being invalid or to require further action.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A petition requesting adoption of an optional unified form of county government which received signatures before the effective date of this subsection or the adoption of an optional unified form of county government by a county board of commissioners before the effective date of this subsection shall not be construed as being invalid or to require any further action as a result of this act, and the optional unified form of county government requested by the petition or adopted by a county board of commissioners or both shall be placed on the ballot as provided in this act.</DIV>

The abolition then shall be submitted to the electorate of the county for approval or disapproval at the next regular primary or general election occurring within the county.

<P>Sec. 8.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Bonds issued under this act shall be authorized by a resolution or ordinance adopted by the county board of commissioners. The county board of commissioners may, by a majority vote of its members elect, pledge the full faith and credit of the county for the prompt payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds, including revenue bonds, issued pursuant to this act. If it becomes necessary for the county to advance money, other than its share of the cost of the project for the payment of principal and interest, then the county is entitled to reimbursement from any surplus from time to time existing in the fund from which the principal and interest are primarily payable. If the full faith and credit of the county are pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on any bonds issued pursuant to this act, the county may, in the case of insufficiency of funds primarily pledged for the payment, pay the principal and interest from its general fund or levy taxes, but not in excess of the rate or amount necessary to make up the deficiency and not in excess of, or contrary to, constitutional limitations.

<P>Sec. 9.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A county may contract with 1 or more public corporations, including the county itself, for the acquisition, improvement, enlargement, or extension of a solid waste system and for the payment of the cost of the system by the contracting public corporations, with interest, over a period not exceeding 40 years.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In a contract entered into under subsection (1), each contracting public corporation shall pledge its full faith and credit for the payment of its obligations under the contract. If the public corporation has taxing power, it may each year levy a tax in an amount that is sufficient for the prompt payment of all or part of the contract obligations due before the following year's tax collection. The contract is not subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821. If the contract or an unlimited tax pledge in support of the contract has been approved by the electors, the tax may be in addition to any tax that the public corporation otherwise may be authorized to levy and may be imposed without limitation as to rate or amount, but shall not be in excess of the rate or amount necessary to pay the contract obligation. For the payment of contractual obligations incurred pursuant to this section, a township shall levy a tax only on the taxable property of the township not incorporated as a village unless the township and a village have agreed that a part of the capacity in the county system allocated to the township by contract pursuant to this act will be used to serve areas in a village located wholly or partly within the township and the village has not itself agreed to purchase that capacity in the county system. If a contracting public corporation at the time of its annual tax levy has on hand in cash or has budgeted any amount pledged to the payment of the current obligations for which the tax levy is to be made, then the annual tax levy may be reduced by that amount. For the purpose of obtaining the credit, money may be raised by a public corporation by 1 or more of the following methods:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Service or availability charges to users or customers of the system in an amount no greater than that needed to pay the current operating costs of the system.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Special assessments upon lands benefited, directly or indirectly or at a present or future time.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Setting aside state collected money disbursed to the public corporation and usable for this purpose.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Setting aside other available money.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Money raised or to be raised by a public corporation by a method described in subsection (2) may be pledged to secure the payment of its obligations under a contract entered into under subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A public corporation may agree to raise all or any part of its contract obligation by a method provided in this section or by another legally available method. The governing body of a public corporation shall exercise the powers granted to the public corporation under this act.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 15.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A contract made under this act may provide that if a public corporation fails to pay to a county an amount required to be paid under the contract when due, then the county treasurer shall notify the state treasurer, or other appropriate disbursing official, who shall deduct the amount from money in the treasurer's possession belonging to the public corporation that is not pledged to the payment of debts.
