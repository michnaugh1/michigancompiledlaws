</P>
<P>Sec. 20g.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The department may establish a youth correctional facility which shall house only prisoners committed to the jurisdiction of the department who are 19 years of age or less. If the department establishes or contracts with a private vendor for the operation of a youth correctional facility, following intake processing in a department operated facility, the department shall house all male prisoners who are 16 years of age or less at the youth correctional facility unless the department determines that the prisoner should be housed at a different facility for reasons of security, safety, or because of the prisoner's specialized physical or mental health care needs. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as provided in subsection (3), a prisoner who is 16 years of age or less and housed at a youth correctional facility shall only be placed in a general population housing unit with prisoners who are 16 years of age or less.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A prisoner who becomes 17 years of age while being housed at a youth correctional facility and who has a satisfactory prison record may remain in a general population housing unit for no more than 1 year with prisoners who are 16 years of age or less.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Except as provided in subsection (3), a prisoner who is 16 years of age or less and housed at a youth correctional facility shall not be allowed to be in the proximity of a prisoner who is 17 years of age or more without the presence and direct supervision of custody personnel in the immediate vicinity.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The department may establish and operate the youth correctional facility or may contract on behalf of the state with a private vendor for the construction or operation, or both, of the youth correctional facility. If the department contracts with a private vendor to construct, rehabilitate, develop, renovate, or operate any existing or anticipated facility pursuant to this section, the department shall require a written certification from the private vendor regarding all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If practicable to efficiently and effectively complete the project, the private vendor shall follow a competitive bid process for the construction, rehabilitation, development, or renovation of the facility, and this process shall be open to all Michigan residents and firms. The private vendor shall not discriminate against any contractor on the basis of its affiliation or nonaffiliation with any collective bargaining organization.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The private vendor shall make a good faith effort to employ, if qualified, Michigan residents at the facility.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The private vendor shall make a good faith effort to employ or contract with Michigan residents and firms to construct, rehabilitate, develop, or renovate the facility.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If the department contracts with a private vendor for the operation of the youth correctional facility, the department shall require by contract that the personnel employed by the private vendor in the operation of the facility be certified as correctional officers to the same extent as would be required if those personnel were employed in a correctional facility operated by the department. The department also shall require by contract that the private vendor meet requirements specified by the department regarding security, protection of the public, inspections by the department, programming, liability and insurance, conditions of confinement, educational services required under subsection (11), and any other issues the department considers necessary for the operation of the youth correctional facility. The department shall also require that the contract include provisions to protect the public's interest if the private vendor defaults on the contract. Before finalizing a contract with a private vendor for the construction or operation of the youth correctional facility, the department shall submit the proposed contract to the standing committees of the senate and the house of representatives having jurisdiction of corrections issues, the corrections subcommittees of the standing committees on appropriations of the senate and the house of representatives, and, with regard to proposed construction contracts, the joint committee on capital outlay. A contract between the department and a private vendor for the construction or operation of the youth correctional facility shall be contingent upon appropriation of the required funding. If the department contracts with a private vendor under this section, the selection of that private vendor shall be by open, competitive bid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The department shall not site a youth correctional facility under this section in a city, village, or township unless the local legislative body of that city, village, or township adopts a resolution approving the location.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   A private vendor operating a youth correctional facility under a contract under this section shall not do any of the following, unless directed to do so by the department policy:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Calculate inmate release and parole eligibility dates.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Award good time or disciplinary credits, or impose disciplinary time.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Approve inmates for extensions of limits of confinement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   The youth correctional facility shall be open to visits during all business hours, and during nonbusiness hours unless an emergency prevents it, by any elected state senator or state representative.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   Once each year, the department shall report on the operation of the facility. Copies of the report shall be submitted to the chairpersons of the house and senate committees responsible for legislation on corrections or judicial issues, and to the clerk of the house of representatives and the secretary of the senate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   Regardless of whether the department itself operates the youth correctional facility or contracts with a private vendor to operate the youth correctional facility, all of the following educational services shall be provided for juvenile prisoners housed at the facility who have not earned a high school diploma or received a general education certificate (GED):</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The department or private vendor shall require that a prisoner whose academic achievement level is not sufficient to allow the prisoner to participate effectively in a program leading to the attainment of a GED certificate participate in classes that will prepare him or her to participate effectively in the GED program, and shall provide those classes in the facility.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The department or private vendor shall require that a prisoner who successfully completes classes described in subdivision (a), or whose academic achievement level is otherwise sufficient, participate in classes leading to the attainment of a GED certificate, and shall provide those classes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   Neither the department nor the private vendor shall seek to have the youth correctional facility authorized as a public school academy under the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1 to 380.1852.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   A private vendor that operates the youth correctional facility under a contract with the department shall provide written notice of its intention to discontinue its operation of the facility. This subsection does not authorize or limit liability for a breach or default of contract. If the reason for the discontinuance is that the private vendor intends not to renew the contract, the notice shall be delivered to the director of the department at least 1 year before the contract expiration date. If the discontinuance is for any other reason, the notice shall be delivered to the director of the department at least 6 months before the date on which the private vendor will discontinue its operation of the facility.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The grant of a parole is subject to all of the following conditions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A prisoner must not be given liberty on parole until the board has reasonable assurance, after consideration of all of the facts and circumstances, including the prisoner's mental and social attitude, that the prisoner will not become a menace to society or to the public safety.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Except as provided in section 34a and section 35(10), a parole must not be granted to a prisoner other than a prisoner subject to disciplinary time until the prisoner has served the minimum term imposed by the court less allowances for good time or special good time to which the prisoner may be entitled by statute, except that a prisoner other than a prisoner subject to disciplinary time is eligible for parole before the expiration of his or her minimum term of imprisonment if the sentencing judge, or the judge's successor in office, gives written approval of the parole of the prisoner before the expiration of the minimum term of imprisonment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Except as provided in section 34a and section 35(10), and notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (b), a parole must not be granted to a prisoner other than a prisoner subject to disciplinary time sentenced for the commission of a crime described in section 33b(a) to (cc) until the prisoner has served the minimum term imposed by the court less an allowance for disciplinary credits as provided in section 33(5) of 1893 PA 118, MCL 800.33. A prisoner described in this subdivision is not eligible for special parole.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Except as provided in section 34a and section 35(10), a parole must not be granted to a prisoner subject to disciplinary time until the prisoner has served the minimum term imposed by the court. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A prisoner must not be released on parole until the parole board has satisfactory evidence that arrangements have been made for such honorable and useful employment as the prisoner is capable of performing, for the prisoner's education, or for the prisoner's care if the prisoner is mentally or physically ill or incapacitated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Except as provided in section 35(10), a prisoner whose minimum term of imprisonment is 2 years or more must not be released on parole unless he or she has either earned a high school diploma or a high school equivalency certificate. The director of the department may waive the restriction imposed by this subdivision as to any prisoner who is over the age of 65 or who was gainfully employed immediately before committing the crime for which he or she was incarcerated. The department may also waive the restriction imposed by this subdivision as to any prisoner who has a learning disability, who does not have the necessary proficiency in English, or who for some other reason that is not the fault of the prisoner is unable to successfully complete the requirements for a high school diploma or a high school equivalency certificate. If the prisoner does not have the necessary proficiency in English, the department shall provide English language training for that prisoner necessary for the prisoner to begin working toward the completion of the requirements for a high school equivalency certificate. This subdivision applies to prisoners sentenced for crimes committed after December 15, 1998. In providing an educational program leading to a high school diploma or a high school equivalency certificate, the department shall give priority to prisoners sentenced for crimes committed on or before December 15, 1998.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Paroles-in-custody to answer warrants filed by local or out-of-state agencies, or immigration officials, are permissible if an accredited agent of the agency filing the warrant calls for the prisoner to be paroled in custody.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The parole board may promulgate rules under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, that are not inconsistent with this act with respect to conditions imposed upon prisoners paroled under this act.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>791.233e Parole guidelines; rules; reasons for departure from guidelines; waiver for subsequent review; report.</B><P>Sec. 33e.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The department shall develop parole guidelines that are consistent with section 33(1)(a) to govern the exercise of the parole board's discretion under sections 34 and 35 as to the release of prisoners on parole under this act. The purpose of the parole guidelines is to assist the parole board in making objective, evidence-based release decisions that enhance the public safety.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In developing the parole guidelines, the department shall consider factors including, but not limited to, the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The offense for which the prisoner is incarcerated at the time of parole consideration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The prisoner's institutional program performance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The prisoner's institutional conduct.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The prisoner's prior criminal record. As used in this subdivision, "prior criminal record" means the recorded criminal history of a prisoner, including all misdemeanor and felony convictions, probation violations, juvenile adjudications for acts that would have been crimes if committed by an adult, parole failures, and delayed sentences.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Other relevant factors as determined by the department, if not otherwise prohibited by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In developing the parole guidelines, the department may consider both of the following factors:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The prisoner's statistical risk screening.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The prisoner's age.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The department shall ensure that the parole guidelines do not create disparities in release decisions based on race, color, national origin, gender, religion, or disability.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The department shall promulgate rules under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, that prescribe the parole guidelines.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The parole board may depart from the parole guidelines by denying parole to a prisoner who has a high probability of parole as determined under the parole guidelines or by granting parole to a prisoner who has a low probability of parole as determined under the parole guidelines. A departure under this subsection must be for substantial and compelling objective reasons stated in writing. The parole board shall not use a prisoner's gender, race, ethnicity, alienage, national origin, or religion to depart from the recommended parole guidelines.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Substantial and compelling objective reasons for a departure from the parole guidelines for a prisoner with high probability of parole are limited to the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The prisoner exhibits a pattern of ongoing behavior while incarcerated indicating that he or she would be a substantial risk to public safety, including major misconducts or additional criminal convictions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The prisoner refuses to participate in programming ordered by the department to reduce the prisoner's risk. A prisoner may not be considered to have refused programming if unable to complete programming due to factors beyond his or her control.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) There is verified objective evidence of substantial harm to a victim that could not have been available for consideration at the time of sentencing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The prisoner has threatened harm to another person if released.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) There is objective evidence of post-sentencing conduct, not already scored under the parole guidelines, that the prisoner would present a high risk to public safety if paroled.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The prisoner is a suspect in an unsolved criminal case that is being actively investigated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The prisoner has a pending felony charge or is subject to a detainer request from another jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The prisoner has not yet completed programming ordered by the department to reduce the prisoner's risk, and the programming is not available in the community and the risk cannot be adequately managed in the community before completion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The release of the prisoner is otherwise barred by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) The prisoner fails to present a sufficient parole plan adequately addressing his or her identified risks and needs to ensure that he or she will not present a risk to public safety if released on parole. If a prisoner is denied parole under this subdivision, the parole board must provide the prisoner a detailed explanation of the deficiencies in the parole plan so that the prisoner may address the deficiencies before his or her next review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) The prisoner has received a psychological evaluation in the past 3 years indicating the prisoner would present a high risk to public safety if paroled.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The parole board may deny parole for up to 1 year to a prisoner who was denied parole under subsection (7)(h) to allow for the completion of programming ordered by the department. A prisoner denied parole under subsection (7)(h) must receive parole consideration within 30 days after the completion of the programming.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Unless a waiver is issued under subsection (10), the parole board shall conduct a review of a prisoner, except for a prisoner serving a life sentence, who has been denied parole as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the prisoner scored high or average probability of parole, not less than annually.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the prisoner scored low probability of parole, not less than every 2 years until a score of high or average probability of parole is attained.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The parole board may conduct a subsequent review of a prisoner, except for a prisoner serving a life sentence, not more than 5 years after the review denying the prisoner parole, if a majority of the parole board agrees to and signs a written recommendation to waive the requirements under subsection (9). A waiver under this subsection may be issued only if a majority of the parole board finds and includes a statement in the waiver that all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The parole board had no interest in granting the prisoner parole in the review denying the prisoner parole. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The parole review requirements under subsection (9) would cause additional harm to a victim of a crime for which the prisoner was committed, or to the victim's surviving family members.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The harm described under subdivision (b) can be mitigated only by waiving the parole review process under subsection (9).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Unique circumstances and factors contributed to the decision to deny the prisoner parole and to waive the parole review process under subsection (9).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Not less than once every 2 years, the department shall review the correlation between the implementation of the parole guidelines and the recidivism rate of paroled prisoners, and shall submit to the joint committee on administrative rules any proposed revisions to the administrative rules that the department considers appropriate after conducting the review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) By March 1 of each year, the department shall report to the standing committees of the senate and the house of representatives having jurisdiction of corrections issues all of the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The number of prisoners who scored high probability of parole and were granted parole during the preceding calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The number of prisoners who scored high probability of parole and for whom parole was deferred to complete necessary programming during the preceding calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The number of prisoners who scored high probability of parole and were incarcerated at least 6 months past their first parole eligibility date as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The number of prisoners who scored high probability of parole and were denied parole for a substantial and compelling objective reason, or substantial and compelling objective reasons, under subsection (7) during the preceding calendar year. This information must be provided with a breakdown of parole denials for each of the substantial and compelling objective reasons under subsection (7).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The number of prisoners who scored high probability of parole and were denied parole whose controlling offense is in each of the following groups:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Homicide.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Sexual offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) An assaultive offense other than a homicide or sexual offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) A nonassaultive offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) A controlled substance offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Of the total number of prisoners subject to subsection (7) who scored high probability of parole and were denied parole, the number who have served the following amount of time after completing their minimum sentence:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Less than 1 year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) One year or more but less than 2 years.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Four or more years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The number of prisoners issued a waiver under subsection (10).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The department shall immediately advise the standing committees of the senate and house of representatives having jurisdiction of corrections issues of any changes made to the scoring of the parole guidelines after December 12, 2018, including a change in the number of points that define "high probability of parole".</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) Subsections (6), (7), and (8), as amended or added by 2018 PA 339, apply only to prisoners whose controlling offense was committed on or after December 12, 2018. Subsections (7) and (8) do not apply to a prisoner serving a life sentence, regardless of the date of his or her controlling offense.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A parole granted to a prisoner under subsection (7) is subject to the following conditions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) At the conclusion of 10 calendar years of the prisoner's sentence and thereafter as determined by the parole board until the prisoner is paroled, discharged, or deceased, and in accordance with the procedures described in subsection (9), 1 member of the parole board shall interview the prisoner. The interview schedule prescribed in this subdivision applies to all prisoners to whom subsection (7) applies, regardless of the date on which they were sentenced.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) In addition to the interview schedule prescribed in subdivision (a), the parole board shall review the prisoner's file at the conclusion of 15 calendar years of the prisoner's sentence and every 5 years thereafter until the prisoner is paroled, discharged, or deceased. A prisoner whose file is to be reviewed under this subdivision must be notified of the upcoming file review at least 30 days before the file review takes place and must be allowed to submit written statements or documentary evidence for the parole board's consideration in conducting the file review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A decision to grant or deny parole to the prisoner must not be made until after a public hearing held in the manner prescribed for pardons and commutations in sections 44 and 45. Notice of the public hearing must be given to the sentencing judge, or the judge's successor in office. Parole must not be granted if the sentencing judge files written objections to the granting of the parole within 30 days of receipt of the notice of hearing, but the sentencing judge's written objections bar the granting of parole only if the sentencing judge is still in office in the court before which the prisoner was convicted and sentenced. A sentencing judge's successor in office may file written objections to the granting of parole, but a successor judge's objections must not bar the granting of parole under subsection (7).

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A parole granted under subsection (7) must be for a period of not less than 4 years and subject to the usual rules pertaining to paroles granted by the parole board.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The prisoner must be given written notice, not less than 30 days before the interview date, stating that the interview will be conducted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The prisoner may be represented at the interview by an individual of his or her choice. The representative must not be another prisoner. A prisoner is not entitled to appointed counsel at public expense. The prisoner or representative may present relevant evidence in favor of holding a public hearing as allowed in subsection (8)(c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) In determining whether a prisoner convicted of violating, or attempting or conspiring to violate, section 7401(2)(a)(i) of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7401, and sentenced to imprisonment for life before October 1, 1998 is to be released on parole, the parole board shall consider all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Whether the violation was part of a continuing series of violations of section 7401 or 7403 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7401 and 333.7403, by that individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Whether the violation was committed by the individual in concert with 5 or more other individuals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Whether the individual was a principal administrator, organizer, or leader of an entity that the individual knew or had reason to know was organized, in whole or in part, to commit violations of section 7401 or 7403 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7401 and 333.7403, and whether the violation for which the individual was convicted was committed to further the interests of that entity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Whether the individual was a principal administrator, organizer, or leader of an entity that the individual knew or had reason to know committed violations of section 7401 or 7403 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7401 and 333.7403, and whether the violation for which the individual was convicted was committed to further the interests of that entity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Whether the violation was committed in a drug-free school zone.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Whether the violation involved the delivery of a controlled substance to an individual less than 17 years of age or possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance to an individual less than 17 years of age.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Except as provided in subsection (19) and section 34a, a prisoner's release on parole is discretionary with the parole board. The action of the parole board in granting a parole is appealable by the prosecutor of the county from which the prisoner was committed or the victim of the crime for which the prisoner was convicted.

Aug. 21, 2019 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> A mandatory sentence of life without parole does not violate the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, because the Eighth Amendment contains no proportionality guarantee. Neither does the Eighth Amendment prohibit the imposition of mandatory sentences -- “severe, mandatory penalties may be cruel, but they are not unusual in the constitutional sense ... ” -- nor does it require consideration of individualized, mitigating circumstances beyond those cases in which a capital sentence is imposed. Harmelin v Michigan, 501 US 957; 111 S Ct 2680; 115 L Ed2d 836 (1991).In People v Bullock, 440 Mich 15; 485 NW2d 866 (1992), the Michigan Supreme Court held that the Michigan Constitution prohibits cruel or unusual punishment while the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution bars only punishment that is both cruel and unusual. Basing its decision on the textual difference, the Michigan Supreme Court held that the statutory penalty of mandatory life in prison without parole for possession of 650 grams or more of any mixture containing cocaine is so grossly disproportionate as to be cruel or unusual, the result being that those portions of the statutes denying parole consideration are struck down.<BR><B>Popular Name:</B> Department of Corrections Act</p>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The release of a prisoner on parole must be granted solely upon the initiative of the parole board. There is no entitlement to parole. The parole board may grant a parole without interviewing the prisoner if, after evaluating the prisoner according to the parole guidelines, the parole board determines that the prisoner has a high probability of being paroled and the parole board therefore intends to parole the prisoner. Except as provided in subsection (2), a prisoner must not be denied parole without an interview before 1 member of the parole board. The interview must be conducted at least 1 month before the expiration of the prisoner's minimum sentence less applicable good time and disciplinary credits for a prisoner eligible for good time and disciplinary credits, or at least 1 month before the expiration of the prisoner's minimum sentence for a prisoner subject to disciplinary time. The parole board shall consider any statement made to the parole board by a crime victim under the William Van Regenmorter crime victim's rights act, 1985 PA 87, MCL 780.751 to 780.834, or under any other provision of law. The parole board shall not consider any of the following factors in making a parole determination:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A juvenile record that a court has ordered the department to expunge.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Information that is determined by the parole board to be inaccurate or irrelevant after a challenge and presentation of relevant evidence by a prisoner who has received a notice of intent to conduct an interview as provided in subsection (4). This subdivision applies only to presentence investigation reports prepared before April 1, 1983.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If, after evaluating a prisoner according to the parole guidelines, the parole board determines that the prisoner has a low probability of being paroled and the parole board therefore does not intend to parole the prisoner, the parole board is not required to interview the prisoner before denying parole to the prisoner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The parole board may consider but shall not base a determination to deny parole solely on either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A prisoner's marital history.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Prior arrests not resulting in conviction or adjudication of delinquency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If an interview is to be conducted, the prisoner must be sent a notice of intent to conduct an interview not less than 1 month before the date of the interview. The notice must state the specific issues and concerns that will be discussed at the interview and that may be a basis for a denial of parole. The parole board shall not deny parole based on reasons other than those stated in the notice of intent to conduct an interview except for good cause stated to the prisoner at or before the interview and in the written explanation required by subsection (20). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except for good cause, the parole board member conducting the interview shall not have cast a vote for or against the prisoner's release before conducting the current interview. Before the interview, the parole board member who is to conduct the interview shall review pertinent information relative to the notice of intent to conduct an interview.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A prisoner may waive the right to an interview by 1 member of the parole board. The waiver of the right to be interviewed must be in writing and given not more than 30 days after the notice of intent to conduct an interview is issued. During the interview held under a notice of intent to conduct an interview, the prisoner may be represented by an individual of his or her choice. The representative shall not be another prisoner or an attorney. A prisoner is not entitled to appointed counsel at public expense. The prisoner or representative may present relevant evidence in support of release. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) At least 90 days before the expiration of the prisoner's minimum sentence less applicable good time and disciplinary credits for a prisoner eligible for good time or disciplinary credits, or at least 90 days before the expiration of the prisoner's minimum sentence for a prisoner subject to disciplinary time, or the expiration of a 12-month continuance for any prisoner, or at the request of the parole board for a prisoner being considered for parole under subsection (10), the appropriate institutional staff shall prepare a parole eligibility report. The parole eligibility report is considered pertinent information for purposes of subsection (5). The report must include all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A statement of all major misconduct charges of which the prisoner was found guilty and the punishment served for the misconduct.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The prisoner's work and educational record while confined.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The results of any physical, mental, or psychiatric examinations of the prisoner that may have been performed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Whether the prisoner fully cooperated with this state by providing complete financial information as required under section 3a of the state correctional facility reimbursement act, 1935 PA 253, MCL 800.403a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Whether the prisoner refused to attempt to obtain identification documents under section 34c, if applicable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) For a prisoner subject to disciplinary time, a statement of all disciplinary time submitted for the parole board's consideration under section 34 of 1893 PA 118, MCL 800.34.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The result on any validated risk assessment instrument.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The preparer of the report shall not include a recommendation as to release on parole.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Psychological evaluations performed at the request of the parole board to assist it in reaching a decision on the release of a prisoner may be performed by the same person who provided the prisoner with therapeutic treatment, unless a different person is requested by the prisoner or parole board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Except for a prisoner who was convicted of any crime that is punishable by a term of life imprisonment without parole or of a violation of section 520b of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.520b, the parole board may grant a medical parole for a prisoner determined to be medically frail. A decision to grant a medical parole must be initiated on the recommendation of the bureau of health care services. If the bureau of health care services believes that the prisoner is medically frail, the bureau shall utilize a specialist in the appropriate field of medicine, who is not employed by the department, to evaluate the condition of the prisoner and to report on that condition to the bureau. The parole board, in consultation with the bureau of health care services, shall determine whether the prisoner is medically frail. If the parole board determines that a prisoner is medically frail and is going to be considered for parole under this subsection, the parole board shall provide the notice and medical records required under section 34(18). Unless the prosecutor of the county from which the prisoner was committed files a motion under section 34(19), the parole board may grant parole to a prisoner who is determined to be medically frail. If a motion is filed under section 34(19) and the court finds that the prisoner is eligible for parole as a result of being medically frail, and if no additional appeals are pending, the parole board may grant parole to the prisoner under this subsection. The requirements of sections 33(1)(b), (c), (d), and (f), 33b, and 34(1), (2), (3), (4), (7), (13), (14), (15), (16), and (17) do not apply to a parole granted under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The following conditions apply to a parole granted under subsection (10):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A prisoner must only be released on parole under subsection (10) if he or she agrees to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) His or her placement, or, if the parolee is unable to consent because of the parolee's physical or mental health condition, an individual legally entitled to agree to the parolee's placement agrees that the parolee be placed, in a medical facility approved by the parole board where medical care and treatment can be provided.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) To the release of his or her medical records that are directly relevant to the condition or conditions rendering the prisoner medically frail to the prosecutor and sentencing or successor judge of the county from which the prisoner was committed before the parole board determines whether or not to grant the prisoner parole under subsection (10).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) An independent medical exam if sought by the prosecutor of the county from which the prisoner was committed as provided under section 34(19). If possible, this independent medical exam must occur at a facility of the department. The reasonable costs of this independent medical exam must be paid for by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The parolee shall adhere to the terms of his or her parole for the length of his or her parole term.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The parole must be for a term not less than the time necessary to reach the prisoner's earliest release date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A parolee who violates the terms of his or her parole or is determined to no longer meet the definition of medically frail may be transferred to a setting more appropriate for the medical needs of the parolee or be subject to the parole violation process under sections 38, 39, 39a, and 40a as determined by the parole board and the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The parolee must only be placed in a medical facility that agrees to accept the parolee and that is agreed upon by the parolee as described in subdivision (a)(i).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The parolee or an individual legally entitled to agree to the parolee's placement under subsection (11)(a)(i), other than the medical facility, shall immediately inform the parole board if any of the following occur:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The parolee is no longer eligible for care at the medical facility at which he or she was placed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The parolee must be moved to another location for medical care.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The parolee is no longer at the medical facility approved by the parole board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The parolee no longer needs the level of care that resulted in the parolee's placement at the medical facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The parole board shall immediately notify the prosecutor for the county in which the offender was convicted and the sentencing or successor judge if the parolee is no longer eligible for care or no longer needs the level of care for which the prisoner was placed at the medical facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) The department shall not retain authority over the medical treatment plan for a prisoner granted parole under subsection (10) and a prisoner granted parole under subsection (10) must have full patient rights at the medical facility where he or she is placed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) The department and the parole board shall ensure that the placement and terms and conditions of a parole granted under subsection (10) do not violate any other state or federal regulations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) A medical facility housing parolees granted parole under subsection (10) must be operated in a manner that ensures the safety of the residents of the medical facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) A parolee granted parole under subsection (10) and placed in a medical facility has the same patient rights and responsibilities as any other individual who is a resident of or has been admitted to the medical facility. The medical facility is not responsible for the enforcement of conditions of parole or the reporting of violations of conditions of parole for any parolee placed in the medical facility. The medical facility shall comply with state and federal laws and regulations that protect resident rights and state and federal laws and regulations for skilled nursing facilities, regardless of the conditions of parole imposed on a resident parolee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) The process for a parole determination under subsection (10) does not change or affect any of the rights afforded to a victim under the William Van Regenmorter crime victim's rights act, 1985 PA 87, MCL 780.751 to 780.834.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) The department shall file a petition to the appropriate court under section 434 of the mental health code, 1974 PA 258, MCL 330.1434, for any prisoner being paroled or being released after serving his or her maximum sentence whom the department considers to be a person requiring treatment. The parole board shall require mental health treatment as a special condition of parole for any parolee whom the department has determined to be a person requiring treatment whether or not the petition filed for that prisoner is granted by the court. As used in this subsection, "person requiring treatment" means that term as defined in section 401 of the mental health code, 1974 PA 258, MCL 330.1401.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) When the parole board makes a final determination not to release a prisoner, the parole board shall provide the prisoner with a written explanation of the reason for denial and, if appropriate, specific recommendations for corrective action the prisoner may take to facilitate release.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If a prisoner convicted of violating or conspiring to violate section 7401(2)(a)(i) or (ii) or 7403(2)(a)(i) or (ii) of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7401 and 333.7403, is released on parole, the parole order must contain a notice that if the parolee violates or conspires to violate article 7 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7101 to 333.7545, and that violation or conspiracy to violate is punishable by imprisonment for 4 or more years, or commits a violent felony during his or her release on parole, parole must be revoked.</div>

If the parole officer determines that restitution is not being paid as ordered, the parole officer shall file a written report of the violation with the parole board on a form prescribed by the parole board. The report must include a statement of the amount of arrearage and any reasons for the arrearage known by the parole officer. The parole board shall immediately provide a copy of the report to the court, the prosecuting attorney, and the victim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) If a parolee is required to register under the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.721 to 28.736, the parole officer shall register the parolee as provided in that act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) If a parolee convicted of violating or conspiring to violate section 520b or 520c of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.520b and 750.520c, other than a parolee who is subject to lifetime electronic monitoring under section 85, is placed on parole, the parole board may require that the parolee be subject to electronic monitoring. The electronic monitoring required under this subsection must be conducted in the same manner, and is subject to the same requirements, as is described in section 520n(2) of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.520n, and section 85, except as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The electronic monitoring shall continue only for the duration of the term of parole.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A violation by the parolee of any requirement prescribed in section 520n(2) is a violation of a condition of parole, not a felony violation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) If the parole order contains a condition intended to protect 1 or more named persons, the department shall enter those provisions of the parole order into the corrections management information system, accessible by the law enforcement information network. If the parole board rescinds a parole order described in this subsection, the department within 3 business days shall remove from the corrections management information system the provisions of that parole order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) Each prisoner who is required to be registered under the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.721 to 28.736, before being released on parole or being released upon completion of his or her maximum sentence, shall provide to the department notice of the location of his or her proposed place of residence or domicile. The department then shall forward that notice of location to the appropriate law enforcement agency as required under section 5(3) of the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.725. A prisoner who refuses to provide notice of the location of his or her proposed place of residence or domicile or knowingly provides an incorrect notice of the location of his or her proposed place of residence or domicile under this subsection is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 4 years or a fine of not more than $2,000.00, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) If a prisoner is serving a sentence for violating section 411i of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.411i, and if a victim of that crime has registered to receive notices about that prisoner under the William Van Regenmorter crime victim's rights act, 1985 PA 87, MCL 780.751 to 780.834, the parole order for that prisoner must require that the prisoner's location be monitored by a global positioning monitoring system during the entire period of the prisoner's parole. If, at the time a prisoner described in this subsection is paroled, no victim of the crime has registered to receive notices about that prisoner under the William Van Regenmorter crime victim's rights act, 1985 PA 87, MCL 780.751 to 780.834, but a victim of the crime subsequently registers to receive those notices, the prisoner's order of parole must immediately be modified to require that the prisoner's location be monitored by a global positioning system during the balance of the period of that prisoner's parole. As used in this subsection, "global positioning monitoring system" means a system that electronically determines and reports the location of an individual by means of an ankle bracelet transmitter or similar device worn by the individual, which transmits latitude and longitude data to monitoring authorities through global positioning satellite technology but does not include any radio frequency identification technology, global positioning technology, or similar technology that would be implanted in the parolee or would otherwise violate the corporeal body of the parolee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) The parole order must require the parolee to provide written consent to submit to a search of his or her person or property upon demand by a peace officer or parole officer. The written consent must include the prisoner's name and date of birth, his or her physical description, the date for release on parole, and the ending date for that parole. The prisoner shall sign the written consent before being released on parole. The department shall promptly enter this condition of parole into the department's corrections management information system or offender management network information system or into a corresponding records management system that is accessible through the law enforcement information network. Consent to a search as provided under this subsection does not authorize a search that is conducted with the sole intent to intimidate or harass.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) As used in this section, "violent felony" means an offense against a person in violation of section 82, 83, 84, 86, 87, 88, 89, 316, 317, 321, 349, 349a, 350, 397, 520b, 520c, 520d, 520e, 520g, 529, 529a, or 530 of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.82, 750.83, 750.84, 750.86, 750.87, 750.88, 750.89, 750.316, 750.317, 750.321, 750.349, 750.349a, 750.350, 750.397, 750.520b, 750.520c, 750.520d, 750.520e, 750.520g, 750.529, 750.529a, and 750.530.</div>

<P>Sec. 52.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The following procedures shall apply to each prisoner hearing conducted pursuant to section 51(2):</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The parties shall be given an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing without undue delay.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The parties shall be given reasonable notice of the hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If a party fails to appear at a hearing after proper service of notice, the hearings officer, if an adjournment is not granted, may proceed with the hearing and make a decision in the absence of the party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Each party shall be given an opportunity to present evidence and oral and written arguments on issues of fact.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   A prisoner may not cross-examine a witness, but may submit rebuttal evidence. A prisoner may also submit written questions to the hearings officer to be asked of a witness or witnesses. The hearings officer may present these questions to and receive answers from the witness or witnesses. The questions presented and the evidence received in response to these questions shall become a part of the record. A hearings officer may refuse to present the prisoner's questions to the witness or witnesses. If the hearings officer does not present the questions to the witness or witnesses, the reason for the decision not to present the questions shall be entered into the record.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The hearings officer may administer an oath or affirmation to a witness in a matter before the officer, certify to official acts, and take depositions.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   The hearings officer may admit and give probative effect to evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded. The reason for the exclusion of the evidence shall be entered into the record. An objection to an offer of evidence may be made and shall be noted in the record. The hearings officer, for the purpose of expediting a hearing and if the interest of the parties are not substantially prejudiced by the action, may provide for the submission of all or part of the evidence in written form.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   Evidence, including records and documents in possession of the department of which the hearings officer wishes to avail himself or herself, shall be offered and made a part of the record. A hearings officer may deny access to the evidence to a party if the hearings officer determines that access may be dangerous to a witness or disruptive of normal prison operations. The reason for the denial shall be entered into the record.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The hearings conducted under this chapter shall be conducted in an impartial manner. On the filing in good faith by a party of a timely and sufficient affidavit of personal bias or disqualification of a hearings officer, the department shall determine the matter as a part of the record of the hearing, and the determination shall be subject to judicial review at the conclusion of the hearing. If a hearings officer is disqualified or it is impracticable for the hearings officer to continue the hearing, another hearings officer may be assigned to continue the hearing unless it is shown that substantial prejudice to a party will result from the continuation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)   Except as otherwise authorized by subdivision (e), a hearings officer, after the notice of the hearing is given, shall not communicate, directly or indirectly, in connection with an issue of fact, with a person or party, except on notice and opportunity for all parties to participate. A hearings officer may communicate with other members of the department and may have the aid and advice of department employees other than employees which have been or are engaged in investigating or prosecuting functions in connection with the hearing or a factually related matter which may be the subject of a hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(k)   A final decision or order of a hearings officer in a hearing shall be made, within a reasonable period, in writing or stated in the record and shall include findings of fact, and shall state any sanction to be imposed against a prisoner as a direct result of a hearing conducted under this chapter. The final decision shall be made on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence presented. Findings of fact shall be based exclusively on the evidence and on matters officially noticed. Findings of fact, if set forth in statutory language, shall be accompanied by a concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting them. A decision or order shall not be made except upon consideration of the record as a whole or a portion of the record as may be cited by a party to the proceeding and as supported by and pursuant to competent, material, and substantial evidence. A copy of the decision or order shall be delivered or mailed immediately to the prisoner. The final disposition shall be posted for the information of the reporting officer.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) File a copy of the modified conditions with the department.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, Article V, Section 2, of the Constitution of the State of Michigan of 1963, empowers the Governor to make changes in the organization of the Executive Branch or in the assignment of functions among its units which he considers necessary for efficient administration; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, Act No. 511 of the Public Acts of 1988 ("Act No. 511"), the Community Corrections Act, created an Office of Community Alternatives as an autonomous entity within the Department of Corrections; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, the purpose of Act No. 511 is to fund qualifying community corrections alternative programs that reduce state prison commitments by encouraging participation of offenders likely to be sentenced to imprisonment in a state correctional facility or jail, who would not increase the risk to public safety, have not demonstrated a pattern of violent behavior, and do not have a criminal record that indicates a pattern of violent offenses; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, Act No. 511 expressly requires that continued funding shall be contingent upon substantial compliance with this objective; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, Sec. 1006 of Enrolled House Bill 4418, the FY 1996 appropriations bill for the Department of Corrections, for the first time affords the Office of Community Alternatives (Corrections) express authority to approve use of its funds for the construction of facilities, which are to be minimum security facilities; it is essential that such decisions be integrated into and coordinated with comprehensive facilities planning for the Department of Corrections; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, this goal can be achieved only by coordination of corrections and corrections alternative policies; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, it is necessary in the interests of efficient administration and effectiveness of government to effect changes in the organization of the Executive Branch of government.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>NOW, THEREFORE, I, John Engler, Governor of the State of Michigan, pursuant to the powers vested in me by the Constitution of the State of Michigan of 1963, and the laws of the State of Michigan, do hereby order the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>2. The Director of the Department of Corrections may appoint the Executive Director of the Office of Community Alternatives or may administer the assigned functions in other ways to promote efficient administration.</div>

The assigned functions shall be administered under the direction and supervision of the Director, and all prescribed functions of rule-making, licensing and registration, including the prescription of rules, regulations, standards and adjudications, shall be transferred to the Director of the Department of Corrections.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>4. All records, personnel, property and unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations and other funds used, held, employed, available or to be made available to the Office of Community Alternatives for the activities transferred to the Department of Corrections by this Order are hereby transferred to the Department of Corrections.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>5. The Director of the Department of Corrections shall make internal organizational changes as may be administratively necessary to complete the realignment of responsibilities prescribed by this Order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>6. The Executive Director of the Office of Community Alternatives and the Director of the Department of Corrections shall immediately initiate coordination to facilitate the transfer and develop a memorandum of record identifying any pending settlements, issues of compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, or other obligations to be resolved by the Office of Community Alternatives.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>7. All rules, orders, contracts and agreements relating to the assigned functions lawfully adopted prior to the effective date of this Order shall continue to be effective until revised, amended or repealed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>8. Any suit, action or other proceeding lawfully commenced by or against any entity affected by this Order shall not abate by reason of the taking effect of this Order. Any suit, action or other proceeding may be maintained by or against the appropriate successor of any entity affected by this Order.</div>
