<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Each governmental agency having jurisdiction over a highway shall maintain the highway in reasonable repair so that it is reasonably safe and convenient for public travel. A person who sustains bodily injury or damage to his or her property by reason of failure of a governmental agency to keep a highway under its jurisdiction in reasonable repair and in a condition reasonably safe and fit for travel may recover the damages suffered by him or her from the governmental agency. The liability, procedure, and remedy as to county roads under the jurisdiction of a county road commission shall be as provided in section 21 of chapter IV of 1909 PA 283, MCL 224.21. Except as provided in section 2a, the duty of a governmental agency to repair and maintain highways, and the liability for that duty, extends only to the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel and does not include sidewalks, trailways, crosswalks, or any other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.

The state transportation department has the same defenses to the action as it would have had if the work had been performed by its own employees. If an action described in this subsection could have been maintained against the state transportation department, it shall not be maintained against the governmental agency that performed the work for the state transportation department. The governmental agency also has the same defenses that could have been asserted by the state transportation department had the action been brought against the state transportation department.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 17.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   To afford property owners, individuals, and governmental agencies greater efficiency, certainty, and consistency in the provision of relief for damages or physical injuries caused by a sewage disposal system event, a claimant and a governmental agency subject to a claim shall comply with this section and the procedures in sections 18 and 19.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A governmental agency is immune from tort liability for the overflow or backup of a sewage disposal system unless the overflow or backup is a sewage disposal system event and the governmental agency is an appropriate governmental agency. Sections 16 to 19 abrogate common law exceptions, if any, to immunity for the overflow or backup of a sewage disposal system and provide the sole remedy for obtaining any form of relief for damages or physical injuries caused by a sewage disposal system event regardless of the legal theory.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a claimant, including a claimant seeking noneconomic damages, believes that an event caused property damage or physical injury, the claimant may seek compensation for the property damage or physical injury from a governmental agency if the claimant shows that all of the following existed at the time of the event:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The sewage disposal system had a defect.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The governmental agency, having the legal authority to do so, failed to take reasonable steps in a reasonable amount of time to repair, correct, or remedy the defect.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The defect was a substantial proximate cause of the event and the property damage or physical injury.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In addition to the requirements of subsection (3), to obtain compensation for property damage or physical injury from a governmental agency, a claimant must show both of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If any of the damaged property is personal property, reasonable proof of ownership and the value of the damaged personal property. Reasonable proof may include testimony or records documenting the ownership, purchase price, or value of the property, or photographic or similar evidence showing the value of the property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The claimant complied with section 19.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 18.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Except as provided in subsection (2), economic damages are the only compensation for a claim under section 17. Except as provided in subsection (2), a court shall not award and a governmental agency shall not pay noneconomic damages as compensation for an event.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A governmental agency remains subject to tort liability for noneconomic damages caused by an event only if the claimant or the individual on whose behalf the claimant is making the claim has suffered death, serious impairment of body function, or permanent serious disfigurement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In an action for noneconomic damages under section 17, the issues of whether a claimant or the individual on whose behalf the claimant is making the claim has suffered serious impairment of body function or permanent serious disfigurement are questions of law for the court if the court finds either of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   There is no factual dispute concerning the nature and extent of the claimant's or the individual's injuries.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   There is a factual dispute concerning the nature and extent of the claimant's or the individual's injuries, but the dispute is not material to determining whether the claimant or the individual has suffered a serious impairment of body function or permanent serious disfigurement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Unless this act provides otherwise, a party to a civil action brought under section 17 has all applicable common law and statutory defenses ordinarily available in civil actions, and is entitled to all rights and procedures available under the Michigan court rules.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 19.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Except as provided in subsections (3) and (7), a claimant is not entitled to compensation under section 17 unless the claimant notifies the governmental agency of a claim of damage or physical injury, in writing, within 45 days after the date the damage or physical injury was discovered, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered. The written notice under this subsection shall contain the content required by subsection (2)(c) and shall be sent to the individual within the governmental agency designated in subsection (2)(b). To facilitate compliance with this section, a governmental agency owning or operating a sewage disposal system shall make available public information about the provision of notice under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a person who owns or occupies affected property notifies a contacting agency orally or in writing of an event before providing a notice of a claim that complies with subsection (1), the contacting agency shall provide the person with all of the following information in writing:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A sufficiently detailed explanation of the notice requirements of subsection (1) to allow a claimant to comply with the requirements.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The name and address of the individual within the governmental agency to whom a claimant must send written notice under subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The required content of the written notice under subsection (1), which is limited to the claimant's name, address, and telephone number, the address of the affected property, the date of discovery of any property damages or physical injuries, and a brief description of the claim.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A claimant's failure to comply with the notice requirements of subsection (1) does not bar the claimant from bringing a civil action under section 17 against a governmental agency notified under subsection (2) if the claimant can show both of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The claimant notified the contacting agency under subsection (2) during the period for giving notice under subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The claimant's failure to comply with the notice requirements of subsection (1) resulted from the contacting agency's failure to comply with subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a governmental agency that is notified of a claim under subsection (1) believes that a different or additional governmental agency may be responsible for the claimed property damages or physical injuries, the governmental agency shall notify the contacting agency of each additional or different governmental agency of that fact, in writing, within 15 business days after the date the governmental agency receives the claimant's notice under subsection (1). This subsection is intended to allow a different or additional governmental agency to inspect a claimant's property or investigate a claimant's physical injury before litigation. Failure by a governmental agency to provide notice under this subsection to a different or additional governmental agency does not bar a civil action by the governmental agency against the different or additional governmental agency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a governmental agency receives a notice from a claimant or a different or additional governmental agency that complies with this section, the governmental agency receiving notice may inspect the damaged property or investigate the physical injury. A claimant or the owner or occupant of affected property shall not unreasonably refuse to allow a governmental agency subject to a claim to inspect damaged property or investigate a physical injury. This subsection does not prohibit a governmental agency from subsequently inspecting damaged property or investigating a physical injury during a civil action brought under section 17.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If a governmental agency notified of a claim under subsection (1) and a claimant do not reach an agreement on the amount of compensation for the property damage or physical injury within 45 days after the receipt of notice under this section, the claimant may institute a civil action. A civil action shall not be commenced under section 17 until after that 45 days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   This section does not apply to claims for noneconomic damages made under section 17.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An arbitrator may decide a request for summary disposition of a claim or particular issue if either of the following applies:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) All interested parties agree.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If an arbitrator orders a hearing, the arbitrator shall set a time and place and give notice of the hearing not less than 5 days before the hearing begins. Unless a party to the arbitration proceeding makes an objection to lack or insufficiency of notice not later than the beginning of the hearing, the party's appearance at the hearing waives the objection. On request of a party to the arbitration proceeding and for good cause shown, or on the arbitrator's own initiative, the arbitrator may adjourn the hearing from time to time as necessary but shall not postpone the hearing to a time later than that fixed by the agreement to arbitrate for making the award unless the parties to the arbitration proceeding consent to a later date. The arbitrator may hear and decide the controversy on the evidence produced although a party who was duly notified of the arbitration proceeding did not appear. The court, on request, may direct the arbitrator to conduct the hearing promptly and render a timely decision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) At a hearing under subsection (3), a party to the arbitration proceeding has a right to be heard, to present evidence material to the controversy, and to cross-examine witnesses appearing at the hearing.</div>

The arbitrator shall determine the conditions under which the deposition is taken.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>691.1755 Judgment in plaintiff's favor; findings; award of compensation; payments; evidence in civil action; acceptance; compromise or settlement of claim; writing; offset; award as subject to income taxes; payment of child support owed by plaintiff; collection of debt by state or local government; setoff or reimbursement for damages; order.</B><P>Sec. 5.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) In an action under this act, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the plaintiff's favor if the plaintiff proves all of the following by clear and convincing evidence:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The plaintiff was convicted of 1 or more crimes under the law of this state, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment in a state correctional facility for the crime or crimes, and served at least part of the sentence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The plaintiff's judgment of conviction was reversed or vacated and either the charges were dismissed or the plaintiff was determined on retrial to be not guilty. However, the plaintiff is not entitled to compensation under this act if the plaintiff was convicted of another criminal offense arising from the same transaction and either that offense was not dismissed or the plaintiff was convicted of that offense on retrial.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) New evidence demonstrates that the plaintiff did not perpetrate the crime and was not an accomplice or accessory to the acts that were the basis of the conviction, results in the reversal or vacation of the charges in the judgment of conviction or a gubernatorial pardon, and results in either dismissal of all of the charges or a finding of not guilty on all of the charges on retrial.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to subsections (4) and (5), if a court finds that a plaintiff was wrongfully convicted and imprisoned, the court shall award compensation as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Fifty thousand dollars for each year from the date the plaintiff was imprisoned until the date the plaintiff was released from prison, regardless of whether the plaintiff was released from imprisonment on parole or because the maximum sentence was served. For incarceration of less than a year in prison, this amount is prorated to 1/365 of $50,000.00 for every day the plaintiff was incarcerated in prison.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Reimbursement of any amount awarded and collected by this state under the state correctional facility reimbursement act, 1935 PA 253, MCL 800.401 to 800.406.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Reasonable attorney fees incurred in an action under this act. All of the following apply to attorney fees under this act:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The court shall not award attorney fees unless the plaintiff has actually paid the amount awarded to the attorney.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) It is not necessary that the plaintiff pay the attorney fees before an initial award under this act. The court may award attorney fees on a motion brought after the initial award.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The attorney fees must not exceed 10% of the total amount awarded under subdivisions (a) and (b) or $50,000.00, whichever is less, plus expenses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) An award of attorney fees under this act may not be deducted from the compensation awarded the plaintiff, and the plaintiff's attorney is not entitled to receive additional fees from the plaintiff.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An award under subsection (2) is not subject to a limit on the amount of damages except as stated in this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Compensation may not be awarded under subsection (2) for any time during which the plaintiff was imprisoned under a concurrent or consecutive sentence for another conviction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Compensation may not be awarded under subsection (2) for any injuries sustained by the plaintiff while imprisoned. The making of a claim or receipt of compensation under this act does not preclude a claim or action for compensation because of injuries sustained by the plaintiff while imprisoned.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) In the discretion of the court, the total amount awarded under subsection (2)(a) and (b) may be paid to the plaintiff in a single payment or in multiple payments. If the court orders the compensation to be paid in multiple payments, the initial payment must be 20% of the total amount awarded or more and the remainder of the payments must be made over not more than 10 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An award of compensation under this act is not a finding of wrongdoing against anyone. An award of compensation under this act is not admissible in evidence in a civil action that is related to the investigation, prosecution, or conviction that gave rise to the wrongful conviction or imprisonment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The acceptance by the plaintiff of an award under this act, or of a compromise or settlement of the claim, must be in writing and, unless it is procured by fraud, is final and conclusive on the plaintiff, constitutes a complete release of all claims against this state, and is a complete bar to any action in state court by the plaintiff against this state based on the same subject matter. However, the acceptance by the plaintiff of an award under this act, or of a compromise or settlement of the plaintiff's claim, does not operate as a waiver of, or bar to, any action in federal court against an individual alleged to have been involved in the investigation, prosecution, or conviction that gave rise to the wrongful conviction or imprisonment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A compensation award under subsection (2) may not be offset by any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Expenses incurred by this state or any political subdivision of this state, including, but not limited to, expenses incurred to secure the plaintiff's custody or to feed, clothe, or provide medical services for the plaintiff while imprisoned, including expenses required to be collected under the state correctional facility reimbursement act, 1935 PA 253, MCL 800.401 to 800.406. The attorney general is specifically excused from complying with the state correctional facility reimbursement act, 1935 PA 253, MCL 800.401 to 800.406.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The value of any services awarded to the plaintiff under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The value of any reduction in fees for services awarded to the plaintiff under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) An award under subsection (2) is not subject to income taxes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A compensation award under this act is subject to the payment of child support, including child support arrearages, owed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff remains liable for any child support or arrearage under the office of child support act, 1971 PA 174, MCL 400.231 to 400.240, and the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.601 to 552.650, except for any child support or arrearage that erroneously accrued while the plaintiff was imprisoned. Child support must be deducted from an award under this act before the plaintiff receives any of the money from the award. This subsection does not affect any ongoing child support obligation of the plaintiff.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) This act does not impair or limit the right of a state or local government to collect a debt of a plaintiff from the plaintiff's award of compensation under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) An award of compensation under this act is subject to setoff or reimbursement for damages obtained for the wrongful conviction or imprisonment from any other person. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) If a court determines that a plaintiff was wrongfully convicted and imprisoned, the court shall enter an order that provides that any record of the arrest, fingerprints, conviction, and sentence of the plaintiff related to the wrongful conviction be expunged from the criminal history record. A document that is the subject of an order entered under this subsection is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) Any other facts that the court believes are relevant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The court in an action under section 5 may issue an extreme risk protection order without written or oral notice to the respondent if the court determines by clear and convincing evidence from specific facts shown by a verified complaint, written motion, or affidavit that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result from the delay required to effectuate notice or that the notice will itself precipitate adverse action before an extreme risk protection order can be issued. If the petitioner requests the court to issue an extreme risk protection order under this subsection, the court shall make its determination on the request not later than 1 business day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a court issues an extreme risk protection order under subsection (2), including an order described in subsection (4), the court shall, if requested by the restrained individual, conduct a hearing on the order under subsection (1) in accordance with Michigan court rules as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Unless subdivision (b) applies, not later than 14 days after the order is served on the restrained individual or after the restrained individual receives actual notice of the order.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A petitioner who is a law enforcement officer may request an immediate emergency extreme risk protection order under subsection (2) if the officer is responding to a complaint involving the respondent and the respondent can reasonably be expected within the near future to intentionally or unintentionally seriously physically injure the respondent or another individual by possessing a firearm. The law enforcement officer may request an extreme risk protection order under this subsection verbally over the telephone and the judge or magistrate on duty within that jurisdiction may issue the extreme risk protection order. Within 1 business day after an extreme risk protection order is entered under this subsection, the petitioner shall file with the court a sworn written petition detailing the facts and circumstances presented to the court. The issuing court, if other than the circuit court, shall provide a copy of the petition to the circuit court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An individual restrained under an extreme risk protection order may file a motion to modify or rescind the order at any time and request a hearing under supreme court rules.

If the restrained individual files more than 1 motion during a time described in this subsection, the court shall review the motion before a hearing on the motion is held and may summarily dismiss the motion without a response from the petitioner and without a hearing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) At a hearing on a motion under subsection (5), the restrained individual must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the restrained individual no longer poses a risk to seriously physically injure another individual or the restrained individual by possessing a firearm.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a court issues or refuses to issue an extreme risk protection order under this section, the court shall immediately state in writing the specific reasons for issuing or refusing to issue the order. If a hearing is held, the court shall also immediately state on the record the specific reasons for issuing or refusing to issue the order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a court issues an extreme risk protection order under this section, the court shall also determine whether the respondent must immediately surrender the respondent's firearms or surrender the firearms within a 24-hour period. If the court orders the firearms immediately surrendered, it shall also issue an anticipatory search warrant, subject to and contingent on the failure or refusal of the restrained individual, following the service of the order, to immediately comply with the order and immediately surrender to a law enforcement officer any firearm or concealed pistol license in the individual's possession or control, authorizing a law enforcement agency to search the location or locations where the firearm, or firearms, or concealed pistol license is believed to be and to seize any firearm or concealed pistol license discovered during the search in compliance with 1966 PA 189, MCL 780.651 to 780.659. Unless the petitioner is a law enforcement officer or health care provider, there is a presumption that the respondent will have 24 hours to surrender the firearms.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If a court decides to issue an extreme risk protection order under this section, the court may, in its discretion, allow the restrained individual to surrender any firearms to a licensed firearm dealer on the list prepared under section 18.</div>

Before allowing the restrained individual to reclaim a firearm under this subsection, and to determine whether the restrained individual is prohibited from owning or possessing a firearm for another reason, the law enforcement agency shall conduct a verification under the law enforcement information network and the national instant criminal background check system in the same manner as required under section 5b(6) of 1927 PA 372, MCL 28.425b.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A law enforcement agency from whom a restrained individual reclaims a firearm under subsection (7) shall enter into the law enforcement information network and notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation that the court has ordered the firearm returned on expiration of the extreme risk protection order.</div>
