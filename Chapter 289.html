<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   It shall be the duty of the dairy and food commissioner to carefully inquire into the dairy and food and drink products and the several articles which are foods or drinks, or the necessary constituents of foods or drinks, which are manufactured or sold or exposed or offered for sale in this state, and he may, in a lawful manner, procure samples of the same and direct the state analyst to make due and careful examination of the same, and report to the commissioner the result of the analysis of all and any of such food and drink products or dairy products as are adulterated, impure or unwholesome in contravention of the laws of this state; and it shall be the duty of the commissioner to make a complaint against the manufacturer or vendor thereof in the proper county and furnish all evidence thereof, to obtain a conviction of the offense charged. The dairy and food commissioner, or his deputy, or any person appointed by him for that purpose may make complaint and cause proceedings to be commenced against any person for the enforcement of any of the laws relative to adulterated, impure or unwholesome food or drink, and in such case he shall not be obliged to furnish security for costs and shall have power, in the performance of their duties, to enter into any creamery, factory, store, salesroom, drug store, or laboratory, or place where they have reason to believe food or drink are made, stored, sold or offered for sale and open any cask, tub, jar, bottle or package containing, or supposed to contain, any article of food or drink and examine or cause to be examined the contents thereof, and take therefrom samples for analysis. The person making such inspection shall take such sample of such article or product in the presence of at least 1 witness, and he shall, in the presence of said witness, mark or seal such sample and shall tender at the time of taking to the manufacturer or vendor of such product, or to the person having the custody of the same, the value thereof, and a statement in writing for the taking of such sample.

</P>
<P>Sec. 7.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The commissioner, his or her deputy, or any person by the commissioner duly appointed for that purpose, is authorized at all times to seize and take possession of any and all food and dairy products, substitutes therefor, or imitation thereof kept for sale, exposed for sale or held in possession or under the control of any person which in the opinion of the commissioner, or his or her deputy, or such person duly appointed, shall be contrary to the provisions of this act or other laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The person so making such seizure as aforesaid, shall take from such goods as seized a sample for the purpose of analysis and shall cause the remainder thereof to be boxed and sealed and shall leave the same in the possession of the person from whom they were seized, subject to such disposition as shall hereafter be made thereof according to the provisions of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The person so making such seizure shall forward the sample so taken to the state analyst for analysis, who shall make an analysis of the same and shall certify the results of such analysis, which certificate shall be prima facie evidence of the fact or facts therein certified to in any court where the same may be offered in evidence.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If upon such analysis, it shall appear that the food or dairy products are adulterated, substitutes, or imitations within the meaning of this act, the commissioner, or his or her deputy or any person duly authorized, may make complaint before the district or municipal court of the judicial district or municipality where such goods were seized, and the court shall issue a summons to the person from whom the goods were seized, directing him or her to appear not less than 6 nor more than 12 days from the date of the summons and show cause why the goods should not be condemned and disposed of. If the person from whom the goods were seized cannot be found, the summons shall be served upon the person then in possession of the goods. The summons shall be served at least 6 days before the time of appearance mentioned therein. If the person from whom the goods were seized cannot be found, and no one can be found in possession of the goods, and the defendants shall not appear on the return day, then the court shall proceed in the cause in the same manner provided by law where a writ of attachment is returned not personally served upon any of the defendants and none of the defendants shall appear upon the return day.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Unless cause to the contrary thereof is shown, or if the goods shall be found upon trial to be in violation of any of the provisions of this act or other laws which now exist or which may be hereafter enacted, it shall be the duty of the court to render judgment that the seized property be forfeited to the state of Michigan, and that the goods be destroyed or sold by the commissioner for any purpose other than to be used for food. Either parties may appeal to the circuit court as appeals are taken from the district or municipal court rendering the judgment, but it shall not be necessary for the people to give any appeal bond.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The proceeds arising from any such sale shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the general fund: Provided, That if the owner or party claiming the property or goods so declared forfeited can produce and prove a written guarantee of purity, signed by the wholesaler, jobber, manufacturer, or other party from whom the articles were purchased, then the proceeds of the sale of such articles, over and above the costs of seizure, forfeiture, and sale, shall be paid over to such owner or claimant to reimburse him or her, to the extent of such surplus, for his or her actual loss resulting from such seizure and forfeiture, as shown by the invoice.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   It shall be the duty of each prosecuting attorney when called upon by said commissioners [commissioner] or by any person by him or her authorized as aforesaid to render any legal assistance in his or her power in proceedings under the provisions of this act, or any subsequent act relative to the adulteration of food, for the sale of impure or unwholesome food or food products.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A processing operation shall not be found to be a public or private nuisance if the processing operation existed before a change in the use or occupancy of land within 1 mile of the boundaries of the land upon which the processing operation is located and, before that change in use or occupancy of land, the processing operation would not have been found to be a nuisance. The determination of the circumstances described in this subsection or subsection (1) or (2) is considered to be a finding as a matter of law and creates a rebuttable presumption that the processing operation is operating under generally accepted practices or that the processing operation is not a public or private nuisance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A processing operation that is in conformance with subsection (1) or (2) shall not be found to be a public or private nuisance as a result of any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A change in ownership or size.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Temporary cessation or interruption of processing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Adoption of new technology.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The Michigan commission of agriculture shall request the director of the Michigan department of agriculture or his or her designee to investigate all nuisance complaints under this act involving a processing operation. If a person is granted a determination by the director of the department of agriculture under this act, the person is considered to have exhausted his or her administrative remedies with regard to that matter. A court shall not proceed with an action for nuisance brought against a processing operation until it finds that the complainant exhausted all administrative remedies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The Michigan commission of agriculture and the director of the Michigan department of agriculture may enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Michigan department of environmental quality. The investigation and resolution of nuisance complaints shall be conducted pursuant to the memorandum of understanding. In the case where no generally accepted fruit, vegetable, dairy product, meat, and grain processing practices have been established, any nuisance complaint received by either the department of environmental quality or the department of agriculture shall be resolved under section 3 in the following manner:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The department of environmental quality shall assess compliance of an operation or practice with the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.101 to 324.90106, and shall conduct an inspection within 10 working days of receipt of the complaint.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The department of agriculture shall assess the processing operation or practice under federal good manufacturing practices as adopted under the food law of 2000, 2000 PA 92, MCL 289.1101 to 289.8111, and shall conduct an inspection within 10 working days of receipt of the complaint.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Based upon the determinations made in subsection (2), the department of agriculture shall make a finding as to whether a processing operation is in compliance with this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the director of the Michigan department of agriculture or his or her designee finds upon investigation that the person responsible for the processing operation is using generally accepted fruit, vegetable, dairy product, meat, and grain processing practices or otherwise in compliance with law as described in section 3(2), the director of the Michigan department of agriculture or his or her designee shall notify that person and the complainant of this finding in writing. If the director of the Michigan department of agriculture or his or her designee identifies the source or potential sources of the problem caused by the use of other than generally accepted fruit, vegetable, dairy product, meat, and grain processing practices or other than compliance with law as described in section 3(2), the director of the Michigan department of agriculture or his or her designee shall advise the person responsible for the processing operation that necessary changes should be made to resolve or abate the problem and to conform with generally accepted fruit, vegetable, dairy product, meat, and grain processing practices or with applicable law as described in section 3(2). The director of the Michigan department of agriculture or his or her designee shall determine if those changes are implemented and shall notify the person responsible for the processing operation and the complainant of this determination in writing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A complainant who brings more than 3 unverified nuisance complaints against the same processing operation within 3 years may be ordered by the director of the Michigan department of agriculture to pay to the Michigan department of agriculture the full costs of investigation of any fourth or subsequent unverified nuisance complaint against the same processing operation. As used in this subsection, "unverified nuisance complaint" means a nuisance complaint in which the director of the department of agriculture or his or her designee determines that the processing operation is using generally accepted fruit, vegetable, dairy product, meat, and grain processing practices.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the director finds or has probable cause to believe that any food is adulterated or so misbranded as to be dangerous to public health or fraudulent, within the meaning of this act, he or she shall affix to the food a tag or other appropriate marking giving notice that the food is, or is suspected of being, adulterated or misbranded and has been seized or embargoed. A person shall not remove or dispose of the food tagged or marked as embargoed or seized, by sale or otherwise, until permission for removal or disposal is given by the director or a court of competent jurisdiction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If food seized or embargoed under subsection (1) or (2) is determined by the director to be adulterated or misbranded, he or she shall cause a petition to be filed in circuit court in whose jurisdiction the food is seized or embargoed for a complaint for condemnation of the food. Seized or embargoed food shall be destroyed at the expense of the claimant of the food, under the supervision of the director, and the court may order the payment of the costs and fees and storage and other proper expenses by the claimant of the food or his or her agents. However, if the court finds that adulteration or misbranding can be corrected by proper labeling or processing of the food, after entry of the order; payment of the costs, fees, and expenses; and execution of a good and sufficient bond conditioned that the food shall be so labeled or processed, the court may direct the food to be delivered to the claimant for labeling or processing under the supervision of the director. The claimant shall pay the expense of the supervision. The food shall be returned to the claimant of the food on the representation to the court by the director that the food is no longer in violation of this act and that the expenses of supervision have been paid. If the director determines that the food so seized or embargoed is not adulterated or misbranded, he or she shall remove the tag or other marking.</DIV>

Receipt of the application is considered the date the application is received by an agency or department of this state. If the application is considered incomplete by the department, the department shall notify the applicant in writing, or make the information electronically available, within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The period regarding license issuance and renewal is tolled upon notification by the department of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the department.

The failure to issue a license within the time required under this section does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and that application, upon completion, must be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based upon the fact that the license fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) As used in this section, "completed application" means an application complete on its face and submitted with any applicable licensing fees as well as any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of this state. In the case of an initial application, completed application includes the completion of construction or renovation of any facility and the passing of a satisfactory evaluation.</div>
