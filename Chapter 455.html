<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Beginning January 1, 2012, if a corporation subject to this act has real property that has been platted under section 20 and lots in that plat have been leased to stockholders under section 21, all of the taxable and assessed values of the corporation's real property within that plat shall be allocated to the stockholder lessees so that each stockholder lessee is assessed for all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The real property each stockholder lessee leases from the corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Any of the corporation's real property improvements that are within the plat and are available for the common and exclusive use of the corporation's stockholder lessees, including guests of the stockholder lessees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A corporation may propose to the assessor of the local tax collecting district in which the property is located the percentage the assessor may use to allocate the taxable and assessed values of the corporation's property within the plat to the property that the stockholder lessees lease from the corporation. The percentage of allocation that the corporation may propose shall meet all of the following requirements:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The total allocation shall equal 100%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The allocation shall be the same as, or calculated using the same methodology as, the corporation used in the immediately preceding tax year to allocate the corporation's real property taxes to the corporation's stockholders for payment to the corporation, if the corporation made such an allocation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the assessor allocates taxable and assessed values as proposed under subsection (2) and if a stockholder lessee appeals that allocation, that stockholder lessee has the burden of proof to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the taxable and assessed values allocated by the assessor violate this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the taxable and assessed values of a corporation's real property are allocated to the corporation's stockholder lessees under this section, all of the following apply to any real property within the plat that is owned by the corporation and that is available for the common and exclusive use of the stockholder lessees in any subsequent tax year:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The taxable and assessed values are zero, because the value of that real property is included in the assessment of the real property leased by the stockholder lessees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If a stockholder lessee assigns a lease of the corporation's real property and transfers the related corporation stock, the value of the property subject to that lease is deemed to be included in the price paid for a transfer of the real property interests of a stockholder lessee. The purchase price paid for an assignment and transfer as described under this subdivision is not the presumptive true cash value of the property transferred as provided in section 27(5) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.27.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a stockholder lessee assigns a lease of the corporation's real property and transfers the related corporation stock, a property transfer affidavit shall be filed as provided in section 27a(10) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.27a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) As provided under section 27a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.27a, an assessment roll change or tax roll change resulting from the application of this section is not a transfer of ownership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For the 2012 tax year, the total taxable value allocated to the stockholder lessees shall not exceed the total taxable value of the corporation's real property on the tax roll on December 30, 2011 multiplied by the 2012 tax year inflation rate of 1.027. As used in this subsection, "inflation rate" means the rate determined under section 34d of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.34d, which for the 2012 tax year is 1.027.</div>

<P>Sec. 20.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If the by-laws of any such corporation shall provide that the stockholders shall be entitled to select a lot on the lands of said corporation for the purpose of building thereon, it shall be the duty of the directors to cause the lands of said company to be surveyed and platted by a civil engineer, surveyor or other competent person, and to cause a true map or plat thereof to be made. Such map or plat shall in every case be made on a scale not less than 200 feet to an inch, on sheets of good muslin backed paper 18 inches by 24 inches in size. There shall be written upon the paper on which said map or plat shall be made, a full and detailed description of the land embraced in said map or plat, showing the township and range in which such land is situated, and the sections and parts of sections platted and containing the name of the corporation which is the proprietor thereof, and of the engineer, surveyor or person making said map or plat with the date on which the same is made. The same shall be signed by such corporation by its president and secretary, and the engineer, surveyor or person making the same, and shall be witnessed and acknowledged by such proprietor in the same manner as deeds conveying lands are required to be witnessed and acknowledged. The sections and parts of sections platted shall also be designated by the lines drawn upon such map or plat with appropriate letters and figures, and in case of a subdivision of lots or blocks of a previous survey, the outlines of the original or previous lots or blocks so subdivided shall be designated by lines drawn upon such map or plat and shall be marked with appropriate letters and figures. There shall also be on such map or plat, a plain designation of the cardinal points and a correct scale.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The map or plat shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the county in which the land platted is situated. For the purpose of such recording, the said proprietor shall cause to be made by a civil engineer, surveyor or other competent person on the same scale and on paper of the same size and quality as that on which the original map or plat is drawn, an exact duplicate of said map or plat with the detailed description, signatures, witnesses and acknowledgment as above specified. When such map or plat shall conform or shall be made to conform in all respects to requirements of this act, the register and said engineer, surveyor or person who made the same shall each carefully compare said copy with said original map or plat, and if correct, or when made correct, it shall be certified by the said register and said engineer, surveyor or person who made the same, who shall certify that they have carefully compared the same with said map or plat and that it is an exact copy thereof and the whole of such original map or plat. The said register shall then securely fasten the said copy in the book provided by the laws of this state for the recording of town plats, and such copy so fastened in said book, shall be held and taken to be a record of the said map or plat with a like effect as if the said map or plat had been actually transcribed by said register in a book in his office, but in no case shall any such map or plat be recorded until it shall be made to conform to all the requirements of this act. The register shall certify on such map or plat when it was recorded as aforesaid with reference to the book or page where recorded, and shall note in such record, the time when made, and keep an index thereof the same as required by the laws of this state relating to township plats. The original map or plat with a certificate of record endorsed thereon, the record thereof made as aforesaid, or a properly certified transcript of such record shall be received in all courts of this state as prima facie evidence of the making and recording of such map or plat in conformity with the provisions of this act. For all service by this act required to be performed by a register of deeds in respect to any such map or plat brought into his office for record, said register shall be entitled to receive the sum of 2 dollars which shall be paid by the proprietor of the ground platted: Provided, That the making and recording of said plat in the manner aforesaid shall not operate or be construed to dedicate or surrender to the public in any manner whatsoever or any part or portion of the lands so platted: And provided further, That all streets, avenues, alleys, parks or public places laid out and designated on such plat, shall be and remain at all times for the common use, benefit and advantage of all of the stockholders of such company, and shall not be changed, vacated or altered except on a vote of 4/5 of the shares of stock of said corporation at a meeting duly called for that purpose.</DIV>
