<P>Sec. 2.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Any custom, practice, or usage of the trade to the contrary notwithstanding:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   When an artist or other person delivers or causes to be delivered a work of fine art to an art dealer for the purpose of sale on a commission, the delivery to and acceptance of the work of fine art by the art dealer is considered to be on consignment and the art dealer shall thereafter, with respect to the work of fine art, be considered to be the consignee of the work of fine art.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A work of fine art initially received on consignment shall be considered to remain trust property notwithstanding the subsequent purchase of the work of fine art by the consignee directly or indirectly for the consignee's own account until the terms of purchase are completed. If the work is thereafter resold to a third party who is a bona fide purchaser before the consignor has been paid in full, the work of fine art ceases to be trust property and the proceeds of the resale are trust funds in the hands of the consignee for the benefit of the consignor to the extent necessary to pay any balance still due to the consignor. The trusteeship relating to proceeds of the resale shall continue until the fiduciary obligation of the consignee with respect to a transaction is discharged in full.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   As used in this act:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   “Art merchant” means a person who deals in works of fine art or by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to works of fine art or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed by his employment of an agent or broker or other intermediary who by his occupation holds himself out as having such knowledge or skill. It includes an auctioneer who sells works of fine art at public auction as well as the auctioneer's consignor or principal.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   “Author” or “authorship” refers to the creator of a work of fine art or to the period, culture, source or origin with which the creation of the work is identified in the description of the work.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   “Counterfeit” means a work of fine art made or altered, with intent to deceive, in a manner that it appears to have an authorship which it does not in fact possess. It includes any work of fine art made, altered or copied in a manner that it appears to have an authorship which it does not in fact possess even though the work may not have been made with intent to deceive.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   “Fine art” means a painting, sculpture, drawing or work of graphic art.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   “Person” means an individual, partnership, corporation, association or other group however organized.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   “Written instrument” means a written or printed agreement, bill of sale, or any other written or printed note or memorandum of the sale or exchange of a work of fine art by an art merchant and includes a written or printed catalog or other prospectus of a forthcoming sale as well as any written or printed corrections or amendments thereof.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Any provision in any other law to the contrary notwithstanding:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If an art merchant, in selling or exchanging a work of fine art, furnishes to a buyer of the work who is not an art merchant, a written instrument which, in describing the work, identifies it with an author or authorship, the description is presumed to be part of the basis of the bargain and creates an express warranty of the authenticity of the authorship as of the date of the sale or exchange. However, if an art merchant furnishes the name of an artist pursuant to section 7 or 8 of the art multiples sales act, the art merchant for purposes of that information is bound by this section, whether or not the purchaser is an art merchant. The warranty is not negated or limited because the art merchant in the written instrument did not use formal words such as “warrant” or “guarantee”, because he or she did not have a specific intention or authorization to make a warranty, or because any statement relevant to authorship is, or purports to be, or is capable of being merely the art merchant's opinion.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   In construing the degree of authenticity of authorship warranted, due regard shall be given to the terminology used in describing the authorship and the meaning accorded to the terminology by the customs and usage of the trade at the time and in the locality where the sale or exchange took place. A written instrument delivered pursuant to a sale which took place in this state which, in describing the work, states, for example:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   That the work is by a named author or has a named authorship, without any other limiting words, means, unequivocally, that the work is by the named author or has the named authorship.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   That the work is attributed to a named author means a work of the period of the author, attributed to the author, but not with certainty by the named author.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   That the work is of the school of a named author means a work of the period of the author, by a pupil or close follower of the author but not by the author.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Words relevant to the creation of an express warranty of authenticity of authorship of a work of fine art and words tending to negate or limit warranty shall be construed where reasonable as consistent with each other; but subject to the provisions of section 2202 of Act No. 174 of the Public Acts of 1962, being section 440.2202 of the Compiled Laws of 1948, on parol or extrinsic evidence, negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that the construction is unreasonable. Subject to the limitations hereinafter set forth, the construction shall be deemed unreasonable in any of the following cases:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The language tending to negate or limit the warranty is not conspicuous, written and contained in a provision, separate and apart from any language relevant to the creation of the warranty, in words which would clearly and specifically apprise the buyer that the seller assumes no risk, liability or responsibility for the authenticity of the authorship of a work of fine art. Words of general disclaimer like “all warranties, express or implied, are excluded” are not sufficient to negate or limit an express warranty of authenticity of the authorship of a work of fine art, created under section 2 or otherwise.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The work of fine art is proved to be a counterfeit, and this was not clearly indicated in the description of the work.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The work of fine art is unqualifiedly stated to be the work of a named author or authorship and it is proved that, as of the date of sale or exchange, the statement was false, mistaken or erroneous.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An art merchant shall not sell or consign a multiple in, into, or from the state unless a written instrument is furnished to the purchaser or consignee, before the sale or consignment, which states as to each multiple the information required under sections 5, 6, 7, and 8 for the applicable time period. For auctions, this information may be furnished in a catalog or other written material which is readily available for examination and purchase before the sale, if a bill of sale, receipt, or invoice describing the sale is supplied which makes reference to the catalog and lot number in which the information appears.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Information supplied pursuant to subsection (1) shall be clearly, specifically, and distinctly addressed to each of the items listed in sections 5, 6, 7, and 8.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The name of the artist.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the artist's name appears on the multiple, the source of the name, such as whether the multiple was signed by the artist, whether only the master was signed, whether the artist's name was stamped or estate stamped on the multiple, or whether the name originates from some other stated source.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A description of the medium and process used to produce the multiple, such as whether the multiple was produced through etching, engraving, lithography, serigraphy, or photography. If photography was used, the particular method and materials used in the photographic developing process shall be stated.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Whether the artist was deceased at the time the master which produced the multiple was made.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Whether the multiple or image on or in the master is a mechanical, photomechanical, or photographic copy or reproduction of an image previously created or produced by the artist in a different stated medium, or on or in a different master, for a purpose other than the creation of the multiple being described.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   If subdivision (e) is applicable, and if the multiple is not signed, whether the artist authorized or approved, in writing, the multiple or edition of which the multiple is a part.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Unless otherwise disclosed, the number of multiples stated pursuant to subsection (1)(j) shall constitute an express warranty that no additional numbered multiples of the same image, exclusive of proofs, have been produced.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The number of multiples stated pursuant to subsection (1)(j) shall also constitute an express warranty that no additional multiples of the same image, whether or not designated “proofs”, other than trial proofs, numbered or otherwise, have been produced in an amount which exceeds the number in the limited edition by 10 or 10%, whichever is greater.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as provided in subsection (2), information furnished by an art merchant pursuant to this act shall form a part of the basis of the bargain and shall create an express warranty as to each item of information provided.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If an art merchant furnishes the name of the artist pursuant to section 7 or 8, the art merchant for purposes of that information shall be bound only by section 2 of Act No. 121 of the Public Acts of 1970, being section 442.322 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, except that section shall be considered to include sales to art merchants.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The warranty provided in subsection (1) shall not be negated or limited because the art merchant in the written instrument does not use the words “warrant” or “guarantee”, or because the art merchant did not have a specific intention or authorization to make the warranty, or because any required statement is, or purports to be, or may be merely the seller's opinion.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Except as provided in subsection (5), the existence of a basis in fact for information warranted pursuant to this section is not a defense in an action to enforce the warranty.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A statement made pursuant to section 2(2) that an item of information not supplied is not applicable creates an express warranty that the information is not applicable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A statement made pursuant to section 2(2) disclaiming knowledge as to an item of information is ineffective unless the disclaimer is clearly, specifically, and categorically stated to be applicable to the specific item, and is contained within the physical context of other language setting forth the required information applicable to a particular multiple.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If for purposes of effecting the sale of a multiple, an art merchant has agreed to act as the agent for a consignor who is not an art merchant, or if for purposes of supplying the information required by this act, an art merchant has agreed to act as the agent for an artist, the art merchant shall incur the liabilities prescribed by this act with respect to a purchaser. However, if the art merchant can establish that his or her liability results from incorrect information which was provided to the art merchant in writing by the consignor or artist, and that the art merchant in good faith relied on the information, the consignor or artist shall similarly incur the liabilities with respect to the purchaser and the art merchant.</DIV>
