<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Provide new or increased total designed withdrawal capacity for a new or increased large quantity withdrawal of more than 1,000,000 gallons of water per day from the waters of the state to supply a common distribution system that the department confirms is a zone C withdrawal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Provide new total designed withdrawal capacity or an increased total designed withdrawal capacity that will result in an intrabasin transfer of more than 100,000 gallons per day average over any 90-day period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The department shall provide public notice that it is conducting an evaluation under subsection (3) and shall provide a public comment period of not less than 45 days before making a determination on that evaluation. The department shall reject the plans and specifications for a proposed waterworks system evaluated under subsection (3) if it determines that the proposed system will not meet the applicable standard provided in section 32723 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.32723. However, the department may approve the plans and specifications for a proposed waterworks system evaluated under subsection (3) for a community supply owned by a political subdivision that the department determines will not meet the applicable standard provided in section 32723 if the plans and specifications do not result in an intrabasin transfer of more than 100,000 gallons per day average over any 90-day period and both of the following conditions are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The department determines that there is no feasible and prudent alternative location for the withdrawal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The department includes in the approval conditions related to depth, pumping capacity, rate of flow, and ultimate use that ensure that the environmental impact of the withdrawal is balanced by the public benefit of the withdrawal related to public health, safety, and welfare. This subdivision does not confer upon the department any authority to require a person to connect or to remain connected to an existing drinking water supply system owned by a political subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The department's approval of a proposed waterworks system under this section shall be considered to satisfy the requirements of section 4.11 of the compact.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Before commencing the construction of a waterworks system or an alteration, addition, or improvement to a system, a supplier of water shall submit the plans and specifications for the improvements to the department and secure from the department a permit for construction as provided by rule. Plans and specifications submitted to the department shall be prepared by a professional engineer licensed under article 20 of the occupational code, 1980 PA 299, MCL 339.2001 to 339.2014. A contractor, builder, or supplier of water shall not engage in or begin the construction of a waterworks system or an alteration, addition, or improvement to a waterworks system until a valid permit for the construction has been secured from the department. A contractor, builder, or supplier of water who permits or allows construction to proceed without a valid permit, or in a manner not in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the department, violates this act. A supplier of water shall not issue a voucher or check or in any other way expend money or provide consideration for construction of a waterworks system unless a valid permit issued by the department is in effect. The department may issue a permit with conditions to correct minor design deficiencies. If eligible, a supplier may request an expedited review of an application for a permit under section 4a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The department may deny a permit for construction of a waterworks system or an alteration, addition, or improvement to a waterworks system if the most recent capacity assessment shows that the waterworks system does not have adequate technical, financial, or managerial capacity to meet the requirements of this act and the rules promulgated under this act, and the deficiencies identified in that capacity assessment remain uncorrected, unless the proposed construction will remedy the deficiencies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The department may verbally approve minor modifications of a construction permit issued by the department as a result of unforeseen site conditions that become apparent during construction. Minor modifications include, but are not limited to, extending a hydrant lead or routing a water main around a manhole. A supplier making a request for a modification shall provide to the department all relevant information required under this section and the application form provided by the department related to the modification. A supplier shall obtain written approval from the department for all modifications to a waterworks system except when the department provides verbal approval for a minor modification as provided for in this subsection. A supplier receiving a written or verbal approval from the department shall submit revised plans and specifications to the department within 10 days from the date of approval.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If a supplier seeks confirmation of the department's verbal approval of a minor modification under subsection (8), the supplier shall notify the department electronically, at an address specified by the department, with a detailed description of the request for the modification. The department shall make reasonable efforts to respond within 2 business days, confirming whether the request has been approved or not approved. If the department has not responded within 2 business days after the department receives the detailed description, the verbal approval shall be considered confirmed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) As a condition of a permit issued under this section to a community supply, the department shall require the permit holder to annually submit to the department a report by April 1 of each year that contains the information described in section 32707 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.32707.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) As used in this section, "assessment tool", "compact", "intrabasin transfer", "new or increased large quantity withdrawal", "waters of the state", and "zone C withdrawal" mean those terms as they are defined in section 32701 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.32701.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   As used in this section, "product" means any chemical or substance added to a public water supply, any materials used in the manufacture of public water supply components or appurtenances, or any pipe, storage tank, valve, fixture, or other materials which come in contact with water intended for use in a public water supply.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The department may promulgate rules setting standards of quality, composition, safety, or design of products. Until the department promulgates rules setting standards for products, all products that may come in contact with water intended for use in a public water supply shall meet American national standards institute/national sanitation foundation standards, specifically ANSI/NSF standard 60-1988 and ANSI/NSF standard 61-1988 which are hereby incorporated by reference. Adoption of a product standard by rule supersedes the standard incorporated by reference in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Only products that meet the standards provided for in subsection (2) shall be used by a supplier of water in a public water supply. Certification that a product meets the standards provided for in subsection (2) by a laboratory accredited by American national standards institute to test and certify products shall be prima facie evidence that a product meets the standards. The department shall make a list of products meeting the standards available at no charge.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A supplier of water shall compile and maintain on file for inspection by the department a list of all products used by the supplier of water. Prior to using a product not previously listed, a supplier of water shall either determine that the product has been certified in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) or shall notify the department of the type, name, and manufacturer of a product.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Upon request of the department, a supplier of water shall, prior to making use of a product, supply to the department all documents and materials, including samples of a product, needed to review the type, quality, and nature of a product that will come in contact with the public water supply. The supplier of water shall provide sufficient information to enable the department to determine whether a product meets the standard provided for in subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If a product is reviewed by the department and found not to comply with the standards provided for in subsection (2), the department shall notify the supplier of water and shall be given an opportunity to request a hearing on whether the product meets the standards. At a hearing, the supplier of water must demonstrate that the product meets the standards before the product can be used by the supplier of water.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A person shall not willfully introduce or permit or allow the introduction of a product into a public water supply that has not first been determined by the department to meet standards provided for in subsection (2).</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If regulated contaminants are detected in a public water supply, and certain subpopulations are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects because of age, gender, pregnancy, or preexisting medical conditions, the consumer confidence report or other reports and notices, or both, shall contain information related to all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The contaminant that was detected.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The level of the contaminant that was detected.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The vulnerable population that may be susceptible to the level of contaminant detected.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The potential adverse health effects associated with exposure of the vulnerable population to the level of contaminant detected in the water supply. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The department shall inspect a waterworks system or a part of a waterworks system, and the manner of operation of the system or part. If upon inspection the department determines the waterworks system to be inadequate or so operated as to not adequately protect the public health, the department may order the supplier of water to make alterations in the waterworks system or its method of operation as may be required or considered advisable by the department to assure the public water supply is adequate, healthful, and in conformance with state drinking water standards. If the supplier does not request a public hearing within 30 days after receipt of the order, the order shall be final and binding on the supplier of water. If the department receives a request for a public hearing within the specified 30 days, the public hearing shall be immediately arranged. A supplier of water shall comply with a final order of the department.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a public water supply poses an imminent hazard to the public health, the department may issue an emergency order immediately, without notice or hearing, requiring such action as the department determines is necessary to protect the public health. Normal administrative procedures as required by the administrative procedures act of 1969, Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, as amended, being sections 24.201 to 24.328 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, shall proceed concurrently with an emergency order upon written request of the supplier of water received within 15 days. An emergency order shall be effective immediately and binding until modified or rescinded by the department or a court of competent jurisdiction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The department may take appropriate action to limit water system expansion or limit water use from a public water supply until such time as satisfactory improvements are made in the system or operation to provide for a continuous, adequate supply of water meeting the state drinking water standards.</DIV>
