<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The motor carrier division of the department of state police, the chief of an organized fire department or police department, a peace officer, or a firefighter in uniform acting under the orders and directions of the local fire chief may inspect a vehicle transporting a hazardous material. Subject to subsection (3), if upon inspection a vehicle is found to be in violation of the rules with respect to safety equipment, the motor carrier division or the inspecting chief, firefighter, or peace officer shall attach to the vehicle a notice identifying the vehicle and stating that it is condemned against further use in the transportation of hazardous material, and listing the violations found. If the vehicle is en route to a destination where its load is to be delivered, the motor carrier division, chief, firefighter, or peace officer, except as otherwise provided in this act, shall allow the vehicle to proceed to make deliveries after which the vehicle shall be returned to its base or customary place of maintenance and repair or taken to a suitable place for repair. If, upon inspection, a vehicle while en route to a delivery destination is found to be in a condition that makes it likely that further operation under normal road and traffic conditions will result in spillage of hazardous material, the motor carrier division, chief, firefighter, or peace officer shall have the vehicle impounded. The vehicle shall be impounded at a suitable place where the hazardous material being transported can be unloaded with reasonable safety, and until the unloading is accomplished and arrangements are made to return the vehicle with reasonable safety to its base or customary place of maintenance and repair, or to move the vehicle to a suitable place of repair. If, upon inspection, the braking, lighting, steering, coupling, sounding, or other devices on a vehicle are found to be in a condition such that the vehicle cannot be operated by a prudent operator without undue risk of accident, the motor carrier division, chief, firefighter, or peace officer shall have the vehicle impounded at a suitable place until the necessary repairs are made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as provided in this act, a vehicle condemned under this act shall not be used in transporting hazardous material until released under this section. Upon being returned to its base or customary place of maintenance and repair, or to a suitable place of repair, the condemned vehicle may be impounded there upon order of the motor carrier division of the department of state police until the conditions for which the condemnation was issued have been corrected. However, the motor carrier division may authorize the temporary release of the condemned vehicle for a reasonable time needed to procure parts or appurtenances necessary to correct the conditions for which the vehicle was condemned. Upon correction of the conditions, the motor carrier division, chief of an organized fire department or police department, a peace officer, or a firefighter in uniform acting under a chief's direction, shall be notified and shall reinspect the vehicle. The motor carrier division, chief, peace officer, or firefighter shall release the vehicle if upon reinspection the vehicle is found to be in compliance with this act and the rules promulgated under this act, and if reasonable impounding expenses have been paid by the owner of the vehicle. A person inspecting a vehicle under this act shall notify the motor carrier division under rules promulgated under this act, of the circumstances and conditions of each violation, condemnation, impounding, and release.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2), an official named in subsection (1) inspecting a commercial motor vehicle under the authority of this section shall attach notices, and place vehicles and drivers out of service, only as provided under the motor carrier safety act of 1963, 1963 PA 181, MCL 480.11 to 480.25, and as provided under the out of service criteria issued under the authority of the commercial vehicle safety alliance. As used in this subsection, "commercial motor vehicle" means that term as defined in the motor carrier safety act of 1963, 1963 PA 181, MCL 480.11 to 480.25.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the state fire marshal has reason to believe that a crime or other offense has been committed in connection with a fire, the state fire marshal may conduct an inquiry with relation to the fire. The inquiry shall be held at the time and place the state fire marshal directs and may be continued from time to time and to the place the state fire marshal directs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The state fire marshal may issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses to testify at the inquiry and for the production of books, records, papers, documents, or other writings or things considered material to the inquiry, may administer oaths or affirmations to witnesses, and may cause testimony to be taken stenographically and transcribed and preserved. Willful false swearing by a witness is perjury.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a subpoena is disobeyed, the state fire marshal may invoke the aid of the circuit court in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, records, papers, documents, or other writings or things considered material to the inquiry. A judge of the circuit court having jurisdiction in the county in which the inquiry is conducted may issue an order requiring the person to appear before the state fire marshal and to produce books, records, papers, documents, or other writings or things considered material to the inquiry and give evidence concerning the matter in question. Failure to obey the court's order may be punished as contempt of the court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A person shall not be excused from testifying or from producing books, records, papers, documents, or other writings or things considered material to the inquiry in an investigation or at a hearing when ordered to do so by the state fire marshal on the ground that the testimony or evidence may tend to incriminate the person or subject the person to a criminal penalty. Truthful testimony, evidence, or other truthful information compelled under this section and any information derived directly or indirectly from that truthful testimony, evidence, or other truthful information shall not be used against the witness in a criminal case, except for impeachment purposes or in a prosecution for perjury, making a false statement, or otherwise failing to testify or produce evidence as required.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The state fire marshal, or the chief of an organized fire department, regular or voluntary, or a fire fighter in uniform acting under the orders and directions of the local fire chief; or the clerk of a city, village, township, or county not having an organized fire department, or the managing head of an organized fire district in this state, upon complaint of a person having an interest in a building or premises or property adjacent to a building or premises, or at the official's own instance without a complaint and without restraint or liability for trespass, may at an hour reasonable under the circumstances involved, enter into and upon a building or premises within the official's jurisdictions for the purpose of inspection and examination of the building or premises, together with their occupancies and contents, for the discovery of the existence of a fire hazard. When an official finds a building or premises, either public or private, which for want of repairs, lack of or insufficient fire escapes, automatic or other fire alarm apparatus or fire extinguishing equipment, or by reason of age or dilapidated condition, defective electrical wiring or electrical equipment, defective chimneys, defective gas connections, defective heating apparatus, accumulation of rubbish, waste materials, or flammable substances or decorations, or from any other condition, or for any other reason, may cause an otherwise preventable fire or explosion or endanger other property or premises or be dangerous to the public peace, security, or safety, the official may reduce to writing the official's findings on the inspection and examination and file the same with the department, with a report stating the ownership, location, and description of the building or buildings or premises inspected, and with other data and information as the state fire marshal prescribes in those cases, together with recommendations relative to the abatement of the fire hazard.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 9.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upon the filing of the findings and report provided in section 8, the state fire marshal, from the findings and report or from an additional report or investigation the state fire marshal considers necessary, may make a determination as to whether, and to what extent the building should be repaired or whether the building should be razed and completely removed; whether the use or occupancy of the building, or buildings, should be changed or terminated; and, in the case of premises other than buildings, to what extent the building should be cleared or improved or the hazardous condition remedied. The state fire marshal may make any other or further determination which, in the opinion of the state fire marshal, should be made to effectively protect the peace, security, and safety of persons and property. Following the determination of the state fire marshal, the state fire marshal may make and execute an order directed to the owner of the building or premises, based upon the determination, and cause the same to be served upon the owner and other parties as the state fire marshal considers to be interested in the subject matter of the order. If the order requires a building to be repaired, the owner shall be given not less than 10 days after the date of service of the order to signify in writing an intention to comply with the order. If the order requires the building to be torn down, removed, or repaired, the owner of the building shall be given not less than 30 days after the date of service of the order to comply with the order. Failure on the part of an owner served with an order to repair to signify an intention within the time limits prescribed in this section shall be considered a refusal to obey the order. If the owner of the building or premises is unknown, service may be made as provided in section 10(c). This section shall not be construed to prevent a local unit of government from enforcing local ordinances or charter provisions relating to the occupancy, repair, demolition, clearing, or otherwise rendering safe a building which is in a hazardous or dangerous condition.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The existence of a fire hazard, of any nature, origin, or cause, is a nuisance and the nuisance may be abated, removed, corrected, and its continuance enjoined in the manner provided by law for the abatement of nuisances. If the state fire marshal determines that a fire hazard is imminently dangerous or menacing to human life and the public safety requires its immediate abatement, removal, correction, or discontinuance, the state fire marshal may bring, or cause to be brought, in the circuit court of the county in which the fire hazard is located, an action to abate, remove, correct, or discontinue the fire hazard. Sections 3801 to 3840 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.3801 to 600.3840, apply to the action. The court, in addition to the powers conferred by that act, may make any order it determines is necessary or expedient to ensure the safety and security of human life, and may direct that a building described in the complaint be razed and removed and all rubbish and debris removed, or that the building be repaired and in what manner and to what extent. The court may order the removal of occupancies of a building and the discontinuance of any use of the building that constitute a fire hazard or menace to human life, and may order the clearing and improvement of premises described in the complaint. The court may issue an injunction restraining the defendant from continuing the existence of a fire hazard, may include specific directions to the defendant, and may retain jurisdiction to compel complete performance of the order, writ, or other determination of the court. The court may direct that the abatement of the fire hazard be done by the department under the court's instructions, and with provision for defraying the cost and expense of the abatement as the court determines equitable and authorized by this act. A continuance of a hearing under this act shall not be granted except upon a clear showing of unavoidable circumstances. Jurisdiction of the court under this act does not depend upon the amount of money, or value of property, involved.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The apportioned vehicle registration fee required under section 3 shall be equal to the percentage of transportation in this state multiplied by the percentage of all hazardous materials transportation, multiplied by the total number of power units operated, multiplied by a per-vehicle fee of $50.00, and shall be calculated as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A motor carrier shall determine its percentage of transportation in this state by dividing the number of miles traveled in this state under the international registration plan during the previous year by the number of miles it traveled nationwide under the international registration plan. If a motor carrier operated only in this state, its percentage is 100%. If a motor carrier is not registered in the international registration plan, the motor carrier shall calculate the number of miles traveled using the method in the international registration plan. If a motor carrier operates more than 1 fleet under the international registration plan, the motor carrier may calculate each fleet's contribution to the motor carrier's total fee separately. A motor carrier who operated in another state under a reciprocal agreement with that state shall include the miles operated under the agreement as miles traveled in this state in calculating mileage under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A motor carrier shall determine its percentage of hazardous materials transportation using either of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   For less than truckload shipments, it must divide the weight of all of the motor carrier's hazardous materials shipments transported during the previous year by the total weight of all shipments transported during the same year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   For truckload shipments, it must divide the total number of hazardous materials shipments during the previous year by the total number of all shipments transported during the same year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A motor carrier shall select the midpoint of the 10% range that most closely approximates the motor carrier's calculation of its hazardous materials transportation business, under either option in subdivision (b).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A motor carrier may use data from its most recent complete fiscal year or the most recent calendar year in calculating the percentage required under this section.</DIV>

If the department approves of the proposed test method and determines that the performance standard proposed by the manufacturer is equivalent to the performance standard prescribed in subsection (3), the manufacturer may employ that test method and performance standard to certify the cigarette under section 7. If the department determines that another state has enacted reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards that include a test method and performance standard that are the same as those contained in this act and the department finds that the officials responsible for implementing those requirements have approved the proposed alternative test method and performance standard for a particular cigarette proposed by a manufacturer as meeting the fire safety standards of that state's law or regulation under a legal provision comparable to this section, the department shall authorize that manufacturer to employ the alternative test method and performance standard to certify that cigarette for sale in this state, unless the department demonstrates a reasonable basis why the alternative test should not be accepted. All other applicable requirements of this section apply to the manufacturer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A manufacturer shall maintain copies of the reports of all tests conducted under this act on all cigarettes offered for sale in this state for a period of 3 years and make copies of these reports available to the department or the attorney general upon written request. Any manufacturer who fails to make copies of these reports available within 60 days of receiving a written request from the department or the attorney general is subject to a civil fine of not more than $10,000.00 for each day after the sixtieth day that the manufacturer does not make the copies available to the department or the attorney general.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The department may adopt a subsequent ASTM standard test method for measuring the ignition strength of cigarettes if it finds that the subsequent method does not result in a change in the percentage of full-length burns exhibited by any tested cigarette when compared to the percentage of full-length burns the same cigarette would exhibit when tested in accordance with the ASTM standard described in subsection (2)(a) and the performance standard described in subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The department shall implement this section in accordance with the implementation and substance of the New York fire safety standards for cigarettes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The department shall review the effectiveness of this section and report every 3 years to the legislature the department's findings and, if appropriate, recommendations for legislation to improve the effectiveness of this act. The department shall submit the report and legislative recommendations no later than the first June 30 following the conclusion of each 3-year period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) This section does not prohibit any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A wholesale or retail dealer from selling its existing inventory of cigarettes if the wholesale or retail dealer can establish that state tax stamps were affixed to the cigarettes before the effective date of this act and the wholesale or retail dealer can establish that the inventory was purchased before the effective date of this act in comparable quantity to the inventory purchased during the same period of the preceding year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The sale of cigarettes solely for the purpose of consumer testing. For purposes of this subdivision, "consumer testing" means an assessment of cigarettes that is conducted by a manufacturer, or under the control and direction of a manufacturer, for the purpose of evaluating consumer acceptance of those cigarettes, utilizing only the quantity of cigarettes that is reasonably necessary for that assessment.</div>
