<P>Sec. 2.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The repeal of Act No. 192 of the Public Acts of 1941 is predicated upon the determination by the legislature that the breeding, raising, and producing in captivity, and the marketing, by the producer, of mink as live animals or as animal pelts or carcasses, shall be considered an agricultural pursuit, and all such animals raised in captivity shall be considered domestic animals, subject to all the laws of the state with reference to possession, ownership, and taxation as are at any time applicable to domestic animals, and all persons engaged in these activities are farmers and engaged in farming for all statutory purposes. The repeal of Act No. 192 of the Public Acts of 1941 shall not be construed to place domestic mink farms under the provisions of part 427 (breeders and dealers) of the natural resources and environmental protection act, Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.42701 to 324.42714 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
