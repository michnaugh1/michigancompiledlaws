Each county public administrator shall hold office at the pleasure of the state public administrator and shall be appointed to act as county public administrator only in and of the county in which he maintains his legal residence or principal place of business. A county public administrator shall not receive a salary or other emoluments of office but shall, when appointed fiduciary of an estate by virtue of this act, be allowed all necessary expenses incurred in the administration thereof, together with other fees, compensation, and allowances authorized by statute and by order of the judge of probate to be paid the fiduciary out of the estate, all of which expenses, fees, compensation, and allowances shall be paid out of the corpus of the estate administered. In a county of this state in which there is no person both suitable and willing to act as a county public administrator in and for the county, the state public administrator may appoint the county public administrator of an adjoining county to act in that county.</DIV>
