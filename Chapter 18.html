<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>An award for each covered expense or loss must be paid in a lump sum, except that for payments to health care providers under section 5a or in the case of death or protracted disability, the commission may specify that the award shall provide for periodic payments to compensate for out-of-pocket expenses, or loss of earnings or support. An award made pursuant to this act shall not be subject to execution or attachment other than for expenses resulting from the personal injury that is the basis for the claim. Any court of record, in establishing sentence for a felon convicted of a crime resulting in awards paid under this section, may impose a condition that the sentence include a method for reimbursement to the state, within the ability of the felon to comply, of the costs paid under this act to a victim of a crime for which the conviction was made. The reimbursement will be paid into the general fund of the state. The condition of reimbursement may include a provision relating suspension or probation to reimbursement or may be in lieu of other sentencing and shall be enforceable by the court to the degree that failure to meet the terms of reimbursement may be cause for reversion to an alternate sentence or to completion of an unfinished sentence.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Except as otherwise expressly provided or as provided in section 246, a construction appropriation includes, where applicable, costs for land; professional services, including engineering and inspection services; all construction trades work; utilities; site work; on site supervision; equipment; furniture; and furnishings for a completed facility ready for use. The appropriation for a project authorized in a budget act shall be charged with any direct labor performed on that project by employees of the state agency for which the appropriations are made. For each construction project for which the department is an agent, the department shall determine the need for a resident inspector to provide on site supervision. The department may employ and assign the resident inspector with the inspector's salary to be paid from the project account, or from the account designated by the department. If the department approves, a qualified employee of the state agency's regular staff may be the resident inspector with the inspector's salary to be paid from the state agency's operating funds. This subsection shall apply to all projects regardless of when the appropriations were made for the project. The direct labor charges and corresponding credits shall be made in accordance with the systems and procedures prescribed by the department. Charges shall not be made to projects for any indirect or administrative overhead costs, except professional services by a state agency if the professional services are approved by the department and if the department is the agent for the project and provides professional services or administers and supervises the project. The director may establish separate accounts within an appropriation to permit a state agency, community college, or institution of higher education to make expenditures for equipment, furniture, and furnishings. The director shall carry out this act and shall exercise the best professional judgment in the design and construction of all projects included within a budget act so that the design and construction meets the requirements of the projects in the most economical and efficient manner, with particular emphasis on future maintenance and operating cost.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A contract to complete the construction of a project for which construction appropriations are made in a budget act shall be made upon the conditions that the total cost for the completion of each facility, ready for use, shall not exceed the total cost authorized for each respective project; that the obligations for payments for each project, during the fiscal years subject to this act, shall not exceed the amount appropriated for each specific facility by this and previous budget acts; and that the contract may be awarded before the beginning of the next fiscal year if the terms of the contract provide that payments shall not be made until after the first day of the following fiscal year, except in amounts previously appropriated.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Filed a Michigan single business tax return or Michigan business tax return showing a portion or all of the income tax base allocated or apportioned to the state of Michigan pursuant to the former single business tax act, 1975 PA 228, or the Michigan business tax act, 2007 PA 36, MCL 208.1101 to 208.1601.</div>

<P>Sec. 391.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    When it appears to the governor, based upon written information received by the governor from the budget director and the department of treasury, that actual revenues for a fiscal period will fall below the revenue estimates on which appropriations for that period were based, the estimates being as determined by the legislature in accordance with section 31 of article IV of the state constitution of 1963, the governor shall order the director to review all appropriations made by the legislature, except those made for the legislative and judicial branches of government or from funds constitutionally dedicated to specific purposes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Based upon needs, the director shall recommend to the governor a reduction of expenditures authorized by the appropriations, either direct or open-ended, for that fiscal year. The governor shall review the recommendations of the director and shall prepare an order containing reductions in expenditures authorized so that actual revenues for the fiscal period will be sufficient to equal the expenditures. The governor shall give not less than 5 days' written notice to the members of the appropriations committees specifying a time and place for a joint meeting of the governor and the appropriations committees, at which the governor shall present to the appropriations committees the governor's recommendations and copies of the governor's proposed order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Not later than 10 days after the submission of the order to the appropriations committees, each appropriation committee by vote of a majority of its members elected and serving shall approve or disapprove the order. Expenditures authorized by appropriations shall not be reduced unless approved by both appropriations committees. Upon approval by both appropriations committees, the director shall implement the order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If either appropriation committee disapproves the order, the order is without force and effect. Not later than 30 days after a proposed order is disapproved, the governor may give reasonable written notice of the time and place of a further joint meeting of the appropriations committees, at which time the governor shall submit another order reducing expenditures authorized by appropriations. Within 10 days after the receipt of that order by the appropriations committees, each appropriations committee, by a majority of its members elected and serving, shall approve or disapprove the order. Upon approval by both appropriations committees, the director shall implement the order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   After the approval by both appropriations committees pursuant to subsection (3) or (4), a copy of the order of the governor and resolutions of both appropriations committees approving it shall be filed with the secretary of state and the order shall become effective.</DIV>

The state budget director shall issue directives to implement this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Issue directives regarding internal control over payment processing as will enable the state budget director to certify to the state treasurer that the system of internal control is sufficient to ensure that the proposed payment is properly authorized and is not in excess of the unexpended or unencumbered balance of the appropriation. Except for investment transactions, lottery prize awards, and refund of taxes, a payment shall not be made from the state treasury except upon certification of the state budget director.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Issue directives for the refund to payers of money which has been deposited in the state treasury through misunderstanding, inadvertence, or mistake and to which the state does not have a claim.

Changes in generally accepted accounting principles which require budgetary revisions shall be incorporated not later than the next executive budget after the change is issued. The state budget director shall issue directives to incorporate any changes, additions, and rescissions made to the generally accepted accounting principles as they affect the accounting of state government. If an item is not covered by an existing generally accepted accounting principle, the state budget director shall issue a directive which shall not be effective until 30 days after the directive is reported to the appropriations committee and the auditor general.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The state budget office shall not change an accounting principle, or the application of an accounting principle, from that which was followed in the preceding fiscal year if the change will materially affect the final year-end balance of an appropriated operating fund, unless the change in the accounting principle or the application of the accounting principle is reported to the senate and house appropriations committees not later than 120 days after the end of the fiscal year for which the change is to be implemented. However, the 120-day notice requirement shall not apply to a change in an accounting principle or the application of an accounting principle which is implemented to conform with requirements promulgated by the governmental accounting standards board, or its successor.</div>
