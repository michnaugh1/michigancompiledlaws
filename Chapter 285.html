These growth cracks seriously damage the tomato when they are not well healed, or when they are more than 1 inch in length, not to exceed 3 cracks to the tomato, except that very narrow well healed cracks concentric to the stem scar shall not be considered as serious damage unless they are so numerous as to seriously damage the appearance of the tomato.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   "Similar varietal characteristics" means that the tomatoes are alike as to firmness of flesh and shade of color, i.e., that soft-fleshed early maturing varieties are not mixed with firm-fleshed mid-season or late varieties, and that bright red varieties are not mixed with varieties having a purplish tinge.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A grain dealer shall file an application for a new license or for renewal or amendment of a license with the department. The department may determine the time when an application is filed and the form of the application. A complete application must include all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The name and ownership interest of each owner, stockholder, member, or partner of the grain dealer who owns at least 5% of the shares, other than publicly traded shares, or other ownership interests of the grain dealer, or for a grain dealer described in section 9(3), at least 5% of the shares, other than publicly traded shares, or other ownership interests of the parent corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The location and storage capacity of each facility of the grain dealer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Proof of insurance for all farm produce stored at each facility of the grain dealer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A statement that none of the events described in section 10 have occurred within the 5 years preceding the date of the license application, or if any of those events have occurred, a description of those events.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A statement of the total bushels of farm produce handled by the grain dealer during the grain dealer's most recent completed fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) If the grain dealer's most recent completed fiscal year was for a period of less than 12 months or the grain dealer materially changed its farm produce handling practices in that fiscal year, a projection of the total bushels of farm produce the grain dealer expects to handle in the current fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Copies of all warehouse receipt forms, price later agreement forms, and acknowledgment forms used by the grain dealer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Copies of all of the grain dealer's facility lease agreements and bin charts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the grain dealer does not maintain an office in this state and does not have a resident agent in this state, the application must include a written appointment of a statutory agent upon whom process, notice, or demand may be served. The statutory agent must be an individual residing in this state or a corporation whose principal place of business is located in this state. If the identity or address of the statutory agent changes while the application is pending or after a license is issued, the grain dealer shall within 3 days file with the department a written appointment of the new statutory agent or written notice of the new address, as applicable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) The license fee described in section 8. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) The financial statement described in section 9.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If an application described in subsection (1) is considered incomplete by the department, the department shall notify the applicant in writing or electronically not more than 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The 60-day time period described in subsection (6) is tolled upon notification by the department of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the department. The determination of the completeness of an application does not operate as an approval of the application for the license and does not confer eligibility of an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license. The tolling of the 60-day time period under this subsection does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and that application, upon completion, must be placed in sequence with other complete applications received at that same time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For a license renewal, a licensee shall submit the complete application to the department not less than 30 days before the expiration of the current license term unless the department issues a temporary permit to the licensee under section 6.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If an application is withdrawn before a license or renewal is approved, the department shall retain $50.00 for processing and return the remainder of the license fee to the grain dealer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) By submitting an application, a grain dealer consents to inspection and auditing of its farm produce and financial records and its operations by the department. The grain dealer shall make the records available to the department in this state if the department makes a request to inspect or audit the records.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The department shall issue or deny an initial or renewal license not more than 60 days after the department receives a complete application from an applicant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the department fails to issue or deny a license within the time required by this section, the department shall return the license fee and shall reduce the license fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based on the fact that the license fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The director of the department shall submit a report by December 1 of each year to the standing committees and appropriations subcommittees of the senate and house of representatives concerned with agricultural issues. The director shall include all of the following information in the report concerning the preceding fiscal year:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The number of initial and renewal applications the department received and completed within the 60-day time period described in subsection (6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The number of applications denied.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The number of applicants not issued a license within the 60-day time period and the amount of money returned to licensees and registrants under subsection (7).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Every year, the department may adjust the fee schedule in subsection (1) by an amount determined by the state treasurer to reflect the cumulative annual percentage change in the Detroit consumer price index over the 1-year period. An adjustment under this subsection shall not exceed 5% even if the amount determined by the state treasurer to reflect the cumulative annual percentage change over the 1-year period is more than 5%. A fee adjusted under this subsection shall be rounded to the nearest $5.00 increment. As used in this subsection, "Detroit consumer price index" means the most comprehensive index of consumer prices available for the Detroit area from the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of labor.</div>

<P>Sec. 12.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A licensee shall maintain on file with the department a current certificate of insurance evidencing an effective policy of insurance issued by an insurance company authorized to do business in this state. The policy shall insure in the name of the grain dealer all farm produce in the facilities of the grain dealer for the full market value of the farm produce against loss by fire, explosion, lightning, and windstorm. In addition to any other remedy available under this act, the department may deny, revoke, or suspend a license for a violation of this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If fire, explosion, lightning, or windstorm destroys or damages any farm produce in a facility operated by a licensee, and the depositor of the farm produce demands reimbursement and provides the licensee with a warehouse receipt or other evidence of ownership of the farm produce, the licensee shall reimburse the depositor of the farm produce for the market price of the farm produce minus any charges or advances to the depositor. As used in this subsection, "market price" means the average price paid for farm produce of the same type, grade, and quality on the date of the loss at the location of the facility.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A grain dealer shall reimburse all depositors whose farm produce is destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, lightning, or windstorm, within 10 days after the licensee receives payment from an insurer under a policy described in subsection (1). In addition to any other remedy available under this act, the department may deny, revoke, or suspend a license for a violation of this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the department determines that a licensee's insurance is insufficient, even if the insurance was previously acceptable to the department, the department shall require that the licensee obtain additional insurance that conforms to the requirements of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   An insurance company may not cancel or nonrenew insurance required by this act, including insurance provided by binder, unless it sends a notice of intent to cancel or nonrenew to the department by certified or registered mail more than 15 days before the cancellation or nonrenewal of the insurance is effective.</DIV>

If a substitute warehouse receipt or acknowledgment form is issued under this subsection, it has the same legal effect as the original warehouse receipt or acknowledgment form and the issuance of the substitute cancels the original warehouse receipt or acknowledgment form. A substitute warehouse receipt or acknowledgment form shall state the number and date of the original warehouse receipt or acknowledgment form; shall contain a notarized statement by the holder that the original was lost, stolen, or destroyed; and shall contain a notarized statement of the holder and grain dealer that the substitute warehouse receipt or acknowledgment form contains the same terms as and is issued to replace the original warehouse receipt or acknowledgment form. If the lost, stolen, or destroyed instrument is a negotiable warehouse receipt, the holder shall provide the grain dealer with a lost instrument bond in an amount equal to 2 times the current market value of the farm produce covered by that warehouse receipt, in a form prescribed by the department from a surety authorized to conduct business in this state.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Each of the following has a lien on all of the farm produce assets of a grain dealer:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A lender or other claimant that possesses a warehouse receipt that covers farm produce owned or stored by the grain dealer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A claimant that possesses a written acknowledgement or other written evidence of ownership of farm produce, other than a warehouse receipt, that establishes that the grain dealer has a storage obligation for the farm produce.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A claimant that surrendered a warehouse receipt as part of a farm produce sales transaction, if the claimant was not paid in full for the farm produce and the grain dealer failed within 21 days after the surrender of the warehouse receipt.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A claimant that possesses any other written evidence of the sale of farm produce to the grain dealer for which the claimant was not paid in full.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) All of the following apply to a lien that exists under subsection (1):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The lien secures all claims described in subsection (3) and attaches to the farm produce assets of the grain dealer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The lien takes effect at the time the farm produce is delivered to the grain dealer for sale or storage under a bailment agreement or at the time money is advanced by the lender.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The lien terminates at the time the liability of the grain dealer to the claimant is discharged. However, the priority of each lien among the respective claimants does not relate to the date the claim arises but is subject to the priorities described in subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) In the event of a failure of a grain dealer, the lien claims of all claimants of that grain dealer are considered assigned by operation of this section to the department, and in the event of a failure and subsequent liquidation, the lien attaches to assets or proceeds of assets that are either received or liquidated by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as provided in subsection (4), and subject to subsection (6), in the event of a failure of a grain dealer, the director shall enforce the claims of each lienholder under this section against the farm produce assets of the grain dealer and allocate the proceeds as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The director shall give first priority to allocating the proceeds equally to claimants described in subsection (1)(a), (b), and (c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If any proceeds remain after satisfying the claims described in subdivision (a), the director shall give second priority to allocating the remaining proceeds first to claimants that possess secured price later agreements and then to all remaining claimants that possess price later agreements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If any proceeds remain after satisfying the claims described in subdivisions (a) and (b), the director shall give third priority to allocating the remaining proceeds to claimants that possess acknowledgment forms, similar farm produce delivery contracts, or other written evidence of the sale of farm produce and that completed delivery and pricing of the farm produce in the 30-day period preceding the date of the failure of the grain dealer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If any proceeds remain after satisfying the claims described in subdivisions (a) to (c), the director shall give fourth priority to allocating the remaining proceeds on a pro rata basis to all other claimants that possess written evidence of the sale of farm produce to the grain dealer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If any proceeds remain after satisfying the claims described in subdivisions (a) to (d), the director shall distribute those proceeds jointly to the grain dealer and any secured parties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In the event that an adversary proceeding is commenced to recover farm produce assets on which a lien described in this section is attached and the department declines to enter the proceeding, the director, if he or she receives an application from a claimant that holds a lien under this section, shall assign to the claimant the applicable lien to permit the claimant to pursue the claimant's lien in the adversary proceeding, to the extent that assignment will not delay the resolution of the proceeding, the prompt liquidation of the assets, or the ultimate distribution of the assets of all claimants.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) In the event of the failure of a grain dealer, the department shall liquidate the farm produce assets of the grain dealer to satisfy valid claims of claimants described in subsection (3) by taking possession of all farm produce in the grain dealer facility, distributing or selling the farm produce, and distributing the proceeds under subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The director may reduce the amount of a claim described in this section to reflect the liabilities owed to the grain dealer by the claimant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A lien that exists under subsection (1) has priority over a conflicting security interest in or agricultural lien on the same collateral, except that a conflicting security interest or agricultural lien on the collateral that is perfected on the effective date of this section has priority over a lien that exists under subsection (1) for a period of 1 year after the effective date of this section.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 28.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Before a license is issued to a grain merchandiser or farm produce trucker, the grain merchandiser or farm produce trucker shall provide a bond to the department in the amount of $100,000.00.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A bond provided under this section shall name the department as payee, be executed by the applicant as principal, and be issued by a surety authorized to conduct business in this state. The department shall prescribe the form and terms and conditions of the bond.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A bond provided under this section shall secure the faithful performance of the grain merchandiser or farm produce trucker of his or her obligations in any farm produce transaction outstanding on or after the effective date of the bond and outstanding at the time the license of the grain merchandiser or farm produce trucker is revoked or the bond is canceled as provided in this act, whichever occurs first. The bond shall secure the faithful performance by the grain merchandiser or farm produce trucker of those obligations whether the grain merchandiser or farm produce trucker is licensed or not.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The total aggregate liability of a surety under a bond provided under this section is limited to the amount of the bond without regard to the number of claimants involved in a transaction in which a claim on the bond is made. The liability of a surety on a bond provided under this section shall not accumulate for any successive license period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A grain merchandiser or farm produce trucker required to provide a bond to the department under this section may at his or her option provide the department with a certificate of deposit or other security acceptable to the department in lieu of all or part of the bond, payable to the department as trustee. The principal amount of the certificate of deposit or other security provided, or the aggregate amount of the bond provided and the principal amount of the certificate of deposit or other security provided, shall be the same as the amount of the bond otherwise required under this section. The interest on the certificate of deposit or other security provided under this subsection shall be made payable to the grain merchandiser or farm produce trucker or other purchaser of the certificate of deposit or other security. The certificate of deposit or other security shall remain on deposit until it is released, canceled, or discharged as provided for by rule of the department. The provisions of this section that apply to a bond required under this section apply to a certificate of deposit or other security provided under this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If the department determines that a bond previously provided under this section is insufficient, the department shall require that the grain merchandiser or farm produce trucker provide an additional bond. The additional bond shall be in an amount determined by the department and conform with all other requirements of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A grain merchandiser or farm produce trucker shall not cancel a bond required by this section without the consent of the department and the department's prior approval of a substitute bond.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The surety on a bond required by this section may not cancel the bond unless it sends a notice of intent to cancel to the department more than 60 days before it cancels the bond. If the department receives a notice from a surety under this subsection, it shall promptly notify the grain merchandiser or farm produce trucker that provided the bond. The department shall revoke the license of a grain merchandiser or farm produce trucker who fails to provide a new bond within 60 days after the department receives notice of intent to cancel from a surety.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 9.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The authority shall develop a beginning farmer loan program to facilitate the acquisition of agricultural land, agricultural improvements, and depreciable agricultural property by beginning farmers. The authority shall exercise the powers granted to it in this act to fulfill the goal of providing financial assistance to beginning farmers in the acquisition of agricultural land, agricultural improvements, and depreciable agricultural property. The authority may participate in and cooperate with programs of the farmers home administration, federal land bank, or other agency or instrumentality of the federal government, or with any program of another state agency in the administration of the beginning farmer loan program and in the making or purchasing of mortgage or secured loans pursuant to this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The authority shall provide in a beginning farmer loan program that a mortgage or secured loan to or on behalf of a beginning farmer shall be provided only if all of the following are satisfied:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The beginning farmer is a resident of this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The agricultural land, agricultural improvements, or depreciable agricultural property the beginning farmer proposes to purchase will be located in this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The beginning farmer has sufficient education, training, ability, or experience in the type of farming for which the beginning farmer requests the mortgage or secured loan. The authority shall give preference to beginning farmers that have on-farm experience.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The authority is financing the acquisition by that beginning farmer of agricultural land and agricultural improvements totaling not more than $400,000.00 in value or of depreciable agricultural property totaling not more than $125,000.00 in value.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   If the loan is for the acquisition of agricultural land, the beginning farmer has or will have access to adequate working capital, farm equipment, machinery, or livestock to commence or continue farming. If the loan is for the acquisition of depreciable agricultural property, the beginning farmer has or will have access to adequate working capital or agricultural land to commence or continue farming.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The beginning farmer has a low or moderate net worth.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   If the loan is for the acquisition of agricultural land, the beginning farmer executes, at the time of closing on the loan, an application for enrollment of the land in part 361 (farmland and open space preservation) of the natural resources and environmental protection act, Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.36101 to 324.36117 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   The agricultural land and agricultural improvements will only be used for farming by the beginning farmer or his or her family.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The beginning farmer has not previously received financing under the program for the acquisition of property similar in nature to the property for which the loan is sought, except that this restriction shall not apply if the amount previously received plus the amount of the loan sought does not exceed $400,000.00 in the case of agricultural land and improvements or $125,000.00 in the case of depreciable agricultural property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)   Other criteria as the authority prescribes by rule.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The authority may include in a mortgage or secured loan made or purchased pursuant to this act a provision that allows the authority, at its option, to accelerate and declare immediately due and payable all sums secured by the authority's lien or security interest if all or a part of the agricultural land, agricultural improvements, or depreciable agricultural property securing the loan is leased, sold, or otherwise transferred. The authority may provide by rule the standards for permitted assumptions of a mortgage or for the lease, sale, or other transfer of an interest in the agricultural land, agricultural improvement, or depreciable agricultural property.

Mortgage lenders are authorized to borrow from the authority pursuant to this section and the rules promulgated by the authority.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The authority shall require as a condition of a loan to a mortgage lender that the mortgage lender, within a reasonable period after receipt of the loan proceeds as the authority prescribes by rule, enter into written commitments to make and, within a reasonable period thereafter as the authority prescribes by rule, disburse the loan proceeds in new mortgage or secured loans to beginning farmers in an aggregate principal amount of not less than the amount of the loan. New mortgage or secured loans shall have terms and conditions as the authority prescribes by rules which are reasonably related to implementing the purposes of this act. The authority shall require a mortgage lender to which the authority has made a loan to submit evidence satisfactory to the authority that the mortgage lender has made new mortgage or secured loans to beginning farmers as required by this section.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The interest rate and other terms of loans to mortgage lenders made from the proceeds of an issue of bonds or notes of the authority shall be at least sufficient to assure the payment of the bonds or notes and the interest on them as they become due. In addition, the authority may require that loans to mortgage lenders are additionally secured as to payment of both principal and interest by a pledge of and lien upon collateral security by special escrow funds or other forms of guarantee and in amounts and forms as the authority by resolution determines to be necessary to assure the payment of the loans and the interest as they become due. Collateral security shall consist of any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Obligations or securities of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States or any of the agencies of the United States, or for which the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 20.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The authority shall create and establish 1 or more special funds to secure notes and bonds of the authority, referred to in this act as capital reserve funds. The authority shall pay into a capital reserve fund money appropriated and made available by this state for the purposes of the fund; the proceeds of the sale of notes or bonds, to the extent provided in the resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of the notes or bonds; and other money which is made available to the authority for the purpose of a fund from any other source. All money held in any capital reserve fund, except as specifically provided, shall be used as required solely for the payment of the principal of bonds of the authority secured in whole or in part by the capital reserve fund, for the purchase or redemption of bonds, for the payment of interest on the bonds, or for the payment of a redemption premium required to be paid when the bonds are redeemed prior to maturity. However, the authority shall not use the money for an optional purchase or optional redemption of bonds if that use would reduce the amount of money on deposit in a capital reserve fund to less than the capital reserve fund requirements established for the fund. Any income or interest earned by, or increment to, a capital reserve fund due to the investment of the money in the capital reserve fund may be transferred by the authority to other funds or accounts of the authority to the extent that the transfer does not reduce the amount of a capital reserve fund below the capital reserve fund requirement for a fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The authority shall not issue bonds secured in whole or in part by a capital reserve fund if, upon the issuance of the bonds, the amount in the capital reserve fund would be less than the capital reserve fund requirement for the fund, unless the authority, at the time of issuance of the bonds, deposits in the fund from the proceeds of the bonds to be issued, or from other sources, an amount which, together with the amount then in the fund, is not less than the capital reserve fund requirement for the fund. As used in this section, "capital reserve fund requirement" means the requirement provided in the resolution of the authority authorizing the bonds with respect to which the fund is established, which amount shall not exceed the maximum amount of principal and interest maturing and becoming due in a succeeding calendar year on the bonds of the authority secured in whole or in part by the fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The authority shall not have outstanding at any time bonds and notes for its corporate purposes in an aggregate principal amount exceeding $100,000,000.00, excluding bonds and notes issued to refund outstanding bonds and notes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In computing the amount of a capital reserve fund for the purposes of this section, securities in which all or a portion of the fund is invested shall be valued at par. If the securities are purchased at other than par, the securities may be valued at their cost to the authority, as adjusted by amortization of the discount or premium paid upon purchase of the securities on a pro rata basis to the maturity date of the securities.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to subsection (2), a producer that satisfies any of the following conditions is eligible to make a claim for reimbursement from the fund under this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The producer possesses written evidence of ownership of farm produce that discloses a storage obligation of a licensee that has failed, including, but not limited to, a warehouse receipt, acknowledgment form, or settlement sheet.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The producer has surrendered warehouse receipts as part of a sale of farm produce to a licensee that failed not more than 21 days after the surrender of the warehouse receipts and the producer surrendering the warehouse receipts was not fully paid for the farm produce.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The producer possesses written evidence of the delivery and sale of farm produce or transfer of price later farm produce to a failed licensee, including, but not limited to, an acknowledgment form, settlement sheet, price later agreement, or similar farm produce delivery contract, but the grain dealer did not pay the producer in full for the farm produce.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A producer is not eligible for reimbursement from the fund for a claim submitted under this section if any of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The producer previously requested a refund from the fund under section 13 and the producer did not previously reenter the program under section 13(5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The claim relates to delivery of farm produce to a licensee that is a cooperative association, under the terms of an agreement between the producer and the licensee that allocated delivery rights and obligations proportionate to a capital investment of the producer in the licensee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) At the time the claim is submitted, excluding patronage interests, the producer is the owner of at least 5% of the voting shares, other than publicly traded shares, membership interests, partnership interests, or other ownership interests of the licensee whose failure is the basis of the claim. As used in this subdivision, "patronage interests" means shares or membership, partnership, or other ownership interests in a licensee that is a cooperative association that are allocated and distributed to the producer in proportion to that producer's patronage of the cooperative association.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) At the time the claim is submitted, the producer is the owner of at least 5% of the voting shares, other than publicly traded shares, membership interests, partnership interests, or other ownership interests of the parent corporation of the licensee whose failure is the basis of the claim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Title to the farm produce that is the subject of the claim was transferred by the producer more than 18 months before the date the claim is submitted. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) If notice of the failure of the licensee was published in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in which a facility of the licensee was located, the claim is submitted more than 1 year after that publication.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the department finds a claim made under subsection (1) is valid and the board approves of the valid claim, the board shall within 90 days of the board's approval pay the claimant the amount described in subsection (4) or (5) from the fund as compensation for the claim. The 90-day time period for payment may be extended if the board and claimant agree in a writing that describes the payment terms and schedule.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A claimant that incurs a storage loss due to the failure of a licensee is entitled to payment under subsection (3) in an amount equal to 100% of the storage loss, less any administrative premium or producer premium that would have been due on the sale of the farm produce. The department shall determine the gross amount of the storage loss based on local market prices on the date of failure. The department may consider any evidence submitted by the failed licensee or any claimants concerning the actual charges associated with stored farm produce.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A claimant that incurs a financial loss due to the failure of a licensee is entitled to payment under subsection (3) in an amount equal to 90% of the financial loss. For farm produce that is sold in a transaction subject to the grain dealers act, the department shall determine the amount of the financial loss based on the value of the farm produce less any outstanding charges against the farm produce. If the farm produce has not been priced, the department shall establish the amount of the financial loss using the local market on the date of failure less any usual and customary charges associated with the sale of farm produce.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The board may require a claimant paid under this section for a valid claim to subrogate to the board or authority all the claimant's rights to collect on any bond issued under the grain dealers act or the United States warehouse act, 7 USC 241 to 256, and the claimant's rights to any other compensation arising from the failure of the licensee. If required to subrogate under this subsection, the claimant shall assign the claimant's interest in any judgment concerning the failure to the board or authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The board shall deny the payment of a valid claim under this section if the board determines any of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The claimant as payee fails to present for payment a negotiable instrument issued as payment for farm produce within 90 days after the date the negotiable instrument is tendered to the claimant as payment for farm produce purchased by the licensee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The claimant has engaged in marketing or management practices that have contributed to the claimant's loss. The authority may consider whether the marketing or management practices are generally accepted marketing or management practices in this state in making its determination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The claimant has intentionally committed a fraud or violated this act in connection with the claim.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The department shall provide indemnification for the death, injury, or loss of livestock from wolves, coyotes, and cougars.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Within 45 days after receipt of a claim for indemnification, the department shall appraise and inventory the livestock for which indemnification is sought and shall make an indemnification payment to a person who is eligible to receive indemnification under this act. If the department fails to make the indemnification payment within this 45-day time period, the person is entitled to receive from the department twice the amount of the original claim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the department shall reimburse the claimant, for each animal included in the claim, 100% of the fair market value, on the date of the appraisal, of livestock of that type marketable for the purpose for which the animal was intended to be marketed, not to exceed $4,000.00 for each animal. The appraisal determination shall not delay the slaughter, destruction, or disposition of the livestock animals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The department shall deduct from the indemnification amount under subsection (2) for any compensation received, or to be received by the owner, from any other source, including, but not limited to, indemnification by the United States department of agriculture, insurance, or salvage value.

An affidavit signed by the owner attesting to the amount of compensation for the livestock received, or to be received, from any other source shall accompany the appraisal certificate prior to the payment of indemnification under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The department may make an indemnification payment pursuant to this section not to exceed $100,000.00 per incident which is the basis for a valid claim for indemnification under this act, from any line item in the annual budget for the department in the applicable fiscal year. Any agreement for an indemnification payment greater than $100,000.00 entered into between the department and an owner of livestock shall contain a provision indicating that, notwithstanding the terms of the agreement, indemnification shall be subject to specific appropriations by the legislature and not be paid from department funds.</div>
