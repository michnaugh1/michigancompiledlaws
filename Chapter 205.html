The department has the power and authority incidental to the performance of the following acts, duties, and services:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The state treasurer or a duly appointed agent of the state treasurer may examine the books, records, and papers touching the matter at issue of any person or taxpayer subject to any tax, unpaid account, or money the collection of which is charged to the department.

The state treasurer or a duly appointed agent, referee, or examiner of the state treasurer may administer an oath to a witness in any matter before the department. The department may invoke the aid of the circuit court of this state in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the producing of books, papers, and documents. The circuit court of this state within the jurisdiction of which an inquiry is carried on, in case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, may issue an order requiring the person to appear before the department and produce books and papers if so ordered and any evidence touching the matter in question, and failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt. A person shall not be excused from testifying or from producing any books, papers, records, or memoranda in any investigation, or upon any hearing when ordered to do so by the state treasurer, upon the ground that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, may tend to incriminate or subject him or her to a criminal penalty, however, a person shall not be prosecuted or subjected to any criminal penalty for or on account of any transaction made or thing concerning which he or she may testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, before the department or its agent.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The department may investigate and study all matters of taxation and revenue as the basis of recommending to the governor and the legislature those changes and alterations in the tax laws of this state, as in the state treasurer's judgment may bring about a more adequate and just system of state and local taxation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The department may formulate a standard procedure that requires the departments, commissions, boards, institutions, and the agencies of this state that collect taxes, fees, or accounts for this state to report all sums of money due and uncollected and those uncollected items as prescribed by law and by the state treasurer. The procedure prescribed in this subdivision shall include a standard practice for receiving, receipting, safeguarding, and periodically reporting all state revenue receipts, whether current, delinquent, penalty, interest, or otherwise, and the amounts, kinds, and terms of items either collected, compromised, or still outstanding, to be summarized, studied, and reported upon as the state treasurer considers advisable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The department may periodically issue bulletins that index and explain current department interpretations of current state tax laws. Beginning October 22, 2003, each bulletin or letter ruling issued by the department on or after August 18, 2000 shall be published and made available to the public in printed and electronic formats.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) For reporting periods beginning after August 31, 1991, a taxpayer other than a city or a county who paid in the immediately preceding calendar year an average of $40,000.00 or more per month in income tax withholding pursuant to the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.1 to 206.713, shall deposit Michigan income tax withholding either in the same manner and according to the same schedule as deposits of federal income tax withholding or in another manner that has been approved by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For failure to remit a tax administered by this act with a negotiable remittance, the following penalty may be added in addition to any other penalties imposed by this act: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For notices of intent to assess issued on or before February 28, 2003, 25% of the tax due.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For notices of intent to assess issued after February 28, 2003, $50.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The department may require that all money collected by the taxpayer for taxes administered by this act that has not been paid to the department is public money and the property of this state, and shall be held in trust in a separate account and fund for the sole use and benefit of this state until paid over to the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) For tax years after the 1995 tax year for which taxes are collected under an agreement entered into pursuant to section 9 of chapter 1 of the city income tax act, 1964 PA 284, MCL 141.509, if a taxpayer pays, when filing his or her annual return, an amount less than the sum of the declared tax liability under the city income tax act, 1964 PA 284, MCL 141.501 to 141.787, and the declared tax liability under the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.1 to 206.713, and if there is no indication of the allocation of payment between the tax liabilities against which the payment should be applied, the amount paid shall first be applied against the taxpayer's tax liability under the city income tax act, 1964 PA 284, MCL 141.501 to 141.787, and any remaining amount of the payment shall be applied to the taxpayer's tax liability under the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.1 to 206.713. The taxpayer's designation of a payee on a payment is not a dispositive determination of the allocation of that payment under this subsection.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a taxpayer fails or refuses to make a return or payment as required, in whole or in part, or if the department has reason to believe that a return made or payment does not supply sufficient information for an accurate determination of the amount of tax due, the department may obtain information on which to base an assessment of the tax. By its duly authorized agents, the department may examine the books, records, and papers and audit the accounts of a person or any other records pertaining to the tax. A taxpayer who has been audited by the department or its agent or a taxpayer whose books, records, and papers have been examined by the department shall, upon request, be provided a complete copy in printed or electronic format of the complete audit work papers and the audit report of findings. Any audit performed by the department or its duly authorized agents under section 3(a) shall be performed in accordance with auditing standards which shall include, but are not limited to, confidentiality, technical training, independence, due professional care, planning, supervision, understanding of the entity audited including internal control and an assessment of risk, audit evidence and documentation, sampling and sampling projections, and elements of the audit report of findings. The department shall promulgate administrative rules on audit standards within 1 year of the date of enactment of the amendatory act that added this sentence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In carrying out this section, the department and the taxpayer shall comply with the following procedure:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The department shall send to the taxpayer a letter of inquiry stating, in a courteous and nonintimidating manner, the department's opinion that the taxpayer needs to furnish further information or owes taxes to the state, and the reason for that opinion. A letter of inquiry shall also explain the procedure by which the person may initiate communication with the department to resolve any dispute. This subdivision does not apply in any of the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The taxpayer files a return showing a tax due and fails to pay that tax.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The deficiency resulted from an audit of the taxpayer's books and records by this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The taxpayer otherwise affirmatively admits that a tax is due and owing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days after the department sends the taxpayer a letter of inquiry or if a letter of inquiry is not required pursuant to subdivision (a), the department, after determining the amount of tax due from a taxpayer, shall give notice to the taxpayer of its intent to assess the tax. The notice shall include the amount of the tax the department believes the taxpayer owes, the reason for that deficiency, and a statement advising the taxpayer of a right to an informal conference, the requirement of a written request by the taxpayer for the informal conference that includes the taxpayer's statement of the contested amounts and an explanation of the dispute, and the 60-day time limit for that request.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the taxpayer serves written notice upon the department within 60 days after the taxpayer receives a notice of intent to assess, remits the uncontested portion of the liability, and provides a statement of the contested amounts and an explanation of the dispute, the taxpayer is entitled to an informal conference on the question of liability for the assessment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Upon receipt of a taxpayer's written notice, the department shall set a mutually agreed upon or reasonable time and place for the informal conference and shall give the taxpayer reasonable written notice not less than 20 days before the informal conference. The notice shall specify the intent to assess, type of tax, and tax year that is the subject of the informal conference. The informal conference provided for by this subdivision is not subject to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, but is subject to the rules governing informal conferences as promulgated by the department in accordance with the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328. The taxpayer may appear or be represented by any person before the department at an informal conference, and may present testimony and argument. At the party's own expense and with advance notice to the other party, a taxpayer or the department, or both, may make an audio recording of an informal conference. A taxpayer who has made a timely request for an informal conference may at any time withdraw that request by filing written notice with the department. Upon receipt of the request for withdrawal from the informal conference process, the department shall issue a decision and order of determination and, where appropriate, a final assessment, from which a taxpayer may seek an appeal as provided under section 22.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) After a timely request for an informal conference has been made under subdivision (c), the taxpayer and the department may seek to settle any or all issues in dispute by submitting a written settlement offer to the other party in accordance with the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The taxpayer shall submit a written settlement offer no later than 21 days after the informal conference. The settlement offer must identify the issues in dispute to be settled, the amount of the settlement offer, and the factual and legal bases supporting the taxpayer's settlement offer, and include any supporting documents. The state treasurer or the state treasurer's designee or designees shall review the settlement offer and the department's recommendation regarding the offer. The state treasurer or the state treasurer's designee or designees shall determine whether to accept, reject, or counter the settlement offer. The department shall notify the taxpayer in writing of the department's acceptance, rejection, or counter-offer. If the department does not accept the taxpayer's offer, the department shall include in its written notification the factual and legal bases for the department's rejection or counter-offer. The taxpayer may accept, reject, or counter the department's counter-offer and proceed in accordance with subparagraph (iii).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The informal conference referee or the administrator of the department's hearings division or its successor unit may submit a written report to the state treasurer or the state treasurer's designee or designees that identifies the relevant facts and issues involved in the dispute, the factual and legal bases supporting settlement of any or all of the issues, and a settlement recommendation. Doubt as to collectability shall not be a reason for settlement under this subdivision. If the state treasurer or the state treasurer's designee or designees determines to pursue a settlement, the department shall notify the taxpayer in writing of the department's settlement offer, to be determined by the state treasurer or the state treasurer's designee or designees. The department's written settlement offer shall include the factual and legal bases supporting the department's settlement offer. The taxpayer, in writing, may accept, reject, or counter the department's settlement offer and proceed in accordance with subparagraph (iii).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If the department rejects the taxpayer's settlement offer or counter-offer or the taxpayer rejects the department's settlement offer or counter-offer, the informal conference process shall proceed as provided under this section unless the taxpayer files a written notice to withdraw the request for an informal conference as provided in subdivision (d). If the department accepts the taxpayer's settlement offer or counter-offer or the taxpayer accepts the department's settlement offer or counter-offer, the department and the taxpayer shall execute a written agreement outlining all of the terms of the settlement. If the agreement settles all of the issues in dispute, then the written agreement is also the taxpayer's written notice to withdraw its request for an informal conference. Then the department shall, where appropriate, issue a final assessment that reflects the agreement and the agreed-upon amount of liability as to the settled issues. The department's final assessment issued under this subdivision is not subject to challenge or appeal under this act or reviewable in any court by mandamus, appeal, or other method of direct or collateral attack. With respect to any issues in dispute that are not included in the settlement agreement, the informal conference process shall proceed as provided under this section unless the taxpayer files a written notice to withdraw the request for an informal conference as provided in subdivision (d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The taxpayer's and the department's settlement offers, counter-offers, and responses to those offers and counter-offers, the disposition of a settlement offer or counter-offer under this subdivision, and settlement agreements, may not be offered by any party in any proceeding before the Michigan tax tribunal, the court of claims, or any court of competent jurisdiction as proof of the validity of the department's decision, order, or assessment, or of the proper amount of the taxpayer's tax liability.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Settlement offers, counter-offers, responses thereto, settlement agreements, and reports of the informal conference referee, the administrator, or the department related to settlements under this subdivision are exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246, and may not be obtained through discovery in any proceeding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Except for those issues that were settled pursuant to subdivision (e), after the informal conference, the department shall render a decision and order in writing, setting forth the reasons and authority, and shall assess the tax, interest, and penalty found to be due and payable. The decision and order are limited to the subject of the informal conference as included in the notice under subdivision (d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) If the taxpayer does not protest the notice of intent to assess within the time provided in subdivision (c), the department may assess the tax and the interest and penalty on the tax that the department believes are due and payable. An assessment under this subdivision or subdivision (f) is final and subject to appeal as provided in section 22. The final notice of assessment shall include a statement advising the person of a right to appeal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If as a result of an audit it is determined that a taxpayer is owed a refund, the department shall send a notice to the taxpayer stating the amount of the refund the department believes is owed to the taxpayer as a result of the audit. The notice shall inform the taxpayer of his or her appeal rights. If the taxpayer disputes the findings of the audit, the taxpayer may serve written notice upon the department in the same manner as provided for in subsection (2)(c) and the taxpayer is entitled to the same informal conference and subsequent appeals as provided for in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a protest to the notice of intent to assess the tax is determined by the department to be a frivolous protest or a desire by the taxpayer to delay or impede the administration of taxes administered under this act, a penalty of $25.00 or 25% of the amount of tax under protest, whichever is greater, shall be added to the tax.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) During the course of the informal conference under subsection (2)(d), the taxpayer by written notice may convert his or her contest of the assessment to a claim for a refund. The written notice shall be accompanied by payment of the contested amount. The informal conference shall continue and the department shall render a decision and issue an order regarding the claim for refund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For audits commenced after September 30, 2014, the department must complete fieldwork and provide a written preliminary audit determination for any tax period no later than 1 year after the period provided for in section 27a(2) without regard to the extension provided for in section 27a(3). The limitation described in this subsection does not apply to any tax period in which the department and the taxpayer agreed in writing to extend the statute of limitations described in section 27a(2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For audits commenced after September 30, 2014, unless otherwise agreed to by the department and the taxpayer, the final assessment issued under subsection (2)(g) must be issued within 9 months of the date that the department provided the taxpayer with a written preliminary audit determination unless the taxpayer, for any reason, requests reconsideration of the preliminary audit determination or the taxpayer requests an informal conference under subsection (2)(c). A request for reconsideration by a taxpayer permits, but does not require, the department to delay the issuance of a final assessment under subsection (2)(g).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The department shall publish semiannually on the department's website a report containing the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The aggregate amount of the department's original determinations of liability attributed to settlements entered into during the reporting period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The aggregate settled amount of liability attributed to the settlements entered into during the reporting period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the total number of settlements between taxpayers and the department entered into during the reporting period is 5 or more, include the actual number of settlements. If the number of settlements is less than 5, the department shall state "less than 5".</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, the settlement process established under subsection (2)(e) only applies to taxes subject to administration under this act. The settlement process established under subsection (2)(e) does not apply to matters arising under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, the state real estate transfer tax act, 1993 PA 330, MCL 207.521 to 207.537, the tobacco products tax act, 1993 PA 327, MCL 205.421 to 205.436, the health insurance claims assessment act, 2011 PA 142, MCL 550.1731 to 550.1741, and the city income tax act, 1964 PA 284, MCL 141.501 to 141.787.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 23.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the department believes, based upon either the examination of a tax return, a payment, or an audit authorized by this act, that a taxpayer has not satisfied a tax liability or that a claim was excessive, the department shall determine the tax liability and notify the taxpayer of that determination. A liability for a tax administered under this act is subject to the interest and penalties prescribed in subsections (2) to (5).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the amount of a tax paid is less than the amount that should have been paid or an excessive claim has been made, the deficiency and interest on the deficiency at the current monthly interest rate of 1 percentage point above the adjusted prime rate per annum from the time the tax was due, and until paid, are due and payable after notice and informal conference as provided in this act. A deficiency in an estimated payment as may be required by a tax statute administered under this act shall be treated in the same manner as a tax due and shall be subject to the same current monthly interest rate of 1 percentage point above the adjusted prime rate per annum from the time the payment was due, until paid. As used in this section, "adjusted prime rate" means the average predominant prime rate quoted by not less than 3 commercial banks to large businesses, as determined by the department of treasury. The adjusted prime rate is to be based on the average prime rate charged by not less than 3 commercial banks during the 6-month period ending on March 31 and the 6-month period ending on September 30. One percentage point shall be added to the adjusted prime rate, and the resulting sum shall be divided by 12 to establish the current monthly interest rate. The resulting current monthly interest rate based on the 6-month period ending March 31 becomes effective on the following July 1, and the resulting current monthly interest rate based on the 6-month period ending September 30 becomes effective on January 1 of the following year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as provided in subsection (4), if any part of the deficiency or an excessive claim for credit is due to negligence, but without intent to defraud, a penalty of $10.00 or 10% of the total amount of the deficiency in the tax, whichever is greater, plus interest as provided in subsection (2), shall be added. The penalty becomes due and payable after notice and informal conference as provided in this act. If a taxpayer subject to a penalty under this subsection demonstrates to the satisfaction of the department that the deficiency or excess claim for credit was due to reasonable cause, the department shall waive the penalty. The penalty prescribed by this subsection shall not be imposed after June 30, 1994 unless and until the department submits for public hearing pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, being sections 24.201 to 24.328 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, a rule defining what constitutes reasonable cause for waiver of the penalty under this subsection, which definition shall include illustrative examples.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If any part of the deficiency or an excessive claim for credit is due to intentional disregard of the law or of the rules promulgated by the department, but without intent to defraud, a penalty of $25.00 or 25% of the total amount of the deficiency in the tax, whichever is greater, plus interest as provided in subsection (2), shall be added. The penalty becomes due and payable after notice and informal conference as provided in this act. If a penalty is imposed under this subsection and the taxpayer subject to the penalty successfully disputes the penalty, the department shall not impose a penalty prescribed by subsection (3) to the tax otherwise due.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If any part of the deficiency or an excessive claim for credit is due to fraudulent intent to evade a tax, or to obtain a refund for a fraudulent claim, a penalty of 100% of the deficiency, plus interest as provided in subsection (2), shall be added. The penalty becomes due and payable after notice and informal conference as provided in this act.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Beginning January 1, 2015, the state treasurer, or an authorized representative of the state treasurer, may compromise all or any part of any payment of a tax subject to administration under this act including any related penalties and interest if 1 or more of the following grounds exist:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A doubt exists as to liability if the department concludes, based on evidence provided by the taxpayer, that the taxpayer would have prevailed in a contested case if the taxpayer's appeal rights had not expired.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A doubt exists as to collectability if the taxpayer establishes both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The amount offered in payment is the most that can be expected to be paid or collected from the taxpayer's present assets or income.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The taxpayer does not have reasonable prospects of acquiring increased income or assets that would enable the taxpayer to satisfy a greater amount of the liability than the amount offered, within a reasonable period of time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A federal compromise of tax under section 7122 of the internal revenue code has been granted for the same tax years. If an offer to compromise a tax under part 1 or part 2 of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.1 to 206.699, is accepted pursuant to this subdivision, the state treasurer, or an authorized representative of the state treasurer, may compromise the outstanding balance of the liability for each year by applying the same percentage as the federal liability compromised to the total liability.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the state treasurer, or an authorized representative of the state treasurer, compromises all or any part of any payment of a tax as authorized under this section, he or she shall place on file in the office of the state treasurer and publish on the department of treasury's website a written report outlining the basis for the compromise and, at a minimum, a statement of each of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The amount of tax assessed. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The amount of interest or assessable penalty imposed by law on the person against whom the tax is assessed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The terms of the compromise and the amount actually paid in accordance with the terms of the compromise.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The grounds for the compromise.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A compromise under this section is subject to continuing review by the state treasurer. The department may revoke any compromise made under this section, may reestablish all compromised liabilities, without regard to any statute of limitations that otherwise may be applicable, and shall not refund any portion of the amount offered in compromise, if either of the following occurs:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The state treasurer, or an authorized representative of the state treasurer, reasonably determines that the person receiving the compromise concealed from the department any property belonging to the taxpayer, the estate of a taxpayer, or any other person liable for the tax or, with the intent to mislead, withheld, destroyed, mutilated, or falsified any book, document, or record or made any false statement, relating to the estate or financial condition of the taxpayer or other person liable for the tax to induce the compromise.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The taxpayer fails to comply with any of the terms and conditions relative to the offer or to file subsequent required returns and pay subsequent final tax liabilities within 20 days after the department issues a notice and demand to the person stating that the continued failure to file or pay the tax may result in the revocation of the compromise made under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Within 180 days after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this section, the state treasurer shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Establish guidelines for the offer-in-compromise program authorized under this section. If appropriate, the guidelines shall be modeled after those guidelines published by the internal revenue service of the United States department of treasury in regards to the federal offer-in-compromise program established under section 7122 of the internal revenue code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Establish guidelines for officers and employees within the department to use when making decisions on whether an offer-in-compromise is appropriate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Establish procedures for an independent administrative review within the department of any rejection of a proposed offer-in-compromise made by the taxpayer. In order to initiate a review under this subdivision, the taxpayer shall make a written request on a form prescribed by the department within 30 days after the department issues the rejection. If appropriate, the independent administrative review procedures shall be modeled after the guidelines published by the internal revenue service for the federal offer-in-compromise program established under section 7122 of the internal revenue code. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The department shall disclose return information to members of the general public to the extent necessary to permit inspection of any accepted offer-in-compromise under this section relating to the liability for a tax imposed by this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Except for a revocation as provided under subsection (3), a tax that was compromised is not subject to additional assessment or collection unless the compromised tax is modified or adjusted as a result of information received from the internal revenue service or as a result of an audit performed by this state or on behalf of this state. Except as to any additional assessment imposed as provided under this subsection, a taxpayer shall not request an informal conference or institute tribunal or judicial proceeding against the department regarding the taxpayer's tax liability or the compromise.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The department shall not levy against property to collect a liability while an offer to compromise is pending unless the state treasurer, or an authorized representative of the state treasurer, has determined that the taxpayer's offer to compromise was intended to delay collection of the tax or the department has issued a jeopardy assessment under section 26.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A taxpayer who submits an offer to compromise a tax, penalty, or interest shall remit with its offer $100.00 or 20% of the offer, whichever is greater, to the department. The amount remitted with the offer shall be applied to the outstanding balance of that taxpayer's liability and shall not be refunded if the offer to compromise is rejected or reduced.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Except for the independent administrative review available as provided under subsection (4)(c), a rejection of an offer to compromise, in whole or in part, is final and is not subject to further challenge or appeal under this act.</div>

Except as provided in subsection (6), the officer or agent serving the warrant shall proceed upon the warrant in all respects and in the same manner as prescribed by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments by a court of record. This state, through the state treasurer or an authorized representative of the state treasurer, may bid for and purchase any property sold pursuant to this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A person who refuses or fails to surrender any property or rights to property subject to levy, upon demand by the state treasurer or an authorized representative of the state treasurer, is personally liable to this state in a sum equal to the value of the property or rights not surrendered, but not exceeding the amount due for which the levy was made, together with costs and interest on the sum at the rate provided in section 23(2) from the date of the levy. Any amount, other than costs, recovered under this subsection shall be credited against the liability for the collection of which the levy was made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In addition to the personal liability imposed by subsection (2), if a person required to surrender property or rights to property fails or refuses to surrender the property or rights to property without reasonable cause, the person shall be liable for a penalty equal to 50% of the amount recoverable under subsection (2), none of which penalty shall be credited against the liability for the collection of which the levy was made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A person in possession of, or obligated with respect to, property or property rights subject to levy and upon which a levy has been made who, upon demand of the state treasurer or an authorized representative of the state treasurer, surrenders the property or rights to property or discharges the obligation to the state treasurer or an authorized representative of the state treasurer or who pays a liability under subsection (1) shall have his or her obligation to a person delinquent in payment of a tax or other account reduced in an amount equal to the property or rights to property surrendered or amounts paid to the state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) There shall be exempt from levy under this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For an unpaid tax, the type of property and the amount of that property as provided in section 6334 of the internal revenue code of 1986.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For an unpaid account, or amount due the state or any of its departments other than an unpaid tax, disposable earnings to the extent provided in section 303 of title III of the consumer credit protection act, 82 Stat 163, 15 USC 1673.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The effect of a levy on salary or wages shall be continuous from the date the levy is first made until the liability out of which the levy arose is satisfied.</div>

The date of delivery on the receipt shall be the date the levy is made. A person may, upon written notice to the state treasurer, have all notices of levy by mail sent to 1 designated office.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a person liable for a tax administered under this act sells out his or her business or its stock of goods or quits the business, the person shall make a final return within 15 days after the date of selling or quitting the business. The purchaser or succeeding purchasers, if any, who purchase a going or closed business or its stock of goods shall escrow sufficient money to cover the amount of taxes, interest, and penalties as may be due and unpaid until the former owner produces a receipt from the state treasurer or the state treasurer's designated representative showing that the taxes due are paid, or a certificate stating that taxes are not due. Upon the owner's written waiver of confidentiality, the department shall, within 60 days of receipt of the request, release to a purchaser a business's known or estimated tax liability for the purposes of establishing an escrow account for the payment of taxes. The department may estimate tax liability based on prior returns and payments. If the department believes that a return made or payment does not supply sufficient information for an accurate determination, the department may make an estimate based on other available information. If the purchaser or succeeding purchasers of a business or its stock of goods fail to comply with the escrow requirements of this subsection, the purchaser is personally liable for the payment of the taxes, interest, and penalties accrued and unpaid by the business of the former owner. If the purchaser or succeeding purchasers of a business or its stock of goods comply with the escrow requirements of this subsection, the purchaser shall not be held liable for more than the known or estimated tax liability disclosed by the department and held in escrow. However, the purchaser shall not be held liable if the department has failed to provide the information requested within 60 days. For a purchaser or succeeding purchaser that has not complied with the escrow requirements of this section, the purchaser's or succeeding purchaser's personal liability is limited to the fair market value of the business less the amount of any proceeds that are applied to balances due on secured interests that are superior to the lien provided for in section 29(1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A deficiency, interest, or penalty shall not be assessed after the expiration of 4 years after the date set for the filing of the required return or after the date the return was filed, whichever is later. The taxpayer shall not claim a refund of any amount paid to the department after the expiration of 4 years after the date set for the filing of the original return. A person who has failed to file a return is liable for all taxes due for the entire period for which the person would be subject to the taxes. If a person subject to tax fraudulently conceals any liability for the tax or a part of the tax, or fails to notify the department of any alteration in or modification of federal tax liability, the department, within 2 years after discovery of the fraud or the failure to notify, shall assess the tax with penalties and interest as provided by this act, computed from the date on which the tax liability originally accrued. The tax, penalties, and interest are due and payable after notice and hearing as provided by this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The statute of limitations shall be extended for the following if the period exceeds that described in subsection (2):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The period pending a final determination of tax through audit, conference, hearing, and litigation of liability for federal income tax and for 1 year after that period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The period for which the taxpayer and the state treasurer have consented to in writing that the period be extended.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The period described in section 21(6) and (7) or pending the completion of an appeal of a final assessment. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A period of 90 days after a decision and order from an informal conference, or a court order that finally resolves an appeal of a decision of the department in a case in which a final assessment was not issued prior to appeal. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The statute of limitations is extended only as to those items that were the subject of the audit, conference, hearing, or litigation for federal income tax or a tax administered by the department. As used in this subsection, "items that were the subject of the audit" means items that share a common characteristic that were examined by an auditor even if there was no adjustment to the tax as a result of the examination. Items that share a common characteristic include items that are reported on the same line on a tax return or items that are grouped by ledger, account, or record or by class or type of asset, liability, income, or expense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a business liable for taxes administered under this act fails, for any reason after assessment, to file the required returns or to pay the tax due, any of its officers, members, managers of a manager-managed limited liability company, or partners who the department determines, based on either an audit or an investigation, is a responsible person is personally liable for the failure for the taxes described in subsection (14). The dissolution of a business does not discharge a responsible person's liability for a prior failure of the business to file a return or pay the tax due. The sum due for a liability may be assessed and collected under the related sections of this act. The department shall provide a responsible person assessed under this section with notice of any amount collected by the department from any other responsible person determined to be liable under this subsection or purchaser determined to be liable under subsection (1) that is attributable to the assessment. The department shall not assess a responsible person under this section more than 4 years after the date of the assessment issued to the business. A responsible person may challenge the validity of an assessment to the same extent that the business could have challenged that assessment under sections 21 and 22 when originally issued. The department has the burden to first produce prima facie evidence as described in subsection (15) or establish a prima facie case that the person is the responsible person under this subsection through establishment of all elements of a responsible person as defined in subsection (15). In a separate proceeding before the circuit court, a responsible person found to be liable for the assessment under this section may recover from other responsible persons an amount equal to the assessment or portion of the assessment based on that person's proportionate liability for the assessment as determined in that proceeding. Before assessing a responsible person as liable under this subsection for the tax assessed to the business, the department shall first assess a purchaser or succeeding purchaser of the business personally liable under subsection (1) if the department has information that clearly identifies a purchaser or succeeding purchaser under subsection (1) and establishes that the assessment of the purchaser or succeeding purchaser would permit the department to collect the entire amount of the tax assessment of the business. The department may assess a responsible person under this subsection notwithstanding the liability of a purchaser or succeeding purchaser under subsection (1) if the purchaser or succeeding purchaser fails to pay the assessment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, upon request of a responsible person who was issued an intent to assess by the department under section 21 for liability under subsection (5), the department shall disclose any documents considered in the department's audit or investigation in determining that the person is a responsible person and is personally liable for the assessment and any other documents that the tribunal or court determines are necessary for a fair adjudication of a person's liability under subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2), a claim for refund based upon the validity of a tax law based on the laws or constitution of the United States or the state constitution of 1963 shall not be paid unless the claim is filed within 90 days after the date set for filing a return.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Subsection (7) does not apply to a claim for the refund of a tax paid for the 1984 tax year or a tax year after the 1984 tax year on income received as retirement or pension benefits from a public retirement system of the United States government if the claimant waives any claim for the refund of such a tax paid for a tax year before 1984. Claims for refunds to which this subsection applies shall be paid in accordance with the following schedule:

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The department shall not assess the taxpayer an additional tax or reduce an overpayment because the taxpayer included an entity disregarded for federal income tax purposes on its tax return filed under former 1975 PA 228.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The department shall not require the entity disregarded for federal income tax purposes on the taxpayer's tax return filed under former 1975 PA 228 to file a separate tax return.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Notwithstanding any other provision in this act, if a taxpayer filed a tax return under former 1975 PA 228 that included in the tax return an entity disregarded for federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code, then the taxpayer shall not claim a refund based on the entity disregarded for federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code filing a separate return as a distinct taxpayer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Notwithstanding any other provision in this act, the department shall not assess a tax or reduce an overpayment, and shall approve a claim for a refund of any tax paid, under former 1975 PA 228 and subject to the statute of limitations for an individual, estate, or person organized for estate or gift planning purposes for amounts received, income, or gain other than those from transactions, activities, and sources in the regular course of the person's trade or business. For purposes of this subsection, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Receipts, income, and gain that are from transactions, activities, and sources in the regular course of the person's business include, but are not limited to, amounts derived from the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Tangible and intangible property if the acquisition, rental, lease, management, or disposition of the property constitutes integral parts of the person's regular trade or business operations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Transactions in the course of the person's trade or business from stock and securities of any foreign or domestic corporation and dividend and interest income.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Isolated sales, leases, assignments, licenses, divisions, or other infrequently occurring dispositions, transfers, or transactions involving tangible, intangible, or real property if the property is or was used in the person's trade or business operation.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) The lease or rental of real property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Receipts, income, and gain that are not from transactions, activities, and sources in the regular course of the person's trade or business include, but are not limited to, amounts derived from the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The disposition of tangible, intangible, or real property held for personal use and enjoyment, such as a personal residence or personal assets.</div>

A signature, including electronic signature, on a return or negotiable instrument submitted in payment of taxes after the time period of default alone is not prima facie evidence that the person is a responsible person for the time period of default but may be considered along with other evidence to make a prima facie case that the person is a responsible person. With respect to a return or negotiable instrument submitted in payment of taxes before the time period of default, the signature, including electronic signature, on that document along with evidence, other than that document, sufficient to demonstrate that the signatory was an officer, member, manager of a manager-managed limited liability company, or partner during the time period of default is prima facie evidence that the person is a responsible person. </div>

(1) This amendatory act shall not apply to qualified purchase agreements, or verified purchase agreements if in relation to a refund under subsection (4), for a motor vehicle, trailer coach, or titled watercraft entered into on or before March 14, 1984 if the transfer of ownership occurs on or before February 1, 1985 and if a motor vehicle or trailer coach or titled watercraft is used as part payment of the purchase price.“(2) A taxpayer may submit a claim for refund to the department if all of the following occur: “(a) A qualified purchase agreement is entered into on or before March 14, 1984.“(b) The transfer of ownership occurs after March 14, 1984 and on or before 10 days after the effective date of this amendatory act that added this enacting section. “(c) The tax imposed upon the sale at retail was in an amount greater than the tax required if pursuant to this enacting section, this amendatory act had not been applied in determining the gross proceeds upon which the tax was computed.“(d) The taxpayer who paid the excess tax provides satisfactory proof that the taxpayer has reimbursed the purchaser of the motor vehicle, trailer coach, or titled watercraft for the excess paid by the purchaser if applicable.“(3) Upon verification of a claim made pursuant to subsection (2), the department shall refund the exempt tax paid to the claimant.“(4) The department may establish procedures to refund any excess tax paid by the purchaser, directly to the purchaser, when the taxpayer has failed to claim a refund for an overpayment made by the purchaser.“(5) For the purposes of this section, “qualified purchase agreement” means a purchase agreement filed with the department on or before 10 days after the effective date of this amendatory act that added this enacting section.”Enacting section 2 of Act 116 of 1999 provides:“Enacting section 2. This amendatory act clarifies that, with the exception of telecommunications equipment taxed under section 3a of the use tax act, 1937 PA 94, MCL 205.93a, a taxpayer may exclude a sale of tangible personal property from gross proceeds only to the extent that the property is used for exempt purposes. For telecommunications equipment exempt under section 4v of the general sales tax act, 1933 PA 167, MCL 205.54v, this amendatory act clarifies that for periods before April 1, 1999, the tax shall not be apportioned and for periods beginning April 1, 1999, the tax shall be apportioned. This amendatory act clarifies that existing law as originally intended provides a prorated exemption. This amendatory act takes effect for all periods beginning March 31, 1995 and all tax years that are open under the statute of limitations provided in section 27a of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.27a.”Enacting section 1 of Act 8 of 2016 provides:"Enacting section 1.  This amendatory act is retroactive and is effective December 15, 2013."Senate Bill No. 94 was vetoed by the Governor on July 25, 2017.

If the department considers it necessary in order to secure the collection of the tax or if an applicant taxpayer has at any time failed, refused, or neglected to pay any tax or interest or penalty upon a tax or has attempted to evade the payment of any tax or interest or penalty upon a tax by means of petition in bankruptcy, or if the applicant taxpayer is a corporation and the department has reason to believe that the management or control of the corporation is under persons who have failed to pay any tax or interest or penalty upon a tax under this act, the department shall require a surety bond payable to the state of Michigan, upon which the applicant or taxpayer shall be the obligor, in the sum of not less than $1,000.00 nor more than $25,000.00. The surety bond shall be conditioned that the applicant or taxpayer shall comply with this act and shall promptly file true reports and pay the taxes, interest, and penalties provided for or required by this act. The bonds shall be approved as to the amount and surety by the department. The applicant or taxpayer may in lieu of the surety bond deposit a sum of money with the department in an amount the department determines to guarantee the payment of the tax, interest, and penalty and compliance with this act. However, the amount determined by the department shall not exceed the estimated tax payable during a 1-year period. The applicant or taxpayer shall be licensed to engage in and conduct the business. The department may require the applicant or taxpayer to furnish any additional bond that it considers necessary within the limits in this section, after giving a 30-day notice in writing. The license shall be renewed annually if the taxpayer pays the tax accrued to this state under this act. A person shall not engage or continue in a business taxable under this act without securing a license. A person, firm, or corporation engaged solely in industrial processing or agricultural producing under this act and who makes no sales at retail within the meaning of this act is not required to have a license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The state treasurer or his or her designee, after notice and hearing, may suspend the license of a person who violates or fails to comply with this act or a rule promulgated by the department under this act.

The state treasurer or his or her designee may deny an application or renewal and may suspend a license issued under this section if a person fails to comply with this subsection or if a person fraudulently indicates that that person is not subject to the tobacco products tax act, 1993 PA 327, MCL 205.421 to 205.436. The state treasurer or his or her designee may restore a license suspended under this subsection if all delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees due under this act or the tobacco products tax act, 1993 PA 327, MCL 205.421 to 205.436, are paid in full.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The state treasurer or his or her designee may prohibit the sale of any products subject to the tax levied under this act at any location where a person knowingly violated section 8(3) to (7) and (11) of the tobacco products tax act, 1993 PA 327, MCL 205.428.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Notwithstanding section 28(1)(f) of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.28, if a person is prohibited from the sale of products subject to the tax levied under this act under this section, the department shall identify the name, address, and location where the person knowingly violated the tobacco products tax act, 1993 PA 327, MCL 205.421 to 205.436, on the department website.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A person that knowingly violated section 8(3) to (7) and (11) of the tobacco products tax act, 1993 PA 327, MCL 205.428, which violation resulted in a seizure of tobacco products under section 9 of the tobacco products liability act, 1993 PA 327, MCL 205.429, is subject to the following penalties:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As used in this section: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related to a sale at retail taxable under this act for which gross proceeds are not otherwise deductible or excludable and that is eligible to be claimed, or could be eligible to be claimed if the taxpayer kept accounts on an accrual basis, as a deduction pursuant to section 166 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 166. A bad debt shall not include any finance charge, interest, or sales tax on the purchase price, uncollectible amounts on property that remains in the possession of the taxpayer until the full purchase price is paid, expenses incurred in attempting to collect any account receivable or any portion of the debt recovered, any accounts receivable that have been sold to and remain in the possession of a third party for collection, and repossessed property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Except as provided in subdivision (c), "lender" includes any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Any person who holds or has held an account receivable which that person purchased directly from a taxpayer who reported the tax.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Any person who holds or has held an account receivable pursuant to that person's contract directly with the taxpayer who reported the tax.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The issuer of the private label credit card.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Lender" does not include the issuer of a credit card or instrument that can be used to make purchases from a person other than the vendor whose name or logo appears on the card or instrument or that vendor's affiliates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Private label credit card" means any charge card, credit card, or other instrument serving a similar purpose that carries, refers to, or is branded with the name or logo of a vendor and that can only be used for purchases from the vendor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) "Taxpayer" means a person that has remitted sales tax directly to the department on the specific sales at retail transaction for which the bad debt is recognized for federal income tax purposes or, after September 30, 2009, a lender holding the account receivable for which the bad debt is recognized, or would be recognized if the claimant were a corporation, for federal income tax purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In computing the amount of tax levied under this act for any month, a taxpayer may deduct the amount of bad debts from his or her gross proceeds used for the computation of the tax. The amount of gross proceeds deducted must be charged off as uncollectible on the books and records of the taxpayer at the time the debt becomes worthless and deducted on the return for the period during which the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and records and must be eligible to be deducted for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of this section, a claimant who is not required to file a federal income tax return may deduct a bad debt on a return filed for the period in which the bad debt becomes worthless and is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and records and would be eligible for a bad debt deduction for federal income tax purposes if the claimant was required to file a federal income tax return. If a consumer or other person pays all or part of a bad debt with respect to which a taxpayer claimed a deduction under this section, the taxpayer is liable for the amount of taxes deducted in connection with that portion of the debt for which payment is received and shall remit these taxes in his or her next payment to the department. Any payments made on a bad debt shall be applied proportionally first to the taxable price of the property and the tax on the property and second to any interest, service, or other charge.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) After September 30, 2009, if a taxpayer who reported the tax and a lender execute and maintain a written election designating which party may claim the deduction, a claimant is entitled to a deduction or refund of the tax related to a sale at retail that was previously reported and paid if all of the following conditions are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) No deduction or refund was previously claimed or allowed on any portion of the account receivable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The account receivable has been found worthless and written off by the taxpayer that made the sale or the lender on or after September 30, 2009.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Any claim for a bad debt deduction under this section shall be supported by that evidence required by the department. The department shall review any change in the rate of taxation applicable to any taxable sales by a taxpayer claiming a deduction pursuant to this section and shall ensure that the deduction on any bad debt does not result in the taxpayer claiming the deduction recovering any more or less than the taxes imposed on the sale that constitutes the bad debt.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a certified service provider assumed filing responsibility under the streamlined sales and use tax administration act, 2004 PA 174, MCL 205.801 to 205.833, the certified service provider may claim, on behalf of the taxpayer, any bad debt allowable to the taxpayer and shall credit or refund that amount of bad debt allowed or refunded to the taxpayer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the books and records of a taxpayer under the streamlined sales and use tax agreement under the streamlined sales and use tax administration act, 2004 PA 174, MCL 205.801 to 205.833, that claims a bad debt allowance support an allocation of the bad debts among member states of that agreement, the taxpayer may allocate the bad debts.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Through March 31, 2013, at the time of purchase or shipment from a refiner, pipeline terminal operator, or marine terminal operator, a purchaser or receiver of gasoline shall prepay a portion of the tax imposed by this act at the rate provided in this section to the refiner, pipeline terminal operator, or marine terminal operator for the purchase or receipt of gasoline. If the purchase or receipt of gasoline is made outside this state for shipment into and subsequent sale within this state, the purchaser or receiver, other than a refiner, pipeline terminal operator, or marine terminal operator, shall make the prepayment required by this section directly to the department. Prepayments for gasoline shall be made at a cents-per-gallon rate determined by the department and shall be based on 6% of the statewide average retail price of a gallon of self-serve unleaded regular gasoline as determined and certified by the department rounded up to the nearest 1/10 of 1 cent. A person that makes prepayments directly to the department shall make those prepayments according to the schedule in subsection (6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Beginning April 1, 2013 through March 31, 2016, at the time of purchase or shipment from a refiner, pipeline terminal operator, or marine terminal operator, a purchaser or receiver of fuel shall prepay a portion of the tax imposed by this act at the rates provided in this section to the refiner, pipeline terminal operator, or marine terminal operator for the purchase or receipt of fuel. If the purchase or receipt of fuel is made outside this state for shipment into and subsequent sale within this state, the purchaser or receiver, other than a refiner, pipeline terminal operator, or marine terminal operator, shall make the prepayment required by this section directly to the department. Prepayments for gasoline shall be made at a cents-per-gallon rate determined by the department and shall be based on 6% of the statewide average retail price of a gallon of self-serve unleaded regular gasoline as determined and certified by the department rounded up to the nearest 1/10 of 1 cent. Prepayments for diesel fuel shall be made at a cents-per-gallon rate determined by the department and shall be based on 6% of the statewide average retail price of a gallon of undyed No. 2 ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel as determined and certified by the department rounded up to the nearest 1/10 of 1 cent. A person that makes prepayments directly to the department shall make those prepayments according to the schedule in subsection (6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Beginning April 1, 2016, at the time of purchase or shipment in this state from a refiner, pipeline terminal operator, or marine terminal operator, a purchaser or receiver of fuel other than an exporter or supplier for immediate export, as evidenced by the terminal's shipping papers or bill of lading, shall prepay a portion of the tax imposed by this act at the rates provided in this section to the refiner, pipeline terminal operator, or marine terminal operator for the purchase or receipt of fuel. If the purchase or receipt of fuel is made outside this state for shipment into and subsequent sale within this state, the purchaser or receiver, other than a refiner, pipeline terminal operator, or marine terminal operator as part of a bulk transfer, shall make the prepayment required by this section directly to the department. Prepayments for gasoline shall be made at a cents-per-gallon rate determined by the department and shall be based on 6% of the statewide average retail price of a gallon of self-serve unleaded regular gasoline as determined and certified by the department rounded up to the nearest 1/10 of 1 cent.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The rates of prepayment applied pursuant to subsections (2) and (3) shall be determined every month by the department. The department shall publish notice of the rates of prepayment applicable to gasoline and diesel fuel pursuant to subsections (2) and (3) not later than the tenth day of the month immediately preceding the month in which the rate is effective.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A person subject to tax under this act that makes prepayment to another person as required by this section for gasoline may claim an estimated prepayment credit on its regular monthly return filed pursuant to section 6. The credit shall be for prepayments made during the month for which the return is required and shall be based upon the difference between prepayments made in the immediately preceding month and collections of prepaid tax received from sales or transfers during the month for which the return required under section 6 is made. A sale or transfer for which collection of prepaid tax is due the taxpayer is subject to a bad debt deduction under section 4i, whether or not the sale or transfer is a sale at retail. The credit shall not be reduced because of actual shrinkage. A taxpayer that does not, in the ordinary course of business, sell gasoline in each month of the year may, with the approval of the department, base the initial prepayment deduction in each tax year on prepayments made in a month other than the immediately preceding month. The difference in actual prepayments shall be reconciled on the annual return in accordance with procedures prescribed by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Notwithstanding the other provisions for the payment and remitting of tax due under this act, a refiner, pipeline terminal operator, or marine terminal operator shall account for and remit to the department the prepayments received pursuant to this section in accordance with the following schedule:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The refiner, pipeline terminal operator, or marine terminal operator shall not receive a deduction under section 4 for receiving and remitting prepayments from a purchaser or receiver pursuant to this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The purchaser or receiver of fuel that makes prepayments is not subject to further liability for the amount of the prepayment if the refiner, pipeline terminal operator, or marine terminal operator fails to remit the prepayment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A person subject to tax under this act that makes prepayment to another person as required by this section for diesel fuel may claim an estimated prepayment credit on its regular monthly return filed pursuant to section 6. The credit shall be for prepayments made during the month for which the return is required and shall be based upon the difference between the prepayments made in the immediately preceding month and collections of prepaid tax received from sales or transfers during the month for which the return required under section 6 is made. A sale or transfer for which collection of prepaid tax is due the taxpayer is subject to a bad debt deduction under section 4i, whether or not the sale or transfer is a sale at retail. The credit shall not be reduced because of actual shrinkage. A taxpayer that does not, in the ordinary course of business, sell diesel fuel in each month of the year may, with the approval of the department, base the initial prepayment deduction in each tax year on prepayments made in a month other than the immediately preceding month. Estimated prepayment credits claimed with the return due in April 2013 shall be based on the taxpayer's retail sales of diesel fuel in March 2013. The difference in actual prepayments shall be reconciled on the annual return in accordance with procedures prescribed by the department. Repayment of the credit claimed on the return due in April 2013 shall be made by the earlier of the date that the taxpayer stops selling diesel fuel or October 15, 2013.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A person liable for any tax imposed under this act shall keep in a paper, electronic, or digital format an accurate and complete beginning and annual inventory and purchase records of additions to inventory, complete daily sales records, receipts, invoices, bills of lading, and all pertinent documents in a form the department requires. Except as otherwise provided for a person described under subsection (6), if an exemption from the tax under this act is claimed by a person because the sale is for resale at retail, a record must be kept of the sales tax license number if the person has a sales tax license. These records must be retained for a period of 4 years after the tax imposed under this act to which the records apply is due or as otherwise provided by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the department considers it necessary, the department may require a person, by notice served upon that person, to make a return, render under oath certain statements, or keep certain records the department considers sufficient to show whether or not that person is liable for the tax under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A person knowingly making a sale of tangible personal property for the purpose of resale at retail to another person not licensed under this act is liable for the tax under this act unless the transaction is exempt under the provisions of section 4k.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a taxpayer fails to file a return or to maintain or preserve sufficient records as prescribed in this section, or the department has reason to believe that any records maintained or returns filed are inaccurate or incomplete and that additional taxes are due, the department may assess the amount of the tax due from the taxpayer based on an indirect audit procedure or any other information that is available or that may become available to the department. That assessment is considered prima facie correct for the purpose of this act and the burden of proof of refuting the assessment is upon the taxpayer. An indirect audit of a taxpayer under this subsection must be conducted in accordance with 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and the standards published by the department under section 21 of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.21, and must include all of the following elements:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A review of the taxpayer's books and records. The department may use an indirect method to test the accuracy of the taxpayer's books and records.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Both the credibility of the evidence and the reasonableness of the conclusion must be evaluated before any determination of tax liability is made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The department may use any method to reconstruct income, deductions, or expenses that is reasonable under the circumstances. The department may use third-party records in the reconstruction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The department shall investigate all reasonable evidence presented by the taxpayer refuting the computation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a taxpayer has filed all the required returns and has maintained and preserved sufficient records as required under this section, the department shall not base a tax deficiency determination or assessment on any indirect audit procedure unless the department has a documented reason to believe that any records maintained or returns filed are inaccurate or incomplete and that additional taxes are due. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the information required under section 12(1) is maintained, an exemption certificate or any other documentation or information is not required for an exemption claim obtained by any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A person licensed by the Michigan liquor control commission as a wholesaler for purposes of sales of alcoholic liquor to another person licensed by the Michigan liquor control commission. As used in this subsection, "alcoholic liquor", "authorized distribution agent", and "wholesaler" mean those terms as defined in the Michigan liquor control code of 1998, 1998 PA 58, MCL 436.1101 to 436.2303.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The Michigan liquor control commission or a person certified by the commission as an authorized distribution agent for purposes of the sale and distribution of alcoholic liquor to a person licensed by the Michigan liquor control commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For purposes of this act, a blanket exemption claim covers all exempt transfers between the taxpayer and the buyer for a period of 4 years or for a period of less than 4 years as stated on the blanket exemption claim if that period is agreed to by the buyer and taxpayer. Renewal of a blanket exemption claim or an update of exemption claim information or data elements is not required if there is a recurring business relationship between the seller and the purchaser. For purposes of this subsection, a recurring business relationship exists when a period of not more than 12 months elapses between sales transactions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Indirect audit procedure" is an audit method that involves the determination of tax liabilities through an analysis of a taxpayer's business activities using information from a range of sources beyond the taxpayer's declaration and formal books and records.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>205.93b Tax for use or consumption; mobile wireless services; customer's place of primary use; record; reliance upon exempt status for mobile wireless services; repeal of section; condition; air-ground radiotelephone service; bundled transaction; definitions.</B><P>Sec. 3b.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The use or consumption of mobile wireless services is subject to the tax levied under this act in the same manner as tangible personal property regardless of where the mobile wireless services originate, terminate, or pass through, subject to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Mobile wireless services provided to a customer, the charges for which are billed by or for the customer's home service provider, are considered to be provided by the customer's home service provider if the customer's place of primary use for the mobile wireless services is in this state. If the customer's place of primary use for mobile wireless services is outside of this state, the mobile wireless services are not subject to the tax levied under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A home service provider is responsible for obtaining and maintaining a record of the customer's place of primary use. Subject to subsection (2), in obtaining and maintaining a record of the customer's place of primary use, a home service provider may do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Rely in good faith on information provided by a customer as to the customer's place of primary use.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Treat the address used for a customer under a service contract or agreement in effect on August 1, 2002 as that customer's place of primary use for the remaining term of the service contract or agreement, excluding any extension or renewal of the service contract or agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Notwithstanding section 9 and subject to subsection (5), if the department chooses to create or provide a database that complies with the provisions of 4 USC 119, a home service provider shall use that database to determine the assignment of the customer's place of primary use to this state. If a database is not provided by the department, a home service provider may use an enhanced zip code to determine the assignment of the customer's place of primary use to this state. A home service provider that uses a database provided by the department is not liable for any tax that otherwise would be due solely as a result of an error or omission in that database. A home service provider that uses an enhanced zip code is not liable for any tax that otherwise would be due solely as a result of an assignment of a street address to another state if the home provider exercised due diligence to ensure that the appropriate street addresses are assigned to this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If a customer believes that the amount of the tax levied under this act or that the home service provider's record of the customer's place of primary use is incorrect, the customer shall notify the home service provider in writing and provide all of the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The street address of the customer's place of primary use.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The account name and number for which the customer requests the correction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) A description of the error asserted by the customer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Any other information that the home service provider reasonably requires to process the request.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Not later than 60 days after the home service provider receives a request under subdivision (d) or subsection (5)(b), the home service provider shall review its record of the customer's place of primary use and the customer's enhanced zip code to determine the correct amount of the tax levied under this act. If the home service provider determines that the tax levied under this act or its record of the customer's place of primary use is incorrect, the home service provider shall correct the error and refund or credit any tax erroneously collected from the customer. A refund under this subdivision shall not exceed a period of 4 years. If the home service provider determines that the tax levied under this act and the customer's place of primary use are correct, the home service provider shall provide a written explanation of that determination to the customer. The procedures prescribed in this subdivision and in subdivision (d) are the first course of remedy available to a customer requesting a correction of the provider's record of place of primary use or a refund of taxes erroneously collected by the home service provider.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the department makes a final determination that the home service provider's record of a customer's place of primary use is incorrect, the home service provider shall change its records to reflect that final determination. The corrected record of a customer's place of primary use shall be used to calculate the tax levied under this act prospectively, from the date of the department's final determination. The department shall not make a final determination under this subsection before the department has notified the customer that the department has found that the home service provider's record of the customer's place of primary use is incorrect and the customer has been afforded an opportunity to appeal that finding. An appeal to the department shall be conducted according to the provision of section 22 of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.22.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Notwithstanding section 8 and subject to section 5, if the department makes a final determination under subsection (2) that a customer's place of primary use is incorrect, a home service provider is not liable for any taxes that would have been levied under this act if the customer's place of primary use had been correct.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If charges for mobile wireless services and other billed services not subject to the tax levied under this act are aggregated with and not separately stated from charges for mobile wireless services that are subject to the tax levied under this act, the nontaxable mobile wireless services and other billed services are subject to the tax levied under this act unless the home service provider can reasonably identify billings for services not subject to the tax levied under this act from its books and records kept in the regular course of business.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If charges for mobile wireless services and other billed services not subject to the tax levied under this act are aggregated with and not separately stated from charges for mobile wireless services that are subject to the tax levied under this act, a customer may not rely upon the exempt status for those mobile wireless services and other billed services unless 1 or more of the following conditions are satisfied:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The customer's home service provider separately states the charges for mobile wireless services that are exempt and other exempt billed services from taxable mobile wireless services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The home service provider elects, after receiving a written request from the customer in the form required by the home service provider, to identify the exempt mobile wireless services and other exempt billed services by reference to the home service provider's books and records kept in the regular course of business.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) This section is repealed as of the date of entry of a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that substantially limits or impairs the essential elements of sections 116 to 126 of title 4 of the United States Code, 4 USC 116 to 126, and that final judgment is no longer subject to appeal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For an air-ground radiotelephone service, the tax under this act is imposed at the location of the origination of the air-ground radiotelephone service in this state as identified by the home service provider or information received by the home service provider from its servicing carrier.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) All of the following apply in the case of a bundled transaction that includes telecommunications service, ancillary service, internet access, or audio or video programming:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the purchase price is attributable to products that are taxable and products that are nontaxable, the portion of the purchase price attributable to the nontaxable products may be subject to tax unless the provider can identify by reasonable and verifiable standards that portion from its books and records kept in the regular course of business for other purposes, including, but not limited to, nontax purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the purchase price is attributable to products that are subject to tax at different tax rates, the total purchase price may be treated as attributable to the products subject to tax at the highest tax rate unless the provider can identify by reasonable and verifiable standards the portion of the purchase price attributable to the products subject to tax at the lower rate from its books and records kept in the regular course of business for other purposes, including, but not limited to, nontax purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The provisions of this subsection shall apply unless otherwise provided by federal law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Air-ground radiotelephone service" means that term as defined in 47 CFR part 22.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Commercial mobile radio service" means that term as defined in 47 CFR 20.3.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) In computing the amount of tax levied under this act for any month, a seller may deduct the amount of bad debts from his or her gross sales, rentals, or services used for the computation of the tax. The amount of gross sales, rentals, or services deducted must be charged off as uncollectible on the books and records of the seller at the time the debt becomes worthless and deducted on the return for the period during which the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and records and must be eligible to be deducted for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of this section, a claimant who is not required to file a federal income tax return may deduct a bad debt on a return filed for the period in which the bad debt becomes worthless and is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and records and would be eligible for a bad debt deduction for federal income tax purposes if the claimant was required to file a federal income tax return. If a consumer or other person pays all or part of a bad debt with respect to which a seller claimed a deduction under this section, the seller is liable for the amount of taxes deducted in connection with that portion of the debt for which payment is received and shall remit these taxes in his or her next payment to the department. Any payments made on a bad debt shall be applied proportionally first to the taxable price of the property and the tax on the property and second to any interest, service, or other charge.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Any claim for a bad debt deduction under this section shall be supported by that evidence required by the department. The department shall review any change in the rate of taxation applicable to any taxable sales, rentals, or services by a seller claiming a deduction pursuant to this section and shall ensure that the deduction on any bad debt does not result in the seller claiming the deduction recovering any more or less than the taxes imposed on the sale, rental, or service that constitutes the bad debt.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) After September 30, 2009, if a taxpayer who reported the tax and a lender execute and maintain a written election designating which party may claim the deduction, a claimant is entitled to a deduction or refund of the tax related to a sale at retail that was previously reported and paid if all of the following conditions are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) No deduction or refund was previously claimed or allowed on any portion of the account receivable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The account receivable has been found worthless and written off by the taxpayer that made the sale or the lender on or after September 30, 2009.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a certified service provider assumed filing responsibility under the streamlined sales and use tax administration act, 2004 PA 174, MCL 205.801 to 205.833, the certified service provider may claim, on behalf of the seller, any bad debt allowable to the seller and shall credit or refund that amount of bad debt allowed or refunded to the seller.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the books and records of a seller under the streamlined sales and use tax agreement under the streamlined sales and use tax administration act, 2004 PA 174, MCL 205.801 to 205.833, that claims a bad debt allowance support an allocation of the bad debts among member states of that agreement, the seller may allocate the bad debts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) As used in this section: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Bad debt" means any portion of a debt resulting from a seller's collection of the use tax under this act on the purchase of tangible personal property or services that is not otherwise deductible or excludable and that is eligible to be claimed, or could be eligible to be claimed if the seller kept accounts on an accrual basis, as a deduction pursuant to section 166 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 166. A bad debt does not include any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Interest, finance charge, or use tax on the purchase price.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Uncollectible amounts on property that remains in the possession of the seller until the full purchase price is paid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Expenses incurred in attempting to collect any account receivable or any portion of the debt recovered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Any accounts receivable that have been sold to and remain in the possession of a third party for collection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Repossessed property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Except as provided in subdivision (c), "lender" includes any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Any person who holds or has held an account receivable which that person purchased directly from a taxpayer who reported the tax.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Any person who holds or has held an account receivable pursuant to that person's contract directly with the taxpayer who reported the tax. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The issuer of the private label credit card.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Lender" does not include the issuer of a credit card or instrument that can be used to make purchases from a person other than the vendor whose name or logo appears on the card or instrument or that vendor's affiliates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Private label credit card" means any charge card, credit card, or other instrument serving a similar purpose that carries, refers to, or is branded with the name or logo of a vendor and that can only be used for purchases from the vendor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) "Seller" means a person who has remitted use tax directly to the department on the specific sales, rental, or service transaction for which the bad debt is recognized for federal income tax purposes or, after September 30, 2009, a lender holding the account receivable for which the bad debt is recognized, or would be recognized if the claimant were a corporation, for federal income tax purposes.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A person in the business of selling tangible personal property and liable for any tax under this act shall keep in a paper, electronic, or digital format an accurate and complete beginning and annual inventory and purchase records of additions to inventory, complete daily sales records, receipts, invoices, bills of lading, and all pertinent documents in a form the department requires. Except as otherwise provided for a person described under subsection (6), if an exemption from use tax is claimed by a person because the sale is for resale at retail, a record must be kept of the sales tax license number if the person has a sales tax license. These records must be retained for a period of 4 years after the tax imposed under this act to which the records apply is due or as otherwise provided by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the department considers it necessary, the department may require a person, by notice served upon that person, to make a return, render under oath certain statements, or keep certain records the department considers sufficient to show whether or not that person is liable for the tax under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A person knowingly making a sale of tangible personal property for the purpose of resale at retail to another person not licensed under this act is liable for the tax imposed under this act unless the transaction is exempt under the provisions of section 4i.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a taxpayer fails to file a return or to maintain or preserve sufficient records as prescribed in this section, or the department has reason to believe that any records maintained or returns filed are inaccurate or incomplete and that additional taxes are due, the department may assess the amount of the tax due from the taxpayer based on an indirect audit procedure or any other information that is available or that may become available to the department. That assessment is considered prima facie correct for the purpose of this act and the burden of proof of refuting the assessment is upon the taxpayer. An indirect audit of a taxpayer under this subsection must be conducted in accordance with 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and the standards published by the department under section 21 of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.21, and must include all of the following elements:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A review of the taxpayer's books and records. The department may use an indirect method to test the accuracy of the taxpayer's books and records.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Both the credibility of the evidence and the reasonableness of the conclusion must be evaluated before any determination of tax liability is made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The department may use any method to reconstruct income, deductions, or expenses that is reasonable under the circumstances. The department may use third-party records in the reconstruction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The department shall investigate all reasonable evidence presented by the taxpayer refuting the computation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a taxpayer has filed all the required returns and has maintained and preserved sufficient records as required under this section, the department shall not base a tax deficiency determination or assessment on any indirect audit procedure unless the department has a documented reason to believe that any records maintained or returns filed are inaccurate or incomplete and that additional taxes are due.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the information required under section 14b(1) is maintained, an exemption certificate or any other documentation or information is not required for an exemption claim obtained by any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A person licensed by the Michigan liquor control commission as a wholesaler for purposes of sales of alcoholic liquor to another person licensed by the Michigan liquor control commission. As used in this subsection, "alcoholic liquor", "authorized distribution agent", and "wholesaler" mean those terms as defined in the Michigan liquor control code of 1998, 1998 PA 58, MCL 436.1101 to 436.2303.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The Michigan liquor control commission or a person certified by the commission as an authorized distribution agent for purposes of the sale and distribution of alcoholic liquor to a person licensed by the Michigan liquor control commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For purposes of this act, exemption certificate includes a blanket exemption certificate on a form prescribed by the department that covers all exempt transfers between the taxpayer and the buyer for a period of 4 years or for a period of less than 4 years as stated on the blanket exemption certificate if that period is agreed to by the buyer and taxpayer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Indirect audit procedure" is an audit method that involves the determination of tax liabilities through an analysis of a taxpayer's business activities using information from a range of sources beyond the taxpayer's declaration and formal books and records.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Sufficient records" means records that meet the department's need to determine the tax due under this act.</div>

For purposes of this section, a recurring business relationship exists when a period of not more than 12 months elapses between sales transactions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A purchaser that fails to claim an exemption at the time of purchase by notifying the seller of the exemption and providing a complete and proper claim of exemption may submit a claim for a refund to the department for the tax related to that purchase if all of the following conditions are met:</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A tax is imposed upon the transfer of any property, real or personal, of the value of $100.00 or over, or of any interest therein or income therefrom, in trust or otherwise, to persons or corporations, not exempt by law in this state from taxation on real or personal property or not heretofore or hereafter existing within this state as incorporated foundations or not heretofore existing within this state as established nonprofit unincorporated foundations operated exclusively for benevolent, charitable, or educational purposes, in the following cases:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   When the transfer is by will or by the intestate laws of this state from any person dying seized or possessed of the property while a resident of this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   When the transfer is by will or intestate law of property within the state, and the decedent was a nonresident of the state at the time of his or her death.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   When the transfer is of property made by a resident or by nonresident, when the nonresident's property is within this state, by deed, grant, bargain, sale, or gift made in contemplation of the death of the grantor, vendor, or donor or intended to take effect, in possession or enjoyment at or after such death. Any transfer of a material part of this property in the nature of a final disposition or distribution made by the decedent within 2 years prior to his or her death, except in case of a bona fide sale for a fair consideration in money or money's worth, shall, unless shown to the contrary, be deemed to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this section. The tax shall also be imposed when any such grantee, vendee, or donee becomes beneficially entitled in possession or expectancy to any property or the income of the property by any such transfer, whether made before or after the passage of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Whenever any person or persons, corporation or association, whether voluntary or organized pursuant to law, shall exercise a power of appointment derived from any disposition of property made either before or after the passage of this act, the appointment when made shall be deemed a transfer taxable under this act in the same manner as though the property to which the appointment relates belonged absolutely to the donee of the power and had been bequeathed or devised to the donee by will; and whenever any person or persons, corporation or association, whether voluntary or organized pursuant to law, possessing such a power of appointment so derived shall omit or fail to exercise the power of appointment within the time provided, in whole or in part, a transfer taxable under this act shall be deemed to take place to the extent of the omission or failure, in the same manner as though the person or persons, corporation or association thereby becoming entitled to the possession or enjoyment of the property to which the power related had succeeded thereto by a will of the donee of the power failing to exercise the power, taking effect at the time of the omission or failure. This subdivision is construed so that the exercise of a power of appointment or the omission or failure to exercise a power of appointment does not constitute a taxable transfer under this act if the transfer, by the donor of the power, of the property to which the appointment relates is not described within subdivision (a), (b), or (c).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Notwithstanding subsection (1), a tax shall not be imposed in respect of personal property, except tangible personal property having an actual situs in this state, if 1 of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The transferor at the time of the transfer was a resident of a state or territory of the United States, or of any foreign country, which at the time of the transfer did not impose a transfer tax or death tax of any character in respect of personal property of residents of this state, except tangible personal property having an actual situs in that state or territory or foreign country.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the laws of the state, territory, or country of residence of the transferor at the time of the transfer contained a reciprocal exemption provision under which nonresidents were exempted from transfer taxes or death taxes of every character in respect of personal property, except tangible personal property having an actual situs therein, provided the state, territory, or country of residence of such nonresidents allowed a similar exemption to residents of the state, territory, or country of residence of the transferor. For the purposes of this section the District of Columbia and possessions of the United States shall be considered territories of the United States. As used in this subsection, "foreign country" and "country" mean both any foreign country and any political subdivision of that country, and either of them of which the transferor was domiciled at the time of his or her death. For the purposes of this section, "tangible personal property" shall be construed to exclude all property commonly classed as intangible personal property, such as deposits in banks, mortgages, debts, receivables, shares of stock, bonds, notes, credits, evidences of an interest in property, evidences of debt, and like incorporeal personal property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Notwithstanding subsection (1), a tax shall not be imposed in respect of property passing to a trustee or trustees of any trust agreement or trust deed heretofore or hereafter executed by a resident or nonresident decedent by virtue of or under the terms and provisions of any contract or contracts of insurance heretofore or hereafter in force, insuring the life of such decedent, and paid or payable at or after the death of the decedent to the trustee or trustees for the benefit of a beneficiary or beneficiaries having any present or future, vested, contingent, or defeasible interest under such trust deed or trust agreement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If an unincorporated foundation provided tax exempt status by subsection (1) ceases to operate if its funds are diverted from the lawful purposes of its organization, or if it becomes unable to lawfully serve its purposes, the legislature may by law provide for the winding up of its affairs and for the conservation and disposition of its property, in such way as may best promote and perpetuate the purposes for which the unincorporated foundation was originally organized.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Every transfer to any corporation, society, institution, or person or persons, or association of persons for benevolent, charitable, religious, or educational purposes, organized, existing, or operating under the laws of or within a state or territory of the United States, other than this state, or of the District of Columbia, also shall be exempt from taxation under this act, if at the date of the transfer which, excepting as to gifts by living persons, shall be deemed to be the date of decedent's death, the laws of the state or territory or of the District of Columbia, under which such corporation, society, institution, person or persons, or association of persons was organized, existing, or operating did not impose a death tax of any character in respect to property transferred to such a corporation, society, institution, person or persons, or association of persons organized, existing, or operating under the laws of or within this state, or if at the date of the transfer the laws of the state or territory or of the District of Columbia contained a reciprocal provision under which such a transfer to such a corporation, society, institution, person or persons, or association of persons organized, existing, or operating under the laws of or within another state or territory or of the District of Columbia were exempted from death taxes of every character, if the other state or territory or of the District of Columbia allowed a similar exemption to such a corporation, society, institution, person or persons, or association of persons organized, existing, or operating under the laws of another state or territory or of the District of Columbia.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The exemption provided in this subsection shall be effective with respect to transfers from decedents whose death occurred on or after May 1, 1950. Any tax previously paid on transfers made exempt by this subsection shall be refunded.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Notwithstanding subsection (1), but subject to subsection (7), if the decedent dies after December 31, 1982 and if the decedent makes or has made a transfer otherwise subject to tax under this act to the surviving spouse of the decedent or to the surviving spouse of the decedent and another person or persons, and if this transfer qualifies for the marital deduction for purposes of the federal estate tax in the estate of the decedent or if this transfer would have qualified for the federal estate tax marital deduction if the transfer had been included in the gross estate of the decedent for purposes of the federal estate tax, the transfer, using values as finally determined for purposes of this act, shall be exempt from taxation under this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The exemption provided by subsection (6) shall be subject to the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   On the death of the first spouse to die, if the executor properly elects to treat a transfer or specific portion of a transfer as qualified terminable interest property, then on the death of the surviving spouse, the transfer of qualified terminable interest property, using values on the death of the surviving spouse, shall be considered a transfer of the surviving spouse subject to subsection (1). For purposes of determining tax rates and exemptions applicable to such transfer, the relationship of each successor on the death of the surviving spouse shall be to the spouse to which the successor bears the closer relationship, and other transfers from the surviving spouse to such successors shall be taken into account first. If the executor is not required by federal law to file a federal estate tax return, the provisions in this subsection will apply if the executor makes an irrevocable election to have them apply on or before 9 months after the date of decedent's death, and files such election on or before that date with the revenue division of the department of treasury.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If a transfer to the surviving spouse, or to the surviving spouse and other persons, is of an interest in a group of assets not all of which are subject to tax under this act, for purposes of the application of subsection (6), on the death of the first spouse to die, the surviving spouse or the surviving spouse and others persons, shall be considered to have received a pro rata portion of the group of assets in the same proportion that the value of that portion of the group of assets not subject to tax under this act bears to the value of the entire group of assets.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   For purposes of subsections (6) and (7):</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Executor" means that term as defined by section 2203 of the internal revenue code.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Qualified terminable interest property" means a transfer or a specific portion of a transfer which the executor elects to treat as qualified terminable interest property, as that term is defined by section 2056(b)(7) of the internal revenue code, for purposes of the federal estate tax or for purposes of subsection (7), to the extent subsections (6) and (7) apply to the transfer or specific portion of the transfer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The inheritance tax imposed on the estate of the surviving spouse with respect to qualified terminable interest property shall be paid from qualified terminable interest property unless the surviving spouse's will specifically provides otherwise.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 1a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The terms "death tax" and "death taxes", as used in the 5 following subsections, include inheritance, succession, transfer and estate taxes and any taxes levied against the estate of a decedent upon the occasion of his or her death.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Before the expiration of 18 months after the qualification in any probate court in this state of any executor of the will or administrator of the estate of any non-resident decedent, the executor or administrator shall file with the court proof that all death taxes, together with interest or penalties on those taxes, which are due to the state of domicile of the decedent, or to any political subdivision, have been paid or secured, or that no taxes, interest, or penalties are due, as the case may be, unless it appears that letters testamentary or of administration have been issued on the estate of the decedent in the state of his or her domicile, in subsections (3), (4), (5), or (6), called the domiciliary state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The proof required by subsection (2) may be in the form of a certificate issued by the official or body charged with the administration of the death tax laws of the domiciliary state. If that proof has not been filed within the time limited in subsection (2), and if within that time it does not appear that letters testamentary or of administration have been issued in the domiciliary state, the register of probate shall immediately upon the expiration of the time notify by mail the official or body of the domiciliary state charged with the administration of the death tax laws with respect to that estate, and shall state in the notice so far as is known to him or her the name, date of death, and last domicile of the decedent, the name and address of each executor or administrator, a summary of the values of the real estate, tangible personalty, and intangible personalty, wherever situated, belonging to the decedent at the time of his or her death, and the fact that the executor or administrator has not filed the proof required in subsection (2). The register shall attach to the notice a plain copy of the will and codicils of the decedent, if he or she died testate, or, if he or she died intestate, a list of his or her heirs and next of kin, so far as is known to such register. Within 60 days after the mailing of the notice the official or body charged with the administration of the death tax laws of the domiciliary state may file with the probate court in this state a petition for an accounting in the estate, and the official or body of the domiciliary state shall, for the purposes of this section, be a party interested for the purpose of petitioning the probate court for the accounting. If the petition is filed within 60 days, the probate court shall order an accounting. When the accounting is filed and approved, the probate court shall decree either the payment of any tax found to be due to the domiciliary state or subdivision of that state or the remission to a fiduciary, appointed or to be appointed by the probate court or other court charged with the administration of estates of decedents of the domiciliary state, of the balance of the intangible personalty after the payment of creditors and expenses of administration in this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   No final account of an executor or administrator of a non-resident decedent shall be allowed unless 1 of the following applies:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Proof has been filed as required by subsection (2). </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Notice under subsection (3) has been given to the official or body charged with the administration of the death tax laws of the domiciliary state, and either of the following applies:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   That official or body has not petitioned for an accounting under subsection (3) within 60 days after the mailing of the notice.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   An accounting has been had under subsection (3), a decree has been made upon the accounting, and it appears that the executor or administrator has paid the sums and remitted such securities, if any, as he was required to pay or remit by such decree.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   It appears that letters testamentary or of administration have been issued by the domiciliary state and that no notice has been given under subsection (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Subsections (1) to (4), inclusive, shall apply to the estate of a non-resident decedent, only in case the laws of the domiciliary state contain a provision, of any nature or however expressed, whereby this state is given reasonable assurance, as finally determined by the state treasurer, of the collection of its death taxes, interest and penalties from the estates of decedents dying domiciled in this state, when the estates are administered in whole or in part by a probate court, or other court charged with the administration of estates of decedents, in such other state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Subsections (1) to (5) shall be liberally construed in order to ensure that the domiciliary state of any non-resident decedent whose estate is administered in this state shall receive any death taxes, together with interest and penalties thereon, due to it from the estate of the decedent.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Where the persons entitled to a beneficial interest in the property are the grandfather, grandmother, father, mother, husband, wife, child, legally adopted child, stepchild, brother, sister, wife or widow of a son, or the husband or widower of a daughter of the decedent grantor, donor, or vendor, or for the use of a person to whom the decedent grantor, donor, or vendor stood in the mutually acknowledged relation of a parent, if the relationship began at or before the child's seventeenth birthday and continued until the death of the decedent grantor, donor, or vendor, or to or for the use of a lineal descendant of or a lineal descendant of a stepchild of the decedent grantor, donor, or vendor, the transfer of property of the clear market value of $10,000.00 or for a decedent who dies after December 31, 1992 but before January 1, 1994, $15,000.00, for a decedent who dies after December 31, 1993 but before January 1, 1995, $25,000.00, or, for a decedent who dies after December 31, 1994, $50,000.00 is exempt from all taxation under this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Where the transfer is to a husband or wife the transfer of property of the clear market value of $65,000.00 shall be exempt from all taxation under this act. If property is not transferred to a minor child or children, the widow shall be entitled to an additional exemption of $5,000.00 for each child to whom property is not transferred.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the clear market value of the property transferred to each of the persons included in the classes specified in subsection (1) exceeds the exemptions specified, the exemptions shall first be deducted from the value of the property. When the clear market value of the property does not exceed $50,000.00 before deducting the exemptions, the transfer of the property in excess of the exemptions and up to $50,000.00 shall be taxed at the rate of 2% of the clear market value of the property. When the clear market value of the property exceeds $50,000.00 the excess over exemptions of the first $50,000.00 shall be taxed as provided in this subsection and the transfer of that portion of the property in excess of $50,000.00 and up to $250,000.00 shall be taxed at the rate of 4% of the clear market value of the property. The transfer of that portion of the property in excess of $250,000.00 and up to $500,000.00 shall be taxed at the rate of 7% of the clear market value of the property. The transfer of that portion of the property in excess of $500,000.00 and up to $750,000.00 shall be taxed at the rate of 8% of the clear market value of the property. The transfer of that portion of the property in excess of $750,000.00 shall be taxed at the rate of 10% of the clear market value of the property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The exemptions of section 1 and subsections (1), (2), and section 2d shall apply and be granted to each beneficiary's interest in the property, and not to the entire estate of a decedent. A deduction or exemption from the tax shall not be made for an allowance granted by the order of a court for the maintenance and support of the widow or family of a decedent pending the administration of the estate when there is income from the estate accruing after death, which is available to pay the allowance, or for a longer period than 1 year, or for a greater amount than is actually used and expended for the maintenance and support of the widow or family for 1 year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Except as provided in this act, in cases other than those specified in subsection (3), the tax shall be at the rate of 12% upon the clear market value of the property transferred not exceeding $50,000.00, 14% upon all in excess of $50,000.00 and up to $500,000.00, and 17% upon all in excess of $500,000.00.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   For the estate of a decedent who dies after December 31, 1992, a tax is not imposed under this section on the transfer of any property, real or personal, of a family-owned business or the transfer of the ownership of a family-owned business to a qualified heir or heirs.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the total of inheritance taxes levied and imposed by this act upon the inheritance or transfers of property of a resident or nonresident decedent does not equal or exceed the maximum credit for state death taxes allowable to the estate of the decedent against the federal estate tax imposed with respect thereto, there is levied and imposed an additional estate tax that is equal to the differences between the maximum credit allowed and the tax otherwise imposed by this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A proper reduction of the amount of tax levied under subsection (1) shall be made on account of any real and tangible personal property located outside this state that is a part of the gross transfers of a resident decedent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The tax levied under subsection (1) upon the transfers of nonresident decedents shall be that proportion of the total tax as the gross property within this state bears to the gross property of the decedent wherever located.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The purpose of this section is to obtain the maximum benefit of the credit allowed under the provisions of the federal estate tax and it shall be liberally construed to effect this purpose.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The additional tax shall be levied and assessed upon the transfers and against the interests of beneficiaries liable for inheritance taxes, who would be liable to pay the federal estate tax before deducting the credit. The person required to file the federal estate tax return shall file a duplicate of the federal return and all adjustments, corrections, and the final determination of that return with the probate court. Upon the final determination of the federal estate tax and the maximum credit allowable, appropriate adjustment shall be made to any partial or interim inheritance tax determinations or orders.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A tax is imposed upon every generation-skipping transfer in which the original transferor is a resident of this state at the date of the transfer by the original transferor. The tax is equal to the maximum allowable federal credit under the internal revenue code for state generation-skipping transfer taxes paid to the states. This tax shall be reduced by the amount of all generation-skipping taxes paid to states other than this state, which amount shall not exceed an amount equal to the proportional share of that maximum allowable federal credit that the gross value of all transferred real and tangible personal property subject to generation-skipping transfer taxes located in states other than this state bears to the gross value of all transferred property subject to generation-skipping taxes wherever located. A tax is imposed upon every generation-skipping transfer in which the original transferor is not a resident of this state at the date of the transfer by the original transferor but in which the property transferred includes real or tangible personal property located in this state. The tax is an amount equal to the proportional share of the maximum allowable federal credit under the internal revenue code for state generation-skipping transfer taxes paid to the states that the gross value of all transferred real and tangible personal property subject to generation-skipping transfer taxes located in this state bears to the gross value of all transferred property subject to generation-skipping transfer taxes wherever located. The time for the filing of the return and the due date of the taxes under this subsection are the same as the filing of the return date and due date of the federal generation-skipping transfer tax provided for in the internal revenue code.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   "Federal estate tax" means the tax levied and imposed under the provisions of the internal revenue code, in effect on the date of death of the decedent.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2d.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The transfer of qualified farm real property to the qualified heir shall be exempt in the amount of 50% of the clear market value from all taxation under this act if the qualified heir executes a farmland development rights agreement pursuant to part 361 (farmland and open space preservation) of the natural resources and environmental protection act, Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.36101 to 324.36117 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. The qualified heir who is party to an executed farmland development rights agreement may elect to defer the balance of the taxes due under this act on the transfer of qualified farm real property for a period of 10 years without penalty or interest. The executor, administrator, or trustee of the estate and the qualified heir may make the election provided by this subsection by filing an affidavit with the judge of probate, which shall be made in the time and manner and with the content prescribed by the judge of probate. The judge of probate shall consider all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Whether both the executor, administrator, or trustee of the estate and the qualified heir have made the election provided by this subsection by filing an affidavit within the prescribed time and manner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Whether the proposed transfer is to a qualified heir as defined in section 21.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Whether the proposed transfer is of qualified farm real property as defined in section 21.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The judge of probate may request assistance from either the soil conservation district agency or the state land use agency in finding if the real property in question is farmland. If the judge of probate finds all of the factors described in subsection (1), the judge of probate shall issue an order which shall suspend for a period of 6 months the payment of any tax imposed by this act, authorize the transfer of the qualified farm real property to the qualified heir, and require the qualified heir of the qualified farm real property to apply for a farmland development rights agreement pursuant to part 361 of Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994 within 30 days after the date of the order. The judge of probate shall notify the state land use agency in the department of natural resources of this order. If the qualified heir fails to apply for a farmland development rights agreement, the tax imposed by this act shall be immediately due and there shall be added the maximum penalty and interest allowed in section 4 and any costs the judge of probate considers appropriate for this failure. The procedures, provisions and terms of a farmland development rights agreement shall be consistent with part 361 of Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994. If the state land use agency either executes on behalf of the state a farmland development rights agreement or rejects an application for that agreement, it shall notify the judge of probate. Beginning 10 years after the effective date of the farmland development rights agreement, the 50% exemption for qualified farm real property provided by subsection (1) shall be a permanent exemption if the requirements of the farmland development rights agreement are satisfied under part 361 of Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994. If the owner of record of real property subject to a farmland development rights agreement either sells the real property or ceases to use the real property for an agricultural use, the owner of record shall immediately notify the state land use agency and the commissioner of revenue of the sale or the nonagricultural use in form and content as prescribed by each.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If real property subject to a farmland development rights agreement is sold by the owner of record within 5 years after the effective date of the agreement, the following amount shall be immediately due to the state by the seller:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Taxes shall not be due if the successor in title is another qualified heir of the decedent and the successor in title complies with the provisions contained in the farmland development rights agreement. The exempt and deferred tax liability shall be transferred to the successor in title.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The total amount of otherwise exempt and deferred taxes shall be due without penalty or interest if the successor in title is not a qualified heir of the decedent and the successor in title complies with the provisions contained in the farmland development rights agreement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The total amount of otherwise exempt and deferred taxes shall be due with interest at the rate of 3/4 of 1% per month compounded from the time the exemption was received until the taxes are paid if the request by the owner of record for relinquishment of the farmland development rights agreement is approved pursuant to section 36111(2)(b) of part 361 of Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being section 324.36111 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The total amount of otherwise exempt and deferred taxes shall be due without penalty or interest, in a case where the farmland development rights agreement is relinquished by the state pursuant to either section 36110(2) or 36111(2)(a) of part 361 of Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.36110 and 324.36111 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If real property subject to a farmland development rights agreement is sold by the owner of record not less than 6 but not more than 10 years after the effective date of the agreement, a proration of the remaining months multiplied by the following amount shall be immediately due to the state by the seller:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Taxes shall not be due if the successor in title is another qualified heir of the decedent and the successor in title complies with the provisions contained in the farmland development rights agreement. The exempt and deferred tax liability shall be transferred to the successor in title.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The total amount of otherwise exempt and deferred taxes shall be due without penalty or interest if the successor in title is not a qualified heir of the decedent and the successor in title complies with the provisions contained in the farmland development rights agreement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The total amount of otherwise exempt and deferred taxes shall be due with interest at the rate of 3/4 of 1% per month compounded added to this amount from the time this exemption was received until the taxes are paid if the request by the owner of record for relinquishment of the farmland development rights agreement is approved pursuant to section 36111(2)(b) of part 361 of Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The total amount of otherwise exempt and deferred taxes shall be due without penalty or interest if the farmland development rights agreement is relinquished by the state pursuant to either section 36110(2) or 36111(2)(a) of part 361 of Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the owner of record ceases to use real property subject to a farmland development rights agreement for an agricultural use, the total amount of otherwise and deferred taxes shall be due with interest at the rate of 3/4 of 1% per month compounded added to this amount from the time the exemption was received until the taxes are paid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Subsections (1) through (5) apply to a transfer of a decedent who dies before January 1, 1993. Subsection (7) applies to a transfer of a decedent who dies after December 31, 1992.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   For the estate of a decedent who dies after December 31, 1992, the transfer of qualified farm real and personal property or the transfer of the ownership of qualified farm real and personal property to a qualified heir is exempt from taxation under section 2.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The tax and the interest on the tax provided for in this act shall become a lien upon the property transferred until paid, unless payment of the tax has been deferred as permitted by this section or section 2d. If a deferral of payment is granted under this section or section 2d, the lien provided by this section shall attach at the end of the deferral period granted by this section or section 2d.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The person to whom the property is transferred and the administrator, executor, and trustee of every estate transferred, shall be personally liable for the tax until its payments; except that the executor or administrator shall not be personally liable for the tax upon a reversion or remainder consisting of real estate where the election provided for in section 7 or the deferral in this section or section 2d is made. The tax shall be paid to the state. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) When the inheritance tax, administration fee, and penalty and interest, if applicable, for the estate are paid, the revenue commissioner shall provide notice, on a form prescribed by the department, to the judge of probate who shall file and preserve it in that office. It shall be a voucher in settlement of the accounts of the executor, administrator, or trustee of the estate upon which the tax is paid. The preparation and mailing of the receipts shall not prejudice the right of the state to a review of the determination fixing the tax. The receipts issued under this section shall show whether the amount paid is a payment of the tax upon any beneficial interest or upon the entire transfer.  An executor, administrator, or trustee of an estate, in settlement of which a tax is due under this act, shall not be discharged and the estate or trust closed by a decree of the court, unless there is produced a receipt signed by the revenue commissioner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) All taxes imposed by this act shall accrue and be due and payable at the time of transfer, which is the date of death, except that taxes upon the transfer of any estate, property, or interest limited, conditioned, dependent, or determinable upon the happening of a contingency or future event, by reason of which the clear market value cannot be ascertained at the time of the transfer, shall accrue and become due and payable when the persons or corporations beneficially entitled shall come into actual possession or enjoyment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5)   The tax and the interest on the tax provided for in this act may be deferred for reasonable cause shown by the executor, administrator, or trustee of the estate of a decedent who was a professional artist at the date of his or her death for not more than 10 years without penalty or interest. The executor, administrator, or trustee of the estate may make the deferral provided by this subsection by filing an affidavit with the judge of probate, which shall be made in the time and manner and with the content prescribed by the judge of probate. The judge of probate shall determine whether there is reasonable cause shown to grant a deferral, the length of time for the deferral, and the manner of payment of the tax.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6)   A proceeding to enforce a lien against any property under this act shall be instituted by information, in the name of the people of this state, addressed to the circuit court for the county in which the property is situated. It shall be signed by the attorney general and need not be otherwise verified. A person owning the property or an interest in the property as shown by the record in the office of the register of deeds, or by the records of the probate court, at the time of the commencement of the proceedings, shall be made a party to the action, and all other persons having a right or interest in the property, may make themselves parties to the proceeding, on motion to the court, and notice to complainant, and may file their intervening or cross-claims, or answers claiming the benefit of cross-claims, and notices of lis pendens therein. Intervening or cross-claims shall be made on oath.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7)   The information shall show the name of the deceased, the date of death, the place of residence at the time of death, the county in which the estate was probated, the description of the property transferred, whether by will or under the intestate laws, and against which the lien exists, the name of the person or persons to whom it was transferred, the amount of taxes determined by the probate court upon the transfer, the date of the determination and whether the property is owned by the person or persons to whom it was transferred by will or under the intestate laws or by a subsequent purchaser, naming that purchaser. The information shall also show that the taxes determined upon the transfer of the property have not been paid and the amount of interest due upon the date of the filing of the information. In those cases in which the property upon which the lien exists is owned by the person or persons to whom it was transferred by will or under the intestate laws, the petition for relief shall be that the court determine the amount due; that the defendant pay to the county treasurer of the county, in which the estate was probated, for and in behalf of this state, whatever sum shall appear to be due, together with the costs of the proceeding, and that in default of that payment the property upon which the lien exists, may be sold in the manner provided in this act, to satisfy the taxes, interest, and cost.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) In those cases in which the property upon which the lien exists is owned by a subsequent purchaser, the petition for relief shall be that the court determine the amount due and that the property upon which the lien exists may be sold in the manner provided in this act to satisfy the taxes, interest, and costs of the proceeding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The information may contain other and further allegations and petitions considered material and permitted by the rules and practice of the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10)   A certified copy of the order of determination of the inheritance tax, for which the lien exists, certified by either the judge or register of probate of the court that determined the tax or by the revenue commissioner, may be attached to the information. When attached, the copy shall be considered a part of the information and shall be prima facie evidence of the determination of the inheritance tax and the accruing of the lien against the property. A certificate of the revenue commissioner stating that the inheritance tax, or any part of the tax determined upon the transfer of the property upon which the lien exists, has not been paid, may be attached to the information. When attached, the certificate shall be considered a part of the information and shall be prima facie evidence of the nonpayment of the amount of the tax and interest shown to be unpaid by the certificate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11)   If an infant, insane, or otherwise mentally incompetent person has an interest in the property upon which the lien exists, service of process shall be made upon that person in the same manner and with the same effect as upon persons not under a disability, whether the infant, insane, or otherwise mentally incompetent person is within or without the jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12)   After the issuing and service of process against the infant, insane, or otherwise incompetent person, a guardian ad litem may be appointed for the infant, insane, or otherwise incompetent person by the court upon motion of the attorney general, or the guardian ad litem may be appointed by the court upon the request of the infant, and in the case of an insane or otherwise incompetent person, at the request of the person's general guardian.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13)   If upon the hearing of the cause it appears that the inheritance taxes or interest, or both, upon the transfer of the property upon which the lien exists have not been paid, the court shall decree the amount of taxes and interest on the taxes found to be due, together with costs to be determined by the court, to be paid by the person or persons owning the property, or any interest in the property, within 3 months after the entry of the decree and that in default of payment that the property upon which the lien exists, be sold to satisfy the taxes, interest, and costs. If it appears that the person or persons to whom was transferred the property by will or under the intestate laws have parted with their interest before the institution of the proceedings provided for in this section, and that the property is owned by a subsequent purchaser, the court shall decree that the property be sold to satisfy the taxes, interest, and costs, unless the owner satisfies the taxes, interest, and costs within 3 months after the entry of the decree. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) In cases in which it appears that 2 or more pieces or parcels of land were transferred by will or under the intestate laws to 1 person, and that that person, before the institution of the proceedings provided for in this section, has parted with any or all of the pieces or parcels of land, and that the court can ascertain from the order of determination the amount of inheritance tax determined upon the transfer of each piece or parcel, and that the lien against all of the pieces or parcels is being foreclosed in 1 proceeding, the court may decree the sale of that piece or parcel to satisfy the amount of tax determined upon the transfer of that piece or parcel, together with the interest thereon and pro rata costs of the proceeding. A piece or parcel of property shall not be sold to satisfy taxes, interest, and costs within 3 months after the entry of the decree.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) If the person or persons owning the property or an interest in the property, or the person's heirs, executors, administrators, or a person lawfully claiming  under  that person, within 6 months after the  date of the sale redeems the entire premises sold, by paying to the register of deeds in whose office the deed is deposited, as provided by subsection  (20), for the benefit of the purchaser, or the purchaser's executors, administrators, or assigns the sum which was bid  on the date of sale, with interest, at the rate of 6%, together with the sum of $1.00 as a fee for the care and custody of the redemption money, and the fee paid by the purchaser for recording his or her deed, then the deed  is void.  If a distinct lot or parcel separately sold is redeemed leaving a portion of the premises unredeemed, then the deed shall be  void only to the parcel or parcels redeemed. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) The register of deeds shall not determine the amount necessary for redemption. The purchaser shall attach an affidavit with the deed to be recorded that states the exact amount required to redeem the property under subsection (15), including any daily per diem amounts, and the date by which the property must be redeemed shall be stated in the certificate of the commissioner or other person making the sale. The purchaser may include in the affidavit the name of a designee responsible on behalf of the purchaser to assist the person redeeming the property in computing the exact amount required to redeem the property. The designee may charge a fee as stated in the affidavit and may be authorized by the purchaser to receive redemption funds. The purchaser shall accept the amount computed by the designee. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17)   If it appears to the court after the expiration of 3 months from the date of entry of the decree from a certificate of the state of Michigan to whom the taxes, interest, penalties, and costs were to be paid, attached to a petition of the attorney general for an order of sale of the property, that the same have not been paid, the court shall enter an order directing the circuit court commissioner, or some other person duly authorized by the order of the court, to sell the property. The sale shall be at public vendue between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. at the courthouse or at another place as the court directs, within 60 days after the date of the order and on the date specified on the order. The court may, if necessary, by further order adjourn the sale from time to time. The circuit court commissioner, or other person authorized to make the sale, may, if bids are not received equal to the amount of taxes, interest, and costs, adjourn the sale from time to time, but the sale shall not be adjourned for more than 60 days at any 1 time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18)   Upon receipt of a certified copy of the order of sale the circuit court commissioner, or other person duly authorized by the order of the court to conduct the sale, shall publish the sale in some newspaper printed in the county or another paper as the court may direct, once in each week, for 3 weeks in succession. If the sale is adjourned by order of the court, or by the circuit court commissioner, or other person duly authorized by the order of the court, to conduct the sale the same publication shall be had of the order or notice adjourning the sale as is provided in this section for publishing the order of sale. Proof of publication shall be filed with the court before the sale.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19)   The circuit court commissioner, or other person authorized to make the sale shall make and file a report of the sale. The report shall be entitled in the court and cause, and shall be certified and filed with the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20)   Deeds shall thereupon be executed by the circuit court commissioner or other person making the sale, specifying the names of the parties in the action, the date of the determination of the inheritance tax, the name of the deceased, the county in which the estate was probated, with a description of the premises and the amount for which each parcel of land described was sold. The commissioner, or other person making the sale, shall indorse upon each deed when the deed shall become operative, if the premises are not redeemed according to law. The deed or deeds, as soon as practicable and within 20 days after the sale, shall be deposited with the register of deeds of the county in which the land described is situated, and the register shall indorse on the deed the time the deed was received, shall record the deed at length in a book to be provided for in his or her office for that purpose, and shall index the deed in the regular index of deeds. The fees for recording the deed shall be paid by the purchaser and be included among the other costs and expenses. If the premises or a parcel of the premises shall be redeemed, the register of deeds shall write on the face of the record the word "Redeemed", stating at what date the entry is made and signing the entry with his or her official signature. Unless the premises described in the deed, or a parcel of the premises, is redeemed within the time limited for redemption, as provided in this section, the deed shall thereupon as to all parcels not redeemed, become operative and shall vest in the grantee named in the deed, the grantee's heirs or assigns all the right, title, and interest therein which the person or persons received either from the deceased by reason of the transfer to them by will or under the intestate laws, or as subsequent purchasers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21)   The proceeds of each sale provided for in this section shall be paid to the treasurer of the county where the estate was probated, to be applied to the discharge of the tax, interest, penalty, and costs, and if there is any surplus, it shall be brought into court for the use of the defendant, or the person entitled  to the money, subject to the order of the court. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) The circuit court commissioner, or other person authorized by the court to make the sale, shall be entitled to only the following fees:  For attending and adjourning a sale, $1.00; for attending and making a sale, $1.50; mileage, 1 way, 10 cents per mile; executing deed or deeds on real estate sales, 25 cents for each deed necessarily executed; making and filing a report of sale, $1.00. The cost of publishing any legal notices required to be published shall be at the rate of 70 cents per folio for the first insertion, and 35 cents per folio for each subsequent insertion. The fees which are provided for in this act shall be added by the circuit court commissioner, or other person duly authorized to make the sale, to the tax, interest, penalties, and costs awarded by the court as charges against the land.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(23) The amount stated in any affidavits recorded under this section shall be the amount necessary to satisfy the requirements for redemption under this section.</div>

<P>Sec. 4.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The tax imposed by this act accrues on the date of death and is due and payable on or before the expiration of 9 months after the date of death for a decedent dying before January 1, 1992 or, for a decedent dying after December 31, 1991, 105 days after the date of death or September 1, 1992, whichever is later. For a decedent dying after December 31, 1991, taxes are delinquent if paid after 105 days after the date of death or September 1, 1992, whichever is later. For a decedent dying after December 31, 1991, a penalty of 8% of the tax is added to the tax, if delinquent, for failure to pay the tax required by this act by the due date required under this subsection. For failure or refusal to pay the tax required by this act within 9 months from the accruing thereof, there is added an additional penalty of $5.00 or 5% of the tax, whichever is greater, if the failure is for not more than 1 month or a fraction of 1 month, with an additional 5% for each additional month or fraction of a month during which the failure continues, or the tax and penalty are not paid, to a maximum of 25%. For failure to pay the tax by the due date, in addition to the penalty, there is added interest at the rate of 3/4 of 1% per month on the amount of the tax from the time the tax was accrued until the date of payment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If by reason of claims made upon the estate, necessary litigation, or other unavoidable cause of delay, the tax cannot be completely determined and paid, a partial or interim payment of not less than 50% of the total tax liability, together with a request for extension, shall be made before the due date. If the department of treasury grants the request for extension, the 8% penalty under subsection (1) is waived and an additional payment of not less than 25% of the total tax liability shall be made before 9 months from the date of death. Interest at the rate of 3/4 of 1% per month is added to the amount of tax unpaid for the period of extension until the tax is determined or could be determined. If the balance of the tax due remains unpaid for more than 30 days from the date the tax is determined or could be determined, there is added a penalty of $5.00 or 5% of the tax not paid, whichever is greater, if the failure is for not more than 1 month or a fraction of 1 month, with an additional 5% for each additional month or fraction of a month during which the failure continues, or the tax and penalty are not paid, to a maximum of 25%. In addition to the penalty, there is added interest at the rate of 3/4 of 1% per month on the amount of the tax from the time the tax was determined or could have been determined until the date of payment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If payment is deferred as provided in section 7, interest is charged at the rate of 3/4 of 1% per month from the accrual of the tax until the date of payment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   For failure or refusal to file an information return or information report required by this act, within the time specified by this act, there is added a penalty of $5.00 per day for each day for each separate failure or refusal. The total penalty for each separate failure or refusal shall not exceed $200.00.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a return, report, or remittance is filed after the time specified by this act and it is shown to the satisfaction of the department that the failure to file was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the penalty may be waived.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The administrator, personal representative, executor, or trustee of each estate shall file a form, as prescribed by the department, containing data required for the proper administration of the tax not later than the due date or within the period of extension granted under subsection (2). The filing of this form may be waived by the department of treasury.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 5.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Every executor, administrator, trustee or other person shall have full power to sell or mortgage so much of the property of the decedent as will enable him or her to pay such tax in the same manner as he or she might be entitled by law to do for the payment of the debts of a decedent or ward; except that in cases where the transfer is to 2 or more persons in common, and 1 or more of them shall have paid his or her proportion of such tax, such executor, administrator, trustee, or other person shall sell or mortgage only the interest of such of the persons to whom the property was transferred as have not paid the tax, to pay the tax due upon such share or shares. Any such administrator, executor, trustee or other person having in charge or in trust any legacy or property for distribution subject to such tax, shall deduct the tax therefrom; and within 30 days thereafter shall pay over the same to the state of Michigan as herein provided. If such legacy or property be not in money, he or she shall collect the tax thereon as determined by the judge of probate from the person entitled thereto, unless such tax has been paid to the state of Michigan. He or she shall not deliver or be compelled to deliver any specific legacy or property subject to tax under this act to any person until the tax assessed thereon has been paid to him or her or to the state of Michigan. If any such legacy shall be charged upon or payable out of real property and is taxable under this act, the devisee charged with the payment of such legacy shall deduct such tax therefrom and pay it to the state of Michigan or the administrator, executor or trustee. And the payment thereof shall be enforced by the executor, administrator or trustee, in the same manner as payment of the legacy might be enforced, or by the attorney general or prosecuting attorney by the appropriate legal proceeding. If such legacy shall be given in money to any such person for a limited period, the administrator, executor, trustee or other person shall retain the tax upon the whole amount, but if not in money, he or she shall make such application to the court having jurisdiction of an accounting by him or her, to make an apportionment, if the case require it, of the sum to be paid by such legatee and for such further order relative thereto as the case may require.</DIV>

When any amount of said tax shall have been paid erroneously to the state of Michigan by reason of the allowance of debts or otherwise, it shall be lawful for the state treasurer, upon satisfactory proof by the order or certificate of the proper court of the allowance of the debts or of the reversal, correction or alteration, in accordance with law, of the order fixing the tax, to draw his or her warrant upon the state treasury for the erroneous payment, to be refunded to the executor, administrator, trustee, person or persons entitled to receive it, and charge the warrant to the fund which receives credit from the payment of taxes under the provisions of this act. However, applications for the refunding of erroneous tax shall be made within 6 months from the allowance of the debts or the reversal, correction or alteration of the order.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The judge of probate, upon the application of any interested party, including the state treasurer and county treasurers, or upon his or her own motion, shall, as often as and whenever occasion may require, appoint a competent person as appraiser to fix the clear market value at the time of the transfer of property which shall be subject to the payment of any tax imposed by this act. A description of the property and the names and residences of the persons to whom it passes shall be given by the judge of probate to the appraiser. If the property, upon the transfer of which the tax is imposed, is an estate, income or interest for a term of years or for life, or determinable upon any future or contingent estate, or is a remainder or reversion or other expectancy, real or personal, the entire property or fund by which the estate, income or interest is supported, or of which it is a part, shall be appraised immediately after the transfer, or as soon thereafter as may be practicable, at the clear market value as of that date. If the estate, income or interest is of such a nature that its clear market value cannot be ascertained at that time, it shall be appraised in like manner at the time when the value first became ascertainable. The value of every future or contingent or limited estate, income, interest or annuity, dependent upon any life or lives in being, shall be determined by the rule, method or standard of mortality and value employed by the commissioner of the office of insurance and financial services in ascertaining the value of policies of life insurance companies, except that the rate of interest for computing the present value of all future and contingent interests or estates shall be 5% per annum. The commissioner of the office of insurance and financial services shall, upon request of the state treasurer, prepare the tables of values, expectancies and other matters as may be necessary for use in computing, under the provisions of this act, the value of life estates, annuities, reversions and remainders, which shall be printed and furnished by the auditor general to the several judges of probate upon request. The clear market value of the transfer of a money legacy, presently taxable, shall for the purposes of this act be taken to be the face value of the money at the date of death of decedent.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 13.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The report of the appraiser shall be filed in the office of the judge of probate, and from such report and other proof relating to any estate before the judge of probate, the judge of probate shall forthwith, as of course, determine the clear market value of all estates as of the date of transfer, and the amount of tax to which the same is liable, or the judge of probate may so determine the clear market value of all estates and the amount of tax to which the same are liable without appointing an appraiser. The judge of probate may, and shall on application of the attorney general or commissioner of revenue, require the executor, administrator or trustee of any estate to file with him or her a petition containing an itemized statement, under oath, of the personal property and real property within his or her knowledge or possession or under his or her control as executor, administrator or trustee, which statement shall indicate the date from which interest and dividends were due and unpaid upon each item of the personal estate, together with the rate of such interest and also of the amount and character of any encumbrances upon such real estate at the time of the death of the deceased, and other data, such as debts, expenses of administration and other charges which constitute proper deductions in reaching a taxable remainder under the provisions of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The judge of probate before final determination of the tax upon the estate of decedent, may make a partial determination of tax upon any legacies or devises, or upon the real estate of a decedent, or upon the estate of the decedent as a whole, and may authorize and direct any executor or administrator to pay to the state of Michigan a sum in gross on account of the inheritance tax due from the estate when by reason of claims made against the estate, litigation, nonreceipt of final determinations made in federal estate tax returns or other unavoidable cause of delay, the tax cannot be completely determined by the court within either 105 days of the date of death or 9 months from its accrual. The judge of probate in the order determining the tax upon such estate shall state the amount authorized to be paid in gross and the date of such order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The commissioner of insurance, on the application of any judge of probate, or the commissioner of revenue, shall determine the value of any future or contingent estate, income or interest limited, contingent, dependent or determinable upon the life or lives of persons in being, upon the facts contained in any appraiser's report, or facts stated by the judge of probate, and certify the same to the commissioner of revenue or the judge of probate, and his or her certificate shall be prima facie evidence that the method of computation adopted therein is correct.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The judge of probate shall immediately give notice upon the final determination by him or her of the value of any estate which is taxable under this act, and of the tax to which the same is liable, to each heir, legatee or devisee or his or her attorney and of the tax assessed upon his or her share of the estate, by mailing such notice postage prepaid to the last known address of each such persons, or his or her attorney except those who were in court in person or by attorney at the time the tax was so determined.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The judge of probate upon the written application of any person interested, filed with him or her within 90 days after the final determination by him or her of any tax under this act, may grant a rehearing upon the matter of determining such tax. The attorney general may file the written application for rehearing upon the matter of determining such tax any time prior to the allowance of the final account. If the state appeals from the appraisement, assessment or determination of the tax, it shall not be necessary to give any bond. If, on rehearing, the judge shall modify his or her former determination he or she shall enter an order redetermining the tax, and make the necessary entries in the book provided for in section 17, and make report thereof to the commissioner of revenue and county treasurer as provided in section 18.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 14.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If the state treasurer or the treasurer of any county shall have reason to believe that any tax is due and unpaid under this act, after the refusal or neglect of the persons liable therefor to pay the same, he or she shall notify the attorney general in writing of that failure or neglect, and the attorney general may apply, or cause the prosecuting attorney of the county to apply, in behalf of the state, to the probate court for an order requiring the persons liable to pay the tax to appear before the court on a day specified, not more than 3 months after the date of the order, and show cause why the tax should not be paid. The judge of probate upon such application, and whenever it shall appear to him or her that any such tax accruing under this act has not been paid as required by law, shall issue a citation, and the service of a citation, and the time, manner, and proof of the citation and the hearing and determination of the citation, and the enforcement of the determination or order made by the judge of probate shall conform to the practice of the probate court in like cases made and provided for the service of citations out of the probate court, and the hearing and determination thereon and its enforcement, so far as the same may be applicable. In all cases where an estate has been declared closed without fixing or payment of the tax upon the transfers therein, and the attorney general believes that the transfers are subject to a tax and the real estate in the estate is subject to a lien and anticipates the institution of proceedings for the fixing and enforcing, or the enforcing of the lien when it has been fixed, he or she may file with the register of deeds of the county a notice setting forth the fact together with a description of the real estate claimed to be subject to the lien which shall operate with the same force and effect as a lis pendens under existing statutes. However, the failure to file such notice shall not in any manner prejudice the rights of the state. The judge of probate or the probate clerk or register shall, upon the request of the attorney general, prosecuting attorney, or treasurer of the county, furnish 1 or more transcripts of such decree which shall be docketed and filed by the county clerk of any county of the state without fees, in the same manner and with the same effect as provided by law for filing and docketing transcripts, judgments, and decrees of circuit courts in this state. As a cumulative remedy for the collection of the tax, the state may proceed by an action of assumpsit in any court of competent jurisdiction. Whenever the probate judge issues a citation and undertakes the proceedings specified in this section, he or she shall certify that fact to the county treasurer, together with an itemized bill of all expenses incurred for the services of the citation, and other lawful disbursements not otherwise paid. Upon receipt of the bill, the county treasurer shall pay the bill from the general or contingent fund of the county. In all proceedings to which any county treasurer, or the state treasurer, is cited to appear under sections 11 and 12 of this act and all proceedings arising or instituted under this section, the attorney general shall represent the interests of the state, the compensation and expenses of necessary assistants and the expenses of the attorney general to be paid after approval by the attorney general on the warrant of the state treasurer out of the general fund in the state treasury.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The state treasurer shall furnish to each judge of probate a book, which shall be a public record, in which the judge of probate shall enter a formal order containing the name of every decedent upon whose estate letters of administration or letters testamentary or ancillary letters have issued, the date of death, and place of residence at the time of death of the decedent, the names, places of residence and relationship to the decedent of his or her heirs at law, in case the decedent died intestate or left estate not disposed of by will; the names, places of residence, and relationship to the decedent of the legatees and devisees in the will of the decedent, in case the decedent died testate, the ages of all life tenants and beneficiaries under life estates, the clear market value of the decedent's real and personal property, the clear market value of the property, real and personal, passing to each heir, legatee and devisee, and the clear market value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, and other property of the decedent, or given by the decedent in his or her will and otherwise, as fixed and determined by the judge of probate, and the amount of tax assessed thereon, and the amount of tax assessed on the share of each heir, legatee and devisee, when from the records of the court or the testimony given there appears to be property in such estate liable to tax under this act. However, a description of real estate need not be given unless the real estate is taxable under this act, in which case a sufficiently definite description shall be given to fully identify the taxable real estate and the persons to whom the several parcels are devised. The judge of probate shall also enter in the book the name, date of death, and place of residence at time of death of every decedent, grantor, vendor or donor who has made a transfer of property in contemplation of death or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his or her death, subject to tax under this act; the name and residence of the grantee, vendee or donee and his or her relationship to the grantor, vendor or donor, the clear market value as determined by the judge of probate of the property so transferred by him or her and the tax determined by the court payable thereon. These entries shall be made from data contained in the papers filed in the probate court and testimony taken in any proceedings relating to the estate of the decedent. The judge of probate shall also enter in the book the amount of the real and personal property of the decedent as shown by the inventory thereof when made and filed in his or her office. If the judge of probate determines the amount of tax to be paid upon any legacies or devises or upon the real estate of a decedent or upon the estate of the decedent as a whole before the final determination of the tax by him or her, only such entries need be made in the book in that particular case as refer to the partial determination, and it shall be distinctly stated in the book that it is but a partial determination by the judge of probate of the tax due from the estate. Whenever the determination of the tax in such estate by the judge of probate is general, partial or final, the deductions made by the judge of probate from the full value of the estate shall be particularly specified, so that the several reasons for the deductions made clearly appear upon the record. The record required to be furnished by the state treasurer shall be in the following form, and shall be of such size and so arranged as he or she determines will best meet the requirements of this act:</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 18.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Each judge of probate shall, within 3 days after he shall have determined the tax and entered the order required in the preceding section, make a duly certified copy of such order upon forms furnished by the department of revenue containing all the data and matter required, 1 of which shall be immediately delivered to the county treasurer, from which data the said county treasurer shall obtain the information for making the duplicate receipt required by this act, and the other transmitted to the department of revenue. If in any calendar quarter beginning January, April, July or October first in each year, there has been no tax determined, the judge of probate shall make a report to the department of revenue affirmatively showing this fact. The register of deeds of each county shall, upon blanks prescribed and furnished by the department of revenue, as often as any deed or other conveyance is filed or recorded in his office of any property which appears to have been made in contemplation of death or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of the grantor or vendor, make reports in duplicate containing a statement of the name and place of residence of such grantor or vendor, the name, relationship and place of residence of the grantee or vendee, and a description and the value of the property transferred and the consideration for the transfer as stated in the instrument filed or recorded, 1 of which duplicates shall be immediately delivered to the county treasurer, and the other transmitted to the department of revenue. Whenever any non-resident shall die leaving property or any interest therein, in this state which has not been duly administered under the laws of this state and it shall be necessary to have the question of the taxation of the transfer thereof determined, such question may be presented and determined upon petition of the department of revenue to be filed by the attorney general in any probate court of this state. In any such case where the department of revenue is satisfied from the proofs submitted or obtained as hereinafter provided, that such transfer is not taxable the department of revenue may thereupon issue a waiver with respect thereto which, upon being countersigned by the attorney general, his deputy, or assistant, shall operate as a determination that such transfer is not taxable. The department of revenue shall charge and collect in advance a fee of $1.00 for each such waiver and keep a proper record thereof. The said petition shall set forth the name of decedent; residence at time of death; and total amount of property constituting said estate; a description of and the value of all property in Michigan; and any and all such other data as may be necessary to inform the court of the facts in connection with such matter. It shall be the duty of the probate court with which such petition is filed to fix a date for hearing thereon and to give notice of such hearing in such manner as shall be prescribed. Publication of the notice of such hearing shall not be necessary unless ordered by the court. It shall be the duty of the executor, administrator, trustee or any interested party in said estate to furnish all such facts, data, information, reports and certified copies of proceedings had in connection with said estate in any other court, as shall be required by the attorney general or department of revenue or directed by the probate court. The probate court shall appoint a resident of Michigan to represent the said estate at such hearing and the person so appointed shall perform such duties as shall be required by the court. The person so appointed shall have and possess all of the powers of an executor or administrator for the purposes of this section, but shall not be personally liable for any inheritance tax in said estate and shall not be required to give any bond unless so directed by the court. The said probate court shall at the hearing on said petition or at an adjourned hearing, determine whether the transfer of such property is taxable and, if found taxable, he shall proceed as in all other cases to fix and determine the amount thereof. If it is found that the transfer of such property is not taxable, an order to that effect shall be entered in the said probate court. A redetermination of said order may be had and an appeal therefrom may be taken in the same manner provided for in this act. A certified copy of all such orders determining that there is no inheritance tax due and payable may be procured from the probate court upon the payment of 50 cents. No order shall be entered in any such case until there is filed in said probate court receipts showing full payment of all expenses incurred including compensation due the person appointed to represent said estate, all of which expenses or compensation shall be paid by the executor, administrator or any person interested in said estate. In case it may be necessary to have any such property subjected to regular probate proceedings in this state, or if any such estate shall have been administered in this state, the right to proceed under this section shall be discretionary with the probate court. This section shall not operate to relieve any such person, as is referred to in section 9c of this act from the liability therein expressed until 60 days after the date of entry of the order determining that there is no tax upon the transfers in said estate, or in case a tax is determined, until proper receipts showing payment thereof as required in section 3 of this act have been duly signed. No proceedings shall be required and no inheritance tax shall be fixed and determined or collected, and no waivers or consents shall be required for the transfer or delivery of intangible personal property of a nonresident decedent. The department of revenue may prescribe or approve a form of affidavit which may be relied upon by corporations or their transfer agents in making delivery or transfer of intangible personal property in accordance with this act.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 41.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upon payment of the tax under this act, the department shall issue to the personal representative receipts in triplicate, each of which is sufficient evidence of payment and entitles the personal representative to be credited and allowed that amount by the probate court having jurisdiction. If the personal representative files a complete return and makes a written application to the department for determination of the amount of the tax and discharge from personal liability for the tax, the department as soon as possible, but not later than 1 year after receipt of the application, shall notify the personal representative of the amount of the tax. Upon payment of the tax, the personal representative is discharged from personal liability for any additional tax found to be due and is entitled to receive from the department a receipt in writing showing the discharge. The department shall prepare the discharge of liability receipt in a form recordable by the register of deeds. However, a discharge does not operate to release the gross estate of the lien of any additional tax subsequently found to be due while the title to the gross estate remains in the personal representative or in the heirs, devisees, or distributees. If after a discharge is given the title to any portion of the gross estate has passed to a bona fide purchaser for value, that portion of the gross estate is not subject to a lien or any claim or demand for the tax.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The tax imposed under section 32 is a lien upon the gross estate of the decedent until paid in full.

Any real estate that is part of the gross estate of a decedent transferred to a bona fide purchaser or mortgagee is divested of the lien, the lien attaches to the consideration received for the real property, and the department shall issue a waiver releasing the property from the lien in a form recordable with the register of deeds if 1 or more of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The transfer of the real estate is necessary for payment of claims against the estate and expenses of administration even though other assets are then available for sale or mortgage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The department is satisfied that no tax liability exists or that the tax liability of an estate has been fully discharged or provided for.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Except when the department has filed a notice of tax lien with the county in which the real estate is located, a partial payment is made with the department of an amount equal to either of the following, whichever is applicable:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   If the transfer occurs before the due date for the filing of the return including extensions, 8% of the net cash proceeds payable at closing to the seller for a sale or to the mortgagor for a mortgage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   If the transfer occurs after the due date for the filing of the return including extensions, 16% of the net cash proceeds payable at closing to the seller for a sale or to the mortgagor for a mortgage, or the amount of the unpaid tax as reflected on the return filed with the department, whichever is less.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The seller, purchaser, or mortgagee makes a partial payment of an amount determined by the department to be sufficient to ensure payment of the tax. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The seller, purchaser, or mortgagee makes a partial payment of an amount determined by the probate court to be sufficient to ensure payment of the tax.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The seller or mortgagor is a person who holds the real property as a surviving joint tenant or tenant by the entireties.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in subsections (2), (3), and (4), the severance tax required to be paid by each producer at the time of rendering each monthly report, or by a pipeline company, common carrier, or common purchaser, for and on behalf of a producer, shall be in the amount of 5% of the gross cash market value of the total production of gas or 6.6% of the gross cash market value of the total production of oil during the preceding monthly period, exclusive of the production or proceeds from the production attributable to this state, the government of the United States, or a political subdivision of this state or government of the United States. The value of all production shall be computed as of the time when and at the place where the production was severed or taken from the soil immediately after the severance. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the payment of the severance tax shall be required of each producer. If the production is sold or delivered to a pipeline company and is transported by the pipeline company through lines connected with the oil or gas well of the owner, or of a common purchaser, the pipeline company, or common purchaser shall receive and accept all the oil and gas, subject to a lien, and the pipeline company shall withhold out of the proceeds or price to be paid for the products severed, the proportionate parts of the tax due by the respective owners of the oil and gas at the time of severance and, at the time required for the filing of the monthly reports required in section 2, shall pay to the department of treasury all the tax money collected or withheld. Each pipeline company, common carrier, or common purchaser shall deduct from the purchase price paid to a producer from whom it may receive the oil or gas the amount of the severance tax levied in this section before making the payment. If under the terms of a contract the pipeline company, common carrier, or common purchaser is required to reimburse a producer of oil or gas for the amount of the severance tax or a part of the severance tax, the tax reimbursement shall not be considered a part of the gross cash market value of the total production of the oil or gas.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The severance tax required to be paid by each producer at the time of rendering each monthly report, or by a pipeline company, common carrier, or common purchaser, for and on behalf of a producer, on stripper well crude oil, as defined in former section 8 of the emergency petroleum allocation act of 1973, 15 USC 757 and on crude oil from marginal properties as defined in former part 212, subpart D, of chapter II of title 10 of the code of federal regulations 10 CFR 212.72 to 212.77, shall be in the amount of 4% of the gross cash market value of the total production of the oil, during the preceding monthly period, exclusive of the production or proceeds from the production attributable to this state, the government of the United States, or a political subdivision of this state or government of the United States. The value of all production shall be computed as of the time when and at the place where the production was severed or taken from the soil immediately after the severance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A producer is not required to pay a severance tax on income received from the hydrocarbons produced from devonian or antrim shale qualifying for the nonconventional fuel credit contained in section 45k of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 45k and acquired pursuant to a royalty interest sold by this state under section 503 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.503.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) For carbon dioxide secondary or enhanced recovery projects approved after March 30, 2014, the severance tax required to be paid by each producer at the time of rendering each monthly report, on oil or gas produced from a carbon dioxide secondary or enhanced recovery project, shall be 4.0% of the gross cash market value for oil and 4.0% of the gross cash market value for gas. This subsection does not apply to a producer convicted of an antitrust violation or conspiracy to commit an antitrust violation that is a crime under the laws of this state.</div>

A person shall not make a remote retail sale to a consumer in this state unless that person is licensed under this act as an unclassified acquirer. A license granted under this act is not assignable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Upon proper application and the payment of the applicable fee, and subject to subsection (6), the department shall issue a license to each manufacturer, wholesaler, secondary wholesaler, vending machine operator, unclassified acquirer, transportation company, or transporter. The application must be on a form prescribed by the department and signed under penalty of perjury. The application must state the applicant's regular business hours. Except for transportation companies, each place of business must be separately licensed. If a person acts in more than 1 capacity at any 1 place of business, a license must be procured for each capacity. Each machine for vending tobacco products is considered a place of retail business. Each license or a duplicate copy must be prominently displayed on the premises covered by the license. In the case of vending machines, a disc or marker furnished by the department showing it to be licensed must be attached to the front of the machine in a place clearly visible to the public.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A person shall not possess a machine for vending tobacco products for a period in excess of 72 hours, or operate a machine for vending tobacco products, unless there is a disc or marker attached as provided by this section.

If the applicant carries on another business in conjunction with the secure nonresidential facility, the other business must also be identified.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) United States citizenship or eligibility to obtain employment within the United States if not a citizen. If the applicant is not an individual, the controlling shareholders, partners, directors, and principal officers shall be United States citizens or eligible to obtain employment within the United States if not a citizen.</div>

The department may also require a licensee under this section to file a financial statement with the department showing all assets and liabilities and any other information the department may prescribe, to be filed within 30 days after the date requested.

A retailer shall keep as part of the records a true copy of all purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading, and other written matter substantiating the purchase or acquisition of each tobacco product and related to any tobacco products subject to subsection (15), if applicable, at the location where the tobacco product is offered for sale for a period of 4 months from the date of purchase or acquisition. The department may, by giving prior written approval, authorize a person licensed under this act or a retailer to maintain records in a manner other than that required by this subsection. Other records shall be kept by these persons as the department reasonably prescribes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A manufacturer, wholesaler, unclassified acquirer, and secondary wholesaler shall deliver with each sale or consignment of a tobacco product a written statement containing the name or trade name and address of both the seller and the purchaser, the date of delivery, the quantity, and the trade name or brand of the tobacco product, correctly itemizing the prices paid for each brand purchased, and shall retain a duplicate of each statement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A vending machine operator shall keep a detailed record of each vending machine owned for the sale of tobacco products showing the location of the machine, the date of placing the machine on the location, the quantity of each tobacco product placed in the machine, the date when placed there, and the amount of the commission paid or earned on sales through the vending machine. When filling or refilling the vending machine, the operator shall deliver to the owner or tenant occupying the premises where the machine is located a written statement containing the operator's own name and address, the name and address of the owner or the tenant, the date when the machine was filled, and the quantity of each brand of tobacco product sold from the machine since the date when tobacco products were last placed in the machine. A person in possession of premises where a vending machine is located shall keep a record of each tobacco product sold through the vending machine located on the premises and the amount of commission paid by the person operating the vending machine. The records must consist of written statements required to be given by each person operating a vending machine for the sale of tobacco products as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A licensee under this act shall not issue or accept a written statement or invoice that is known to the licensee to contain a statement or omission that falsely indicates the name of the customer, the type, trade name, or brand of merchandise, the quantity of each type, trade name, or brand of merchandise, the prices, the discounts, the date of the transaction, or the terms of sale. A person shall not use a device or game of chance to aid, promote, or induce sales or purchases of a tobacco product, or give a tobacco product in connection with a device or game of chance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (6), all statements and other records required by this section must be in a form prescribed by the department and must be preserved for a period of 4 years from the date of purchase or acquisition of the tobacco product and offered for inspection at any time upon oral or written demand by the department or its authorized agent by every wholesaler, secondary wholesaler, vending machine operator, unclassified acquirer, and retailer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A licensee or retailer in possession or control of a tobacco product that has not preserved the statements and records required by this section because the licensee or retailer claims the tobacco product was purchased or acquired more than 4 years ago has the burden of proving that the tobacco product was purchased or acquired more than 4 years ago. A licensee or retailer that fails to preserve documentation sufficient to meet this burden of proof is in violation of the record-keeping requirements under this section for that tobacco product.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A shipping case or container of a tobacco product other than cigarettes received or acquired within this state by a wholesaler or unclassified acquirer from a manufacturer or any person located outside this state must bear either the name and address of the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer that made the first purchase of that shipping case or container or any other markings the department prescribes. The point at which a shipping case or container is considered to be received or acquired in this state is to be determined based on the facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Ownership of the shipping case or container when it enters this state's borders or when it is delivered to the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The risk of loss.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The use of a common carrier or a vehicle owned or leased by the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer to import or transport the shipping case or container into this state or deliver the shipping case or container to the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A wholesaler or unclassified acquirer, licensed under this act, shall place or otherwise affix the markings prescribed by the department on every shipping case or container of a tobacco product other than cigarettes that is sold, transferred, shipped, or delivered by the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer to a retailer or another licensee, in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If a marking prescribed by the department is to be affixed to a shipping case or container of tobacco products other than cigarettes by means of a mechanical or other device that applies the marking, the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer must obtain prior approval from the department to purchase, possess, or otherwise be permitted to use such a device. A wholesaler or unclassified acquirer whose license is revoked, is terminated, or has expired shall return all such devices in its possession to the department within 60 days of the revocation, termination, or expiration of its license. In addition to any other fine or any civil or criminal penalty or charge allowed by law, a wholesaler or unclassified acquirer that fails to return each device in its possession as required by this subsection is liable for a fine of $500.00 for each device not timely returned.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The markings required by this section on shipping cases and containers of tobacco products other than cigarettes must not be affixed in a manner that makes the markings illegible or that covers up, in whole or in part, or that otherwise obstructs or makes illegible the information or markings described in subsection (7).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If a tobacco product other than cigarettes is found in a place of business or otherwise in the possession of a wholesaler, secondary wholesaler, vending machine operator, unclassified acquirer, transporter, or retailer without the markings prescribed by the department or the information required by this section on the shipping case or container of the tobacco product, if required by this section, or if an individual package of cigarettes is found without a stamp affixed as provided under this act or if a tobacco product is found, or was acquired, imported, transferred, or sold, without proper substantiation by invoices or other records as required by this section, the presumption shall be that the tobacco product is kept in violation of this act and constitutes contraband subject to seizure and forfeiture under section 9. Notwithstanding anything in this act to the contrary, if any tobacco product is adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been lawfully seized under this act, and if the adjudication of lawful seizure survives the exhaustion or lapse of any appeal rights, the tobacco product shall be automatically forfeited to this state and the person from whom that tobacco product was seized shall be liable for the tax imposed under this act on that tobacco product.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If a tobacco product is to be or is being transported on a public highway, road, or street in this state for shipment outside this state, as indicated by the bills of lading, invoices, packing slips, or other documentation related to that shipment, the licensee shipping the tobacco product shall cause to be placed on every shipping case or container in which the tobacco product is shipped the name and address of the consignee or purchaser to whom the shipment is made outside of the state and, for tobacco products other than cigarettes, the marking prescribed by the department unless the shipping case or other container already bears that marking from the licensee. A tobacco product that was located in this state is considered to have been shipped outside this state for purposes of this subsection if the tobacco product crosses the border of this state regardless of whether the tobacco product is delivered to or accepted by the consignee or purchaser to whom the shipment is made outside this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The department may require reports from a common carrier who transports a tobacco product to a point within this state from another person who, under contract, transports a tobacco product, or from a bonded warehouseperson or bailee who has in his or her possession a tobacco product. A carrier, bailee, warehouseperson, or other person shall permit the inspection of the tobacco products and examination by the department or its duly authorized agent of any records relating to the shipment of a tobacco product into, from, or within this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (15), any person transporting, possessing, or acquiring for the purpose of transporting a tobacco product upon a public highway, road, or street of this state shall be licensed under this act as a transporter, unless that person is licensed under this act as an unclassified acquirer, wholesaler, transportation company, vending machine operator, or secondary wholesaler, and shall have in the person's actual possession invoices or bills of lading containing the name and address of both the seller and the purchaser, the actual or estimated date of delivery, the person's name and address, the quantity and trade name or brand of each tobacco product, the price paid for each trade name or brand in the person's possession or custody, and a copy of the license as prescribed under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) Notwithstanding anything in this act to the contrary, a retailer in this state, or other person acting on behalf of a retailer in this state, is not required to be licensed under this act to transport a tobacco product upon a public highway, road, or street of this state for the purpose of delivering a tobacco product to a consumer in this state if all of the following conditions are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The tobacco product was purchased by the consumer from the retailer at retail.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The consumer has paid for the tobacco product in full before the shipment and delivery of the tobacco product to the consumer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The retailer or other person making the delivery has in its possession, at all times during which the tobacco product is being transported on a public highway, road, or street of this state, an invoice, receipt, or other documentation substantiating the sale to the consumer that states the name and address of the retailer, the name and address of the consumer, the delivery date, the trade name or brand of the tobacco product, the quantity, and the price paid for the tobacco product.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A retailer or person licensed under this act, other than a wholesaler or unclassified acquirer or a person acting as a transporter for a wholesaler or unclassified acquirer, shall not acquire for resale an individual package of cigarettes or a cigarette from an individual package unless that individual package of cigarettes has affixed to it a stamp as provided in this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A retailer or vending machine operator shall not sell or offer for sale an individual package of cigarettes to the general public that does not have affixed the stamp required by this act.

A secondary wholesaler, retailer, or vending machine operator may return cigarette packages bearing discontinued stamps to a wholesaler for credit. A wholesaler or unclassified acquirer may take credit on its tax returns for individual packages of cigarettes bearing discontinued stamps that are returned to the manufacturer for credit less the appropriate discount paid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Except as provided in subsection (11), a wholesaler or unclassified acquirer shall not give, sell, or lend any unaffixed stamps to another person and except as otherwise provided in this act, a person shall not accept, purchase, or borrow any unaffixed stamps from another person.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) For licensees who are stamping agents, reimbursement of qualified equipment costs actually incurred by the stamping agent, not otherwise compensated or reimbursed under subdivision (c) or (d), as determined by the department.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The department may require the payment of the tax imposed by this act upon the importation or acquisition of a tobacco product in or into this state.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An abatement or refund of the tax provided by this act may be made by the department for causes the department considers expedient. The department shall certify the amount and the state treasurer shall pay that amount out of the proceeds of the tax.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A person liable for the tax may reimburse itself by adding to the price of the tobacco products an amount equal to the tax levied under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A wholesaler, unclassified acquirer, or other person shall not sell or transfer any unaffixed stamps acquired by the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer from the department.

The department shall refund the value of the stamps, less the appropriate discount paid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer has unsalable packs returned from a retailer, secondary wholesaler, vending machine operator, wholesaler, or unclassified acquirer with stamps affixed, the department shall refund the amount of the tax less the appropriate discount paid. If the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer has unaffixed unsalable stamps, the department shall exchange with the wholesaler or unclassified acquirer new stamps in the same quantity as the unaffixed unsalable stamps. An application for refund of the tax must be filed on a form and in the manner prescribed by the department for that purpose, within 4 years from the date the stamps were originally acquired from the department. A wholesaler or unclassified acquirer shall make available for inspection by the department the unused or spoiled stamps and the stamps affixed to unsalable individual packages of cigarettes. The department may, at its own discretion, witness and certify the destruction of the unused or spoiled stamps and unsalable individual packages of cigarettes that are not returnable to the manufacturer. The wholesaler or unclassified acquirer shall provide certification from the manufacturer for any unsalable individual packages of cigarettes that are returned to the manufacturer.</div>

For purposes of the report described in this subsection, "unstamped cigarettes" means individual packages of cigarettes that do not bear a Michigan stamp. The department may provide the information contained in this report to a proper officer of another state, country, or province reciprocating in this privilege.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>205.427b Bad debt; deduction; definition.</B><P>Sec. 7b.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A licensee may deduct the amount of bad debts from the tax levied under section 7. The amount deducted must be charged off as uncollectible on the books of the licensee. If a person pays all or part of a bad debt with respect to which a licensee claimed a deduction under this section, the licensee is liable for the amount of taxes deducted in connection with that portion of the debt for which payment is received and shall remit these taxes in his or her next payment to the department under section 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Any claim for a bad debt deduction under this section must be supported by all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A copy of the original invoice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Evidence that the tobacco products described in the invoice were delivered to the person who ordered them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Evidence that the person who ordered and received the tobacco products did not pay the licensee for the tobacco products and that the licensee used reasonable collection practices in attempting to collect the debt.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) As used in this section, "bad debt" means the taxes attributable to any portion of a debt that is related to a sale of tobacco products subject to tax under section 7 that is not otherwise deductible or excludable, that has become worthless or uncollectible in the time period between the date when taxes accrue to the state for the licensee's preceding tax return and the date when taxes accrue to the state for the present return, and that is eligible to be claimed, or could be eligible to be claimed if the licensee kept accounts on an accrual basis, as a deduction pursuant to section 166 of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 166. A bad debt does not include any interest on the wholesale price of a tobacco product, uncollectible amounts on property that remains in the possession of the licensee until the full purchase price is paid, expenses incurred in attempting to collect any account receivable or any portion of the debt recovered, any accounts receivable that have been sold to a third party for collection, and repossessed property.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A tobacco product held, owned, possessed, transported, or in control of a person in violation of this act, and a vending machine, vehicle, and other tangible personal property containing a tobacco product in violation of this act and any related books and records are contraband and may be seized and confiscated by the department as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If an authorized inspector of the department or a police officer has reasonable cause to believe and does believe that a tobacco product is being acquired, possessed, transported, kept, sold, or offered for sale in violation of this act for which the penalty is a felony, the inspector or police officer may investigate or search the vehicle of transportation in which the tobacco product is believed to be located. If a tobacco product is found in a vehicle searched under this subsection or in a place of business inspected under this act, the tobacco product, vending machine, vehicle, other than a vehicle owned or operated by a transportation company otherwise transporting tobacco products in compliance with this act, or other tangible personal property containing those tobacco products and any books and records in possession of the person in control or possession of the tobacco product may be seized by the inspector or police officer and are subject to forfeiture as contraband as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) As soon as possible, but not more than 5 business days after seizure of any alleged contraband, the person making the seizure shall deliver personally or by registered mail to the last known address of the person from whom the seizure was made, if known, an inventory statement of the property seized. A copy of the inventory statement must also be filed with the state treasurer. The inventory statement must also contain a notice to the effect that unless demand for hearing as provided in this section is made within 10 business days, the designated property is forfeited to the state. If the person from whom the seizure was made is not known, the person making the seizure shall cause a copy of the inventory statement, together with the notice provided for in this subsection, to be published at least 3 times in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the seizure was made. Within 10 business days after the date of service of the inventory statement, or in the case of publication, within 10 business days after the date of last publication, the person from whom the property was seized or any person claiming an interest in the property may by registered mail, facsimile transmission, or personal service file with the state treasurer a demand for a hearing before the state treasurer or a person designated by the state treasurer for a determination as to whether the property was lawfully subject to seizure and forfeiture. The person shall verify a request for hearing filed by facsimile transmission by also providing a copy of the original request for hearing by registered mail or personal service. The person or persons are entitled to appear before the department, to be represented by counsel, and to present testimony and argument. Upon receipt of a request for hearing, the department shall hold the hearing within 15 business days. The hearing is not a contested case proceeding and is not subject to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328. After the hearing, the department shall render its decision in writing within 10 business days of the hearing and, by order, shall either declare the seized property subject to seizure and forfeiture, or declare the property returnable in whole or in part to the person entitled to possession. If, within 10 business days after the date of service of the inventory statement, the person from whom the property was seized or any person claiming an interest in the property does not file with the state treasurer a demand for a hearing before the department, the property seized is considered forfeited to the state by operation of law and may be disposed of by the department as provided in this section. If, after a hearing before the state treasurer or person designated by the state treasurer, the department determines that the property is lawfully subject to seizure and forfeiture and the person from whom the property was seized or any persons claiming an interest in the property do not take an appeal to the circuit court of the county in which the seizure was made within the time prescribed in this section, the property seized shall be considered forfeited to the state by operation of law and may be disposed of by the department as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a person is aggrieved by the decision of the department, that person may appeal to the circuit court of the county where the seizure was made to obtain a judicial determination of the lawfulness of the seizure and forfeiture. The action must be commenced within 20 days after notice of the department's determination is sent to the person or persons claiming an interest in the seized property. The court shall hear the action and determine the issues of fact and law involved in accordance with rules of practice and procedure as in other in rem proceedings. If a judicial determination of the lawfulness of the seizure and forfeiture cannot be made before deterioration of any of the property seized, the court shall order the destruction or sale of the property with public notice as determined by the court and require the proceeds to be deposited with the court until the lawfulness of the seizure and forfeiture is finally adjudicated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The department shall destroy all cigarettes forfeited to this state. The department may sell all tobacco products, except cigarettes, and other property forfeited pursuant to this section at public sale. Public notice of the sale must be given at least 5 days before the day of sale. The department may pay an amount not to exceed 25% of the proceeds of the sale to the local governmental unit whose law enforcement agency performed the seizure. The balance of the proceeds derived from the sale by the department must be credited to the general fund of the state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The seizure and destruction or sale of a tobacco product or other property under this section does not relieve a person from a fine, imprisonment, or other penalty for violation of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A person who is not an employee or officer of this state or a political subdivision of this state who furnishes to the department or to any law enforcement agency original information concerning a violation of this act, which information results in the collection and recovery of any tax or penalty or leads to the forfeiture of any cigarettes, or other property, may be awarded and paid by the state treasurer, compensation of not more than 10% of the net amount received from the sale of any forfeited cigarettes or other property, but not to exceed $5,000.00 which must be paid out of the receipts from the sale of the property. If any amount is issued to the local governmental unit under subsection (5), the amount awarded under this subsection to a person who provides original information that results in a seizure of cigarettes or other property by a local law enforcement agency must be paid from that amount issued under subsection (5). If in the opinion of the attorney general and the director of the department of state police it is considered necessary to preserve the identity of the person furnishing the information, the attorney general and the director of the department of state police shall file with the state treasurer an affidavit setting forth that necessity and a warrant may be issued jointly to the attorney general and the director of the department of state police. Upon payment to the person furnishing that information, the attorney general and the director of the department of state police shall file with the state treasurer an affidavit that the money has been by them paid to the person entitled to the money under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a retailer possesses or sells cigarettes on which the tax imposed under this act has not been paid or accrued to a wholesaler, secondary wholesaler, or unclassified acquirer licensed under this act, the retailer shall be prohibited from purchasing, possessing, or selling any cigarettes or other tobacco products as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For a first violation, for a period of not more than 6 months.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For a second violation within a period of 5 years, for a period of at least 6 months and not more than 36 months.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For a third or subsequent violation within a period of 5 years, for a period of at least 1 year and not more than 5 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The prohibition described in subsection (8) is effective upon service by certified mail or personal service on the retailer of notice issued by the department ordering the retailer to cease all sales and purchases of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Upon receipt of this notice, the retailer may return any tobacco products in the possession of the retailer upon which the tax imposed by this act has been paid or accrued to a wholesaler, secondary wholesaler, or unclassified acquirer licensed under this act. The department shall notify all licensed wholesalers, manufacturers, secondary wholesalers, vending machine operators, and unclassified acquirers of any retailer who has been prohibited from purchasing cigarettes or other tobacco products and the duration of the prohibition. A wholesaler, secondary wholesaler, or unclassified acquirer shall not sell cigarettes or other tobacco products to a retailer after receipt of notice from the department that the retailer is prohibited from purchasing tobacco products. Any cigarettes or other tobacco products found on the premises of the retailer during the period of prohibition are considered contraband and subject to seizure under this section, and constitute an additional improper possession under this subsection. The retailer may contest the order prohibiting purchase, possession, or sale of tobacco products in accordance with the appeal procedures and time limits provided in subsection (3) of this section. After completion of the appeals provided or upon expiration of the period to request such appeal, the department shall issue a final order and make service upon the retailer of an order to cease all purchases, possession, and sale of all cigarettes and other tobacco products for a specified period as appropriate. This order does not relieve the retailer from seizure and sale of a tobacco product or other property under this section, or relieve the retailer from a fine, imprisonment, or other penalty for violation of this act.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Where only this state and 1 other state are involved, the commissioner of revenue of this state and the taxing official of the other state shall each appoint a member of a board of arbitration, and these members shall appoint the third member of the board.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   The determination of such board and the record of its proceeding shall be filed with the authority having jurisdiction to assess the death tax in the state determined to be the domicile of the decedent and with the authorities which would have had jurisdiction to assess the death tax in each of the other states involved if the decedent had been found to be domiciled therein.</DIV>

Upon the filing of this agreement with the authority which would have jurisdiction to assess the death tax of this state, if the decedent died domiciled in this state, an assessment shall be made as provided in such agreement, and this assessment finally and conclusively fixes the amount of death tax due this state. If the aggregate amount payable under such agreement or under an agreement made in accordance with the provisions of section 3 to the states involved is less than the minimum credit allowable to the estate against the United States estate tax imposed with respect thereto, the executor forthwith shall also pay to the commissioner of taxation of this state the same percentage of the difference between such aggregate amount of such credit as the amount payable to such commissioner under such agreement bears to such aggregate amount.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The provisions of this section apply to a proceeding before the tribunal that is commenced before January 1, 2007.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A proceeding before the tribunal is original and independent and is considered de novo. For an assessment dispute as to the valuation of property or if an exemption is claimed, the assessment must be protested before the board of review before the tribunal acquires jurisdiction of the dispute under subsection (3), except as otherwise provided in this section for a year in which the July or December board of review has authority to determine a claim of exemption for qualified agricultural property or for an appeal of a denial of a principal residence exemption by the department of treasury, and in section 37(5) and (7). For a dispute regarding a determination of a claim for exemption of qualified agricultural property for a year in which the July or December board of review has authority to determine a claim of exemption for qualified agricultural property, the claim for exemption must be presented to either the July or December board of review before the tribunal acquires jurisdiction of the dispute. For a special assessment dispute, the special assessment must be protested at the hearing held for the purpose of confirming the special assessment roll before the tribunal acquires jurisdiction of the dispute.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The jurisdiction of the tribunal in an assessment dispute is invoked by a party in interest, as petitioner, filing a written petition on or before June 30 of the tax year involved. Except in the residential property and small claims division, a written petition is considered filed by June 30 of the tax year involved if it is sent by certified mail on or before June 30 of that tax year. In the residential property and small claims division, a written petition is considered filed by June 30 of the tax year involved if it is postmarked by first-class mail or delivered in person on or before June 30 of the tax year involved. All petitions required to be filed or served by a day during which the offices of the tribunal are not open for business shall be filed by the next business day. In all other matters, the jurisdiction of the tribunal is invoked by a party in interest, as petitioner, filing a written petition within 35 days after the final decision, ruling, determination, or order that the petitioner seeks to review. Except in the residential property and small claims division, a written petition is considered filed if it is sent by certified mail or delivered in person on or before expiration of the period in which an appeal may be made as provided by law. In the residential property and small claims division, a written petition is considered filed if it is postmarked by first-class mail or delivered in person on or before expiration of the period in which an appeal may be made as provided by law. An appeal of a contested tax bill shall be made within 60 days after mailing by the assessment district treasurer and the appeal is limited solely to correcting arithmetic errors or mistakes and is not a basis of appeal as to disputes of valuation of the property, the property's exempt status, or the property's equalized value resulting from equalization of its assessment by the county board of commissioners or the state tax commission. Service of the petition on the respondent shall be by certified mail. For an assessment dispute, service of the petition shall be mailed to the assessor of that governmental unit if the respondent is the local governmental unit. Except for petitions filed under chapter 6, a copy of the petition shall also be sent to the secretary of the school board in the local school district in which the property is located and to the clerk of any county that may be affected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The petition or answer may be amended at any time by leave of the tribunal and in compliance with its rules. If a tax was paid while the determination of the right to the tax is pending before the tribunal, the taxpayer may amend his or her petition to seek a refund of that tax.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A person or legal entity may appear before the tribunal in his or her own behalf or may be represented by an attorney or by any other person.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Tribunal, upon written request of a party to a proceeding, shall issue subpoenas forthwith requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence including but not limited to books, records, correspondence, and documents in their possession or under their control. On written request, the tribunal shall revoke a subpoena if the evidence, the production of which is required, does not relate to a matter in issue, or if the subpoena does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence, the production of which is required, or if for any other reason sufficient in law the subpoena is invalid. In case of refusal to comply with a subpoena, the party on whose behalf it was issued may file a petition, in the circuit court for Ingham county or for the county in which the proceeding is held, for an order requiring compliance.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The tribunal shall determine a property's taxable value pursuant to section 27a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.27a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The tribunal shall determine a property's state equalized valuation by multiplying its finding of true cash value by a percentage equal to the ratio of the average level of assessment in relation to true cash values in the assessment district, and equalizing that product by application of the equalization factor that is uniformly applicable in the assessment district for the year in question. The property's state equalized valuation shall not exceed 50% of the true cash value of the property on the assessment date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The petitioner has the burden of proof in establishing the true cash value of the property. The assessing agency has the burden of proof in establishing the ratio of the average level of assessments in relation to true cash values in the assessment district and the equalization factor that was uniformly applied in the assessment district for the year in question.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the taxpayer paid additional taxes as a result of the unlawful assessments on the same property after filing the petition, or if in subsequent years an unlawful assessment is made against the same property, the taxpayer, not later than the filing deadline prescribed in section 35 for a proceeding before the tribunal that is commenced before January 1, 2007 or section 35a for a proceeding before the tribunal that is commenced after December 31, 2006, except as otherwise provided in subsections (5) and (7), may amend the petition to join all of the claims for a determination of the property's taxable value, state equalized valuation, or exempt status and for a refund of payments based on the unlawful assessments. The motion to amend the petition to add a subsequent year shall be accompanied by a motion fee equal to 50% of the filing fee to file a petition to commence an appeal for that property in that year. A sum determined by the tribunal to have been unlawfully paid or underpaid shall bear interest from the date of payment to the date of judgment and the judgment shall bear interest to date of its payment. However, a sum determined by the tribunal to have been underpaid shall not bear interest for any time period prior to 28 days after the tribunal's decision. Interest required by this subsection shall accrue for periods before April 1, 1982 at a rate of 6% per year, shall accrue for periods after March 31, 1982 but before April 1, 1985 at a rate of 12% per year, and shall accrue for periods after March 31, 1985 but before April 1, 1994 at a rate of 9% per year. After March 31, 1994 but before January 1, 1996, interest shall accrue at an interest rate set monthly at a per annum rate based on the auction rate of the 91-day discount treasury bill rate for the first Monday in each month, plus 1%. After December 31, 1995 but before July 1, 2012, interest shall accrue at an interest rate set each year based on the average auction rate of 91-day discount treasury bills in the immediately preceding state fiscal year as certified by the department of treasury, plus 1%. The department of treasury shall certify the interest rate within 60 days after the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year. After June 30, 2012, interest shall accrue at 1 percentage point above the adjusted prime rate. As used in this section, "adjusted prime rate" means the average predominant prime rate quoted by not fewer than 3 commercial banks to large businesses, as determined by the department of treasury. The adjusted prime rate is to be based on the average prime rate charged by not fewer than 3 commercial banks during the 6-month period ending on March 31 and the 6-month period ending on September 30. One percentage point shall be added to the adjusted prime rate and the resulting sum shall be divided by 12 to establish the current monthly interest rate. The resulting current monthly interest rate based on the 6-month period ending March 31 becomes effective on the following July 1, and the resulting current monthly interest rate based on the 6-month period ending September 30 becomes effective on January 1 of the following year. The tribunal shall order the refund of all or part of a property tax administration fee paid in connection with taxes that the tribunal determines were unlawfully paid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A motion to amend a petition to add subsequent years is not necessary in the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the tribunal has jurisdiction over a petition alleging that the property is exempt from taxation, the appeal for each subsequent year for which an assessment has been established shall be added automatically to the petition. However, upon leave of the tribunal, the petitioner or respondent may request that any subsequent year be excluded from appeal at the time of the hearing on the petition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the residential property and small claims division of the tribunal has jurisdiction over a petition, the appeal for each subsequent year for which an assessment has been established shall be added automatically to the petition. The residential property and small claims division shall automatically add to an appeal of a final determination of a claim for exemption of a principal residence or of qualified agricultural property each subsequent year in which a claim for exemption of that principal residence or that qualified agricultural property is denied. However, upon leave of the tribunal, the petitioner or respondent may request that any subsequent year be excluded from appeal at the time of the hearing on the petition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The notice of the hearing on a petition shall include a statement advising the petitioner of the right to amend his or her petition to include or exclude subsequent years as provided by subsections (4) and (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the final equalization multiplier for the tax year is greater than the tentative multiplier used in preparing the assessment notice and as a result of action of the state board of equalization or county board of commissioners a taxpayer's assessment as equalized is in excess of 50% of true cash value, that person may appeal directly to the tax tribunal without a prior protest before the local board of review. The appeal shall be filed under this subsection on or before the third Monday in August and shall be heard in the same manner as other appeals of the tribunal. An appeal pursuant to this subsection shall not result in an equalized value less than the assessed value multiplied by the tentative equalization multiplier used in preparing the assessment notice.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The residential property and small claims division created in section 61 has jurisdiction over a proceeding, otherwise cognizable by the tribunal, in which residential property is exclusively involved. Property other than residential property may be included in a proceeding before the residential property and small claims division if the amount of that property's taxable value or state equalized valuation in dispute is not more than $100,000.00. The residential property and small claims division also has jurisdiction over a proceeding involving an appeal of any other tax over which the tribunal has jurisdiction if the amount of the tax in dispute is $20,000.00 or less, adjusted annually by the inflation rate. As used in this subsection, "inflation rate" means the ratio of the general price level for the state fiscal year ending in the calendar year immediately preceding the current year divided by the general price level for the state fiscal year ending in the calendar year before the year immediately preceding the current year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A person or legal entity entitled to proceed under section 31, and whose proceeding meets the jurisdictional requirements of subsection (1), may elect to proceed before either the residential property and small claims division or the entire tribunal. A formal record of residential property and small claims division proceedings is not required. Within 20 days after a hearing officer or referee issues a proposed order, a party may file exceptions to the proposed order. The tribunal shall review the exceptions to determine if the proposed order shall be adopted as a final order. Upon a showing of good cause or at the tribunal's discretion, the tribunal may modify the proposed order and issue a final order or hold a rehearing by a tribunal member. A rehearing is not limited to the evidence presented before the hearing officer or referee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the residential property and small claims division shall meet in the county in which the property in question is located or in a county contiguous to the county in which the property in question is located. A petitioner-appellant shall not be required to travel more than 100 miles from the location of the property in question to the hearing site, except that a rehearing by a tribunal member shall be at a site determined by the tribunal. By leave of the tribunal and with the mutual consent of all parties, a residential property and small claims division proceeding may take place at a location mutually agreed upon by all parties or may take place by the use of amplified telephonic or video conferencing equipment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The tribunal shall make a short form for the simplified filing of residential property and small claims appeals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) In a proceeding before the residential property and small claims division for property other than residential property, if the amount of taxable value or state equalized valuation in dispute is greater than $20,000.00, or in nonproperty matters if the amount in dispute is greater than $1,000.00, the filing fee is the amount that would have been paid if the proceeding was brought before the entire tribunal and not the residential property and small claims division.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) As used in this chapter, "residential property" means any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Real property exempt under section 7cc of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7cc.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Real property classified as residential real property under section 34c of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.34c.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Real property with less than 4 rental units.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Real property classified as agricultural real property under section 34c of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.34c.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A petitioner shall submit a written request for an informal settlement conference to the local tax collecting unit and shall file a copy of that written request with the residential property and small claims division. A local tax collecting unit shall submit a written request for an informal settlement conference to the petitioner and shall file a copy of that written request with the residential property and small claims division. A written request shall include a statement attesting to the service of the written request on the petitioner or local tax collecting unit, as appropriate. The statement shall identify the person upon whom the request was served and the date and method by which the written request was served on that person.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a petitioner has requested an informal settlement conference under subsection (2), the local tax collecting unit shall schedule and hold an informal settlement conference within 60 days after receipt of the written request. The informal settlement conference shall be held telephonically or at the offices of the local tax collecting unit. If the local tax collecting unit does not schedule and hold an informal settlement conference within 60 days after receipt of the written request, the petitioner may file a motion with the residential property and small claims division for an order to compel the informal settlement conference. If the residential and small claims division issues an order compelling an informal settlement conference, the local tax collecting unit shall conduct an informal settlement conference as required by the order. If the local tax collecting unit does not schedule and hold an informal settlement conference as required by the order to compel the informal settlement conference, the residential property and small claims division shall schedule an expedited default hearing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a local tax collecting unit has requested an informal settlement conference under subsection (2), the local tax collecting unit shall schedule and hold an informal settlement conference within 60 days after delivery of the written request to the petitioner.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) At the informal settlement conference, the petitioner and the local tax collecting unit may enter into a stipulation for judgment. The stipulation for judgment shall be filed with the residential property and small claims division.

Upon a showing of good cause or at the residential property and small claims division's discretion, the residential property and small claims division may reject the proposed stipulation for judgment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the petitioner and the local tax collecting unit do not agree to a stipulation for judgment or if the residential property and small claims division rejects the proposed stipulation for judgment, the petitioner's appeal shall continue as provided in this act.</div>

No. 5138 (1976) states, in part: “I am, therefore, of the opinion that the legislation did not intend to abolish the State Board of Tax Appeals unless its jurisdiction was effectively transferred to another administrative or quasi-judicial body. Consequently, I conclude that 1973 PA 186, section 79, as originally enacted and as amended by 1976 PA 37 is invalid in its entirety and that it does not abolish the State Board of Tax Appeals.”</p>

Relief from liability under this section does not apply if a certified service provider or a seller that uses a certified automated system has incorrectly classified an item or transaction into a product category of the certified automated system.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 29.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A seller registered under the agreement is not liable for any uncollected or nonremitted sales or use tax on transactions with purchasers in this state before the date of registration if the seller was not licensed or registered under the general sales tax act or the use tax act in this state in the 12-month period preceding the effective date of this state's participation in the agreement. The seller is also not responsible for any penalty or interest that may be due on those transactions. This subsection applies only if the seller is registered in this state within 12 months of the effective date of this state's participation in the agreement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Subsection (1) does not apply to the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Any tax liability of the registered seller for transactions that are subject to sales or use tax in this state in which the registered seller is the purchaser.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Any sales or use taxes already paid or remitted to this state or to taxes collected by the seller.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Any transactions for which the seller received notice of the commencement of an audit and the audit is not finally resolved, including related administrative or judicial processes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Subsection (1) applies to the seller absent the seller's fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact only if the seller continues to be registered under the agreement and continues collection and remittance of applicable sales and use taxes in this state for at least 36 months. The statute of limitations applicable to assessing a tax liability is tolled during this 36-month period.</DIV>
