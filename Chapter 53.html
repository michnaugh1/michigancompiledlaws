<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The board of supervisors of each county shall, from time to time, provide suitable books, at the expense of the county, for the entering and recording of all deeds and matters required by law to be entered and recorded by the register of deeds.

Such record may be made wholly or partly with a typewriter if ink of a permanent character is used therewith. When the number of leaves in any binder shall constitute a book of a proper and convenient size they shall be permanently bound in some manner, but may be retained in the original binder or placed in a transfer binder if the mechanism thereof permits of so securing such leaves therein that they cannot be removed therefrom with or without a key.</DIV>
