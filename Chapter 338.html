<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A licensing board or agency may only consider judgments in civil actions entered against an individual as evidence of his or her lack of good moral character if more than 1 judgment in a civil action has been entered against him or her.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A licensing board or agency shall not consider an individual's criminal conviction, in and of itself, as conclusive proof of his or her lack of good moral character. Except as provided in subsection (3), a licensing board or agency may only consider an individual's criminal conviction as evidence in the determination of his or her good moral character if the licensing board or agency finds that the individual's criminal record includes a conviction for a felony and any of the following apply to that felony:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The licensing board or agency concludes that the specific offense for which the individual was convicted has a direct and specific relationship to the activities authorized by the occupational or professional license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The specific offense for which the individual was convicted involves a demonstrable risk to the public safety.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The individual, based on the nature of the offense for which he or she was convicted and on any additional information provided by the licensee under subsection (4), is more likely to commit a subsequent offense because he or she has the occupational or professional license than if he or she does not have the occupational or professional license. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A subsequent offense committed with the aid of the occupational or professional license will cause greater harm to the public than it would if the individual did not have the occupational or professional license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A licensing board or agency shall not consider an individual's criminal conviction, in and of itself, as conclusive proof of his or her lack of good moral character, but may use an individual's criminal conviction as evidence in the determination of his or her good moral character without meeting the requirements of subsection (2) if the licensing board or agency is 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A principal department, or a board or agency within a principal department, to the extent that department, board, or agency is responsible for the licensing and regulation of any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Child care organizations under 1973 PA 116, MCL 722.111 to 722.128.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Homes for the aged or nursing homes under the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.1101 to 333.25211.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Adult foster care facilities under the adult foster care facility licensing act, 1979 PA 218, MCL 400.701 to 400.737.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The Michigan commission on law enforcement standards created in section 3 of the Michigan commission on law enforcement standards act, 1965 PA 203, MCL 28.603.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The board of law examiners created in section 922 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.922.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A licensing board or agency shall also consider an individual's certificate of employability, if any, under section 34d of the corrections code of 1953, 1953 PA 232, MCL 791.234d,  and any additional information about his or her current circumstances, such as how long ago the offense occurred, whether he or she completed the sentence for the offense, other evidence of rehabilitation, testimonials, employment history, and employment aspirations as evidence in the determination of an individual's good moral character under subsection (2) or (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a judgment in a civil action is used under subsection (1) or a criminal conviction is used under subsection (2) or (3) as evidence of an individual's lack of good moral character, the licensing board or agency shall notify the individual and he or she is permitted to rebut the evidence by showing that at the current time he or she has the ability to, and is likely to, serve the public in a fair, honest, and open manner, that he or she is rehabilitated, or that the criteria under subsection (1), (2), or (3) have not been met.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 9.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The department, when satisfied of the competency and integrity of the applicant, or if the applicant is a firm, partnership, company, limited liability company, or corporation, of its individual members or officers, shall issue to the applicant a license upon the applicant's paying to the department an application processing fee of $150.00 and an initial license fee of $600.00. The applicant shall execute, deliver, and file with the department a bond in the sum of $10,000.00, conditioned for the faithful and honest conduct of the business by the applicant, which bond shall be approved by the department. The license is valid for 3 years but is subject to suspension or revocation at all times by the department for cause shown. The bonds shall be taken in the name of the people of the state, and any person injured by the willful, malicious, and wrongful act of the principal may bring an action on the bond or insurance in his or her own name to recover damages suffered by reason of such willful, malicious, and wrongful act. In lieu of a bond, the applicant may furnish a policy of insurance issued by an insurer authorized to do business in this state naming the licensee and the state as co-insured in the amount of $10,000.00 for property damages, $100,000.00 for injury or death of 1 person, and $200,000.00 for injuries to or deaths of more than 1 person arising out of the operation of the licensed activity. The license shall be in a form to be prescribed by the department and shall specify the full name of the applicant, the location of the principal office or place of business and the location of the bureau, agency, subagency, office or branch office for which the license is issued, the expiration date, and the name of the person filing the statement required by this act upon which the license is issued.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A licensee desiring to open a branch office or subagency shall receive a license for that branch or subagency upon payment to the department of an additional fee of $125.00 for each additional license. The additional license shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the branch office or subagency and expires on the date of the initial license.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the license is suspended or revoked for any cause, the department shall not refund the license or application processing fee or any part of the license or application processing fee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Beginning the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection, the department shall issue an initial or renewal license not later than 90 days after the applicant files a completed application. Receipt of the application is considered the date the application is received by any agency or department of the state of Michigan. If the application is considered incomplete by the department, the department shall notify the applicant in writing, or make information electronically available, within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The 90-day period is tolled upon notification by the department of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the department. The determination of the completeness of an application does not operate as an approval of the application for the license and does not confer eligibility of an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the department fails to issue or deny a license within the time required by this section, the department shall return the license fee and shall reduce the license fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. The failure to issue a license within the time required under this section does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and that application, upon completion, shall be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based upon the fact that the license fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Beginning October 1, 2005, the director of the department shall submit a report by December 1 of each year to the standing committees and appropriations subcommittees of the senate and house of representatives concerned with occupational issues. The director shall include all of the following information in the report concerning the preceding fiscal year:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The number of initial and renewal applications the department received and completed within the 90-day time period described in subsection (4).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The number of applications denied.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The number of applicants not issued a license within the 90-day time period and the amount of money returned to licensees and registrants under subsection (5).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   As used in this section and section 26, "completed application" means an application complete on its face and submitted with any applicable licensing fees as well as any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of the state of Michigan.</DIV>

Grand Rapids v Impens, 414 Mich 667; 327 NW2d 278 (1982).Participation by an off-duty deputy sheriff from another county, employed as a private guard, with other guards in the apprehension and detention of a shoplifting suspect did not provide a sufficient relationship so as to bring the activities of the guards under color of state law and require warnings of the suspect's constitutional rights before eliciting inculpatory statements by the suspect where the deputy did not obtain the statements and identified himself to the suspect only as a store employee.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The department shall issue a license to an applicant when the requirements of this act are met and the department is satisfied of the good character, competence, and integrity of the applicant, if the applicant is an individual, or if the applicant is an entity other than a private college or university, of its individual members or officers, or, if the applicant is a private college or university, of its governing board. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A license issued under this act is valid for 2 years, but the department may revoke a license at any time for good cause shown. The department shall prescribe the form of a license certificate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The department shall not issue a license under this act unless the applicant pays the department a fee of $500.00 if the applicant is a security alarm system contractor, or for any other applicant, 1 of the following fees, as appropriate:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the applicant is an individual or sole proprietorship, $200.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the applicant is an entity, $300.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The department shall not issue a license under this act unless the applicant provides the department a bond in the principal amount of $25,000.00. The bond shall be conditioned on the faithful and honest conduct of the business by the applicant and approved by the department. In lieu of a bond, an applicant may furnish a policy of insurance issued by an insurer authorized to do business in this state that names the licensee and the state as coinsureds in the amount of $25,000.00 for property damages, $100,000.00 for injury to or death of 1 person, and $200,000.00 for injuries to or deaths of more than 1 person arising out of the operation of the licensed activity. The bond shall be payable for the benefit of the people of the state and a person injured by the willful, malicious, and wrongful act of the licensee or any agents or employees of a licensee may bring an action on the bond or insurance policy in his or her own name to recover damages suffered by reason of the wrongful act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a licensee intends to open 1 or more branch offices, the licensees may receive a license for each branch if the branch license is approved under section 7 and the licensee pays the department an additional fee of $50.00 for each private security guard branch office license and $100.00 for each security alarm system contractor branch office license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A licensee shall post an additional license issued under subsection (5) in a conspicuous place in the branch office, and each additional license expires on the same date as the initial license. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Subject to subsection (8), if a license is denied, revoked, or suspended for cause, the department shall not refund the license fees or any part of the license fees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Beginning July 23, 2004, the department shall issue or deny an application for an initial or renewal license within 180 days after the applicant files a completed application. An application is considered received on the date the application is received by any agency or department of this state. If an application is considered incomplete by the department, the department shall notify the applicant in writing, or make the information electronically available, within 30 days after the department receives the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. A 180-day period described in this subsection is tolled from the date the department notifies the applicant of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the department. The determination of the completeness of an application does not operate as an approval of the application for the license and does not confer eligibility of an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the department fails to issue or deny a license in the time required under this section, the department shall return the license fee and shall reduce the license fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. The failure to issue a license in the time required under this section does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of an application, and on completion, the department shall place the application in sequence with any other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in processing an application based on the fact that the license fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Beginning October 1, 2005, the director of the department shall submit a report by December 1 of each year to the standing committees and appropriations subcommittees of the senate and house of representatives concerned with occupational issues. The director shall include all of the following information in the report concerning the preceding fiscal year:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The number of initial and renewal applications the department received and completed within the 180-day time period described in subsection (8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The number of applications denied.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The number of applicants not issued a license within the 180-day time period and the amount of money returned to licensees and registrants under subsection (8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The fees collected by the department under this section shall be deposited into the security business fund created in subsection (12).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The security business fund is created in the state treasury. The department shall deposit all license fees collected under this act into the fund. The state treasurer may receive money or other assets from any source for deposit into the fund. The state treasurer shall direct the investment of the fund. The state treasurer shall credit to the fund interest and earnings from fund investments. Money in the fund at the close of the fiscal year shall remain in the fund and be available for appropriation and expenditure by the department in subsequent fiscal years. The money in the fund shall not lapse to the general fund. The department shall expend money from the fund, on appropriation, only for enforcement and administration of this act. The department is the administrator of the fund for auditing purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The department, or the department of state police if section 29 applies, shall waive an initial license fee required under this section, or any application processing fee charged by the department for an initial license, if the applicant is an individual who served in the armed forces and he or she provides to the department a form DD214, form DD215, or any other form that is satisfactory to the department that demonstrates he or she was separated from that service with an honorable character of service or under honorable conditions (general) character of service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) As used in this section, "completed application" means an application that is complete on its face and submitted with any applicable licensing fees and any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private person but not from another department or agency of this state.</div>

The application, qualification, and enforcement provisions under this act apply to private security police and private college security forces except that the administration of those provisions shall be performed by, and the payment of the appropriate fees shall be paid to, the department of state police. The director of the department may jointly promulgate rules with the department of state police under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, to facilitate the bifurcation of authority described in this subsection.</div>

However, any person, firm, limited liability company, business organization, educational institution, or corporation maintaining a private security police organization or a private college security force may voluntarily apply for licensure under this act. When a private security police employer or private college security force employer as described in this section provides the employee with a pistol for the purpose of protecting the property of the employer, the pistol shall be considered the property of the employer and the employer shall retain custody of the pistol, except during the actual working hours of the employee.

Grand Rapids v Impens, 414 Mich 667; 327 NW2d 278 (1982).Participation by an off-duty deputy sheriff from another county, employed as a private guard, with other guards in the apprehension and detention of a shoplifting suspect did not provide a sufficient relationship so as to bring the activities of the guards under color of state law and require warnings of the suspect's constitutional rights before eliciting inculpatory statements by the suspect where the deputy did not obtain the statements and identified himself to the suspect only as a store employee.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Beginning the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection, the department shall issue an initial or renewal license not later than 90 days after the applicant files a completed application. Receipt of the application is considered the date the application is received by any agency or department of the state of Michigan. If the application is considered incomplete by the department, the department shall notify the applicant in writing, or make the information available electronically, within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The 90-day period is tolled upon notification by the department of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the department. The determination of the completeness of an application does not operate as an approval of the application for the license and does not confer eligibility of an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license.</DIV>

The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based upon the fact that the license fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Beginning October 1, 2005, the director of the department shall submit a report by December 1 of each year to the standing committees and appropriations subcommittees of the senate and house of representatives concerned with occupational issues.

</P>
<P>Sec. 211.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Within 15 working days after receiving a license application, the department shall acknowledge receipt of the application and notify the applicant in writing, or make the information electronically available, of any deficiency in the application. Receipt of the application is considered the date the application is received by any agency or department of the state of Michigan. Within 60 calendar days after receiving a completed application, including all additional information requested by the department, the department shall issue a license or deny the license application. The 60-day time period is tolled upon notification by the department of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the department. The determination of the completeness of an application does not operate as an approval of the application for the license and does not confer eligibility of an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license. The license shall contain a statement in bold print that the issuance of a license does not imply asbestos indemnification coverage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The department shall deny a license application if the department determines that the applicant has not demonstrated the ability to comply with either of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The applicable requirements and procedures established by the department and the board under this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Other state and federal law pertaining to the health and safety aspects of asbestos demolition, renovation, and encapsulation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Beginning the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection and notwithstanding any other provision of this act, if the department fails to issue or deny a license within the time required by this section, the department shall return the license fee and shall reduce the license fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. The failure to issue a license within the time required under this section does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and that application, upon completion, shall be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based upon the fact that the license fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Beginning October 1, 2005, the director of the department shall submit a report by December 1 of each year to the standing committees and appropriations subcommittees of the senate and house of representatives concerned with asbestos and regulatory issues. The director shall include all of the following information in the report concerning the preceding fiscal year:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The number of initial and renewal applications the department received and completed within the time period described in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The number of applications denied.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The number of applicants not issued a license within the 60-day time period and the amount of money returned to licensees under subsection (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the department denies a license, the department shall return to the applicant the application fee, less $25.00 subject to subsection (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Proceedings for the denial of a license under this act shall be in accordance with the administrative procedures act of 1969.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   As used in this section and section 209, "completed application" means an application complete on its face and submitted with any applicable licensing fees as well as any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of the state of Michigan.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Beginning the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection, the department shall issue an initial or renewal license within the time period prescribed by subsection (4).

The 60-day period described in subsection (4) is tolled upon notification by the department of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the department. The determination of the completeness of an application does not operate as an approval of the application for the license and does not confer eligibility of an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If the department fails to issue or deny a license within the time required by subsection (4), the department shall return the license fee and shall reduce the license fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. The failure to issue a license within the time required under this section does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and that application, upon completion, shall be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based upon the fact that the license fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Beginning October 1, 2005, the director of the department shall submit a report by December 1 of each year to the standing committees and appropriations subcommittees of the senate and house of representatives concerned with occupational issues.
