<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   A statement that the real estate has not previously been used or accepted as bail in this state during the 12 months preceding the date of the bail bond.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   A statement that the real estate is security for the appearance of the accused in accordance with the conditions of the bail bond.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The sworn schedule constitutes a material part of the bail bond. The affiant commits perjury if in the sworn schedule the affiant makes a false statement he or she does not believe to be true. The affiant shall be prosecuted and punished accordingly or may be punished for contempt.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A certified copy of the bail bond and schedule of real estate shall be filed immediately by the court in the office of the register of deeds of the county in which the real estate is situated. The state shall have a lien on the real estate from the time copies are filed in the office of the register of deeds. The register of deeds shall enter, index and record the bail bonds and schedules without requiring any advance fee. The fee shall be taxed as costs in the proceeding and paid out of the costs when collected.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   When the conditions of the bail bond have been performed and the accused has been discharged from his or her obligations in the cause, the clerk of the court shall return to the accused or his or her sureties the deposit of any cash, stocks, or bonds, except as provided in subsection (7). If the bail bond was secured by real estate, the clerk of the court shall promptly notify in writing the register of deeds and the lien of the bail bond on the real estate shall be discharged.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If the court ordered a defendant who has made a cash deposit according to subsection (1) to pay a fine, costs, restitution, assessment, or other payment, the court shall order the fine, costs, restitution, assessment, or other payment collected out of the cash deposit. If a person is subject to any combination of fines, costs, restitution, assessments, or payments arising out of the same criminal proceeding, money collected from that person for the payment of fines, costs, restitution, assessments, or other payments shall be allocated as provided in section 22 of chapter XV of the code of criminal procedure, Act No. 175 of the Public Acts of 1927, being section 775.22 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If the accused does not comply with the conditions of the bail bond, the court having jurisdiction shall enter an order declaring the bail to be forfeited. Notice of the order of forfeiture shall be mailed promptly by the clerk of the court to the accused and his or her sureties at their last known address. If the accused does not appear and surrender to the court having jurisdiction within 30 days from the date of the forfeiture, or within that period satisfy the court that appearance and surrender by the accused is impossible and without his or her fault, the court shall enter judgment for the state or local unit of government against the accused and his or her sureties for the amount of the bail and costs of the proceedings.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   When judgment is entered in favor of the state or local unit of government on any bail bond the attorney for the local unit of government, the prosecuting attorney or the attorney general shall have execution issued on the judgment promptly and shall deliver the execution to the sheriff to be executed by levy on the cash, stocks or bonds deposited with the clerk of the court or the real estate described in the bail bond schedule. The cash shall be used to satisfy the judgment and costs and shall be paid into the treasury of the unit of government in which the court is located. The stocks, bonds, or real estate shall be sold in the same manner as in execution sales in civil actions. The proceeds of the sale shall be used to satisfy all court costs and prior encumbrances, if any, and a sufficient amount to satisfy the judgment shall be paid into the treasury of the unit of government in which the court is located. The balance shall be returned to the owner. The real estate may be redeemed in the same manner as real estate may be redeemed after judicial or execution sales in civil actions.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   A stock, bond, or real estate shall not be used or accepted as bail bond security in this state more than once in any 12-month period.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The support amount determined by application of the child support formula.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   How the support order deviates from the child support formula.</DIV>

Upon receipt of these documents the clerk of the court, without payment of a filing fee or other cost to the obligee, shall file them in the registry of foreign support orders. The filing constitutes registration under this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Promptly upon registration of the foreign support order, the clerk of the court shall docket the case and shall notify the friend of the court of the registration of the foreign support order.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The attorney general is hereby authorized, subject to the approval of the controller of the department of administration, to enter into contracts with similar officials of any other state or states for the purpose of sharing an equitable portion of the cost of effecting the return of any person who has violated the terms and conditions of parole as imposed by this state. The contract shall covenant and agree as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;"1.   The party states hereby agree that any two or more of them may, in the discretion of their appropriate officials, cooperate in effecting the return of any parole violator.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;"2.   In any instance where any officer or officers of one or more of the parties hereto shall effect the return of a parole violator from any jurisdiction to the custody of the state directing his return, the state on whose behalf the return is made shall bear the financial burden of such return and the extent of the financial liability of the cooperating states shall be determined as provided in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of this contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;"3.   In every instance where a cooperative return of one or more parole violators is undertaken, the round trip distance which would have been traveled by the officers of each cooperating state in effecting the return of its own violators shall be computed and the sum of all such round trip distances shall also be computed. The share of the expense of a trip chargeable to any cooperating state shall be determined by ascertaining the proportion which its own round trip would have borne to the sum of all round trips which would have been necessary if all states had effected the return of their own violators by employing their own regular officers. Whenever the violator or violators of any cooperating state are not returned to the ultimate destination entirely by the regular officer or officers of another cooperating state or states, the state to which such violator or violators are to be returned shall be entitled to deduct the round trip distance between said ultimate destination and the point where it receives custody of its violator or violators from the round trip distance which its officer or officers would have traveled if such state had effected the entire return of such violator or violators. Standard highway or railway mileage shall be used in calculating distances pursuant to this paragraph.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;"4.   The entire cost of a cooperative trip, but not including any charge on account of the salary or wages of any officer employed on said trip, shall form the base for determining the share of the expense to be borne by each cooperating state. The cost of any mileage shall be at the official rate for vehicles prevailing in the state by which such vehicles are owned or leased.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;"5.(a)   Except where any injury or damage referred to herein results solely from the violent act or acts of its own violator or violators, no cooperating state shall be chargeable with any cost nor shall such state incur any liability by reason of injury to any officer regularly employed by another cooperating state nor shall any cooperating state be chargeable with or incur any liability by reason of damage to any vehicle or other equipment owned or leased by another cooperating state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Workmen's compensation benefits and payments shall be determined and made in accordance with the laws of the state regularly employing the officer.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a person is arrested without a warrant for a misdemeanor or a violation of a city, village, or township ordinance, and the misdemeanor or violation is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or by a fine, or both, the officer making the arrest shall take, without unnecessary delay, the person arrested before the most convenient magistrate of the county in which the offense was committed to answer to the complaint.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   For purposes of subsection (3), if the person is arrested in a political subdivision that has a holding cell, holding center, or lockup, the person shall be held in that holding cell, holding center, or lockup. However, if that holding facility is at capacity then the person may be held in a holding cell, holding center, or lockup willing to accept the prisoner.

Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of co-operative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such co-operative procedures.

The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner's written notice request, and the certificate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.</div>

The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of his body in any court where his presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.

Except for his attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place at which his presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Beginning on January 1, 2020, a person convicted of 1 or more misdemeanor marihuana offenses may apply to set aside the conviction or convictions under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An application under subsection (1) must contain all of the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The full name and current address of the applicant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A certified record of each conviction that is to be set aside.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A copy of the application under subsection (1) must be served upon the agency that prosecuted the offense or offenses the applicant seeks to set aside.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A rebuttable presumption that a conviction for a misdemeanor marihuana offense sought to be set aside by an applicant was based on activity that would not have been a crime if committed on or after December 6, 2018 arises upon the filing of an application under subsection (1). The presumption described in this subsection may be rebutted by the presentation of evidence by the prosecuting agency that prosecuted the case that demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the conduct on which the applicant's conviction was or convictions were based would constitute a criminal violation of the laws of this state or a political subdivision of this state if it had been committed on or after December 6, 2018. An answer made under this subsection must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of service of the application. If an answer is filed with the convicting court, the answering party must serve the answer upon the other parties to the matter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Upon the expiration of the 60-day period under subsection (4), if the prosecuting agency has not filed an answer to the application addressing the rebuttable presumption described in subsection (4), the convicting court must within 21 days enter an order setting aside the conviction or convictions and serve a copy of the order upon the applicant, the arresting agency, the prosecuting agency, and the department of the state police.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the prosecuting agency files an answer addressing the rebuttable presumption in subsection (4), the convicting court must promptly set the matter for a hearing no later than 30 days from its receipt of the answer, and serve a notice of the hearing upon the applicant. At the hearing, the prosecuting agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a conviction or convictions sought to be set aside by an applicant were based upon conduct that would constitute a criminal violation of the laws of this state or a political subdivision of this state if it had been committed on or after December 6, 2018. An applicant is not required to present evidence that his or her conviction was based upon conduct that would not constitute a criminal violation of the laws of this state or a political subdivision of this state on or after December 6, 2018. The evidentiary burden under this subsection rests solely on the objecting prosecuting agency. After a hearing under this subsection, the court shall enter an order denying or granting the application no later than 14 days after completion of the hearing and serve any written opinions and orders, including an order setting aside the conviction or convictions, upon the parties, including the department of state police. The rules of evidence do not apply to a hearing under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) As used in this section, "misdemeanor marihuana offense" means a violation of section 7403(2)(d), 7404(2)(d), or a marihuana paraphernalia violation of section 7453 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7403, 333.7404, and 333.7453, or a violation of a local ordinance substantially corresponding to section 7403(2)(d), 7404(2)(d), or the prohibition regarding marihuana paraphernalia of section 7453 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7403, 333.7404, and 333.7453. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If an application to set aside a conviction or convictions under section 1e is granted, the arresting agency and the department of the state police shall maintain the nonpublic record created under section 3 for use as authorized under section 3.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If an application to set aside a conviction or convictions is granted under section 1e, the applicant may not thereafter seek resentencing in another criminal case the applicant was sentenced for during which the conviction or convictions at issue were used in determining an appropriate sentence for the applicant, whether or not the setting aside of the conviction or convictions would have changed the scoring of a prior record variable for purposes of the sentencing guidelines or otherwise.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A party aggrieved by the ruling of the convicting court considering an application under section 1e may seek a rehearing or reconsideration under the applicable rules of the convicting court or may file an appeal with the circuit court or, if applicable, the court of appeals in accordance with the rules of those courts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The setting aside of a conviction under section 1e does not entitle the applicant to the return of any fines, costs, or fees imposed as part of the applicant's sentence for the conviction or convictions or of any money or property forfeited by the prosecuting agency or any law enforcement agency as a result of the conduct leading to the conviction or as a result of the conviction itself.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The victim has the right to appear and make an oral impact statement at the sentencing of the defendant. If the victim is physically or emotionally unable to make the oral impact statement, the victim may designate any other person 18 years of age or older who is neither the defendant nor incarcerated to make the statement on the victim's behalf. The other person need not be an attorney. The victim may elect to remotely provide the oral impact statement under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Unless the court has determined, in its discretion, that the defendant is behaving in a disruptive manner or presents a threat to the safety of any individuals present in the courtroom, the defendant must be physically present in the courtroom at the time a victim makes an oral impact statement under subsection (1). In making its determination under this subsection, the court may consider any relevant statement provided by the victim regarding the defendant being physically present during that victim's oral impact statement. This subsection applies to cases in which the sentencing of the defendant occurs after May 22, 2018.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) 2018 PA 153, which amended this section and sections 43 and 75, may be cited as the "Rebekah Bletsch law".</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as provided in subsection (8), when sentencing a defendant convicted of a crime, the court shall order, in addition to or in lieu of any other penalty authorized by law or in addition to any other penalty required by law, that the defendant make full restitution to any victim of the defendant's course of conduct that gives rise to the conviction or to the victim's estate. For an offense that is resolved by assignment of the defendant to youthful trainee status, by a delayed sentence or deferred judgment of guilt, or in another way that is not an acquittal or unconditional dismissal, the court shall order the restitution required under this section. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a crime results in damage to or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the crime or results in the seizure or impoundment of property of a victim of the crime, the order of restitution shall require that the defendant do 1 or more of the following, as applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Return the property to the owner of the property or to a person designated by the owner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If return of the property under subdivision (a) is impossible, impractical, or inadequate, pay an amount equal to the greater of subparagraph (i) or (ii), less the value, determined as of the date the property is returned, of that property or any part of the property that is returned:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The fair market value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction. However, if the fair market value of the property cannot be determined or is impractical to ascertain, then the replacement value of the property shall be utilized in lieu of the fair market value.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The fair market value of the property on the date of sentencing. However, if the fair market value of the property cannot be determined or is impractical to ascertain, then the replacement value of the property shall be utilized in lieu of the fair market value.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Pay the costs of the seizure or impoundment, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a crime results in physical or psychological injury to a victim, the order of restitution shall require that the defendant do 1 or more of the following, as applicable:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Pay an amount equal to the reasonably determined costs of homemaking and child care expenses actually incurred and reasonably expected to be incurred as a result of the crime or, if homemaking or child care is provided without compensation by a relative, friend, or any other person, an amount equal to the costs that would reasonably be incurred as a result of the crime for that homemaking and child care, based on the rates in the area for comparable services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Pay an amount equal to the cost of actual funeral and related services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) If the deceased victim could be claimed as a dependent by his or her parent or guardian on the parent's or guardian's federal, state, or local income tax returns, pay an amount equal to the loss of the tax deduction or tax credit. The amount of reimbursement shall be estimated for each year the victim could reasonably be claimed as a dependent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Pay an amount equal to income actually lost by the spouse, parent, sibling, child, or grandparent of the victim because the family member left his or her employment, temporarily or permanently, to care for the victim because of the injury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a crime resulting in bodily injury also results in the death of a victim or serious impairment of a body function of a victim, the court may order up to 3 times the amount of restitution otherwise allowed under this section. As used in this subsection, "serious impairment of a body function of a victim" includes, but is not limited to, 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Loss of a limb or use of a limb.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Subdural hemorrhage or subdural hematoma.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Loss of a body organ.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the victim or victim's estate consents, the order of restitution may require that the defendant make restitution in services in lieu of money.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the victim is deceased or dies, the court shall order that the restitution or remaining restitution be made to those entitled to inherit from the victim's estate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The court shall order restitution to the crime victim services commission or to any individuals, partnerships, corporations, associations, governmental entities, or other legal entities that have compensated the victim or the victim's estate for a loss incurred by the victim to the extent of the compensation paid for that loss. The court shall also order restitution for the costs of services provided to persons or entities that have provided services to the victim as a result of the crime. Services that are subject to restitution under this subsection include, but are not limited to, shelter, food, clothing, and transportation. However, an order of restitution shall require that all restitution to a victim or victim's estate under the order be made before any restitution to any other person or entity under that order is made. The court shall not order restitution to be paid to a victim or victim's estate if the victim or victim's estate has received or is to receive compensation for that loss, and the court shall state on the record with specificity the reasons for its action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Any amount paid to a victim or victim's estate under an order of restitution shall be set off against any amount later recovered as compensatory damages by the victim or the victim's estate in any federal or state civil proceeding and shall reduce the amount payable to a victim or a victim's estate by an award from the crime victim services commission made after an order of restitution under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If not otherwise provided by the court under this subsection, restitution shall be made immediately. However, the court may require that the defendant make restitution under this section within a specified period or in specified installments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If the defendant is placed on probation or paroled or the court imposes a conditional sentence as provided in section 3 of chapter IX of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 769.3, any restitution ordered under this section shall be a condition of that probation, parole, or sentence. The court may revoke probation or impose imprisonment under the conditional sentence and the parole board may revoke parole if the defendant fails to comply with the order and if the defendant has not made a good faith effort to comply with the order. In determining whether to revoke probation or parole or impose imprisonment, the court or parole board shall consider the defendant's employment status, earning ability, and financial resources, the willfulness of the defendant's failure to pay, and any other special circumstances that may have a bearing on the defendant's ability to pay.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Subject to subsection (18), a defendant who is required to pay restitution and who is not in willful default of the payment of the restitution may at any time petition the sentencing judge or his or her successor to modify the method of payment. If the court determines that payment under the order will impose a manifest hardship on the defendant or his or her immediate family, and if the court also determines that modifying the method of payment will not impose a manifest hardship on the victim, the court may modify the method of payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) An order of restitution entered under this section remains effective until it is satisfied in full. An order of restitution is a judgment and lien against all property of the defendant for the amount specified in the order of restitution. The lien may be recorded as provided by law. An order of restitution may be enforced by the prosecuting attorney, a victim, a victim's estate, or any other person or entity named in the order to receive the restitution in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action or a lien.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a defendant shall not be imprisoned, jailed, or incarcerated for a violation of probation or parole or otherwise for failure to pay restitution as ordered under this section unless the court or parole board determines that the defendant has the resources to pay the ordered restitution and has not made a good faith effort to do so.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) If the court determines that a juvenile is or will be unable to pay all of the restitution ordered, after notice to the juvenile's parent or parents and an opportunity for the parent or parents to be heard the court may order the parent or parents having supervisory responsibility for the juvenile at the time of the acts upon which an order of restitution is based to pay any portion of the restitution ordered that is outstanding. An order under this subsection does not relieve the juvenile of his or her obligation to pay restitution as ordered, but the amount owed by the juvenile shall be offset by any amount paid by his or her parent. As used in this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Juvenile" means a person within the court's jurisdiction under section 2d or 4 of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.2d and 712A.4.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Parent" does not include a foster parent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) If the court orders a parent to pay restitution under subsection (15), the court shall take into account the parent's financial resources and the burden that the payment of restitution will impose, with due regard to any other moral or legal financial obligations the parent may have. If a parent is required to pay restitution under subsection (15), the court shall provide for payment to be made in specified installments and within a specified period of time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) A parent who has been ordered to pay restitution under subsection (15) may petition the court for a modification of the amount of restitution owed by the parent or for a cancellation of any unpaid portion of the parent's obligation. The court shall cancel all or part of the parent's obligation due if the court determines that payment of the amount due will impose a manifest hardship on the parent and if the court also determines that modifying the method of payment will not impose a manifest hardship on the victim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) In each case in which payment of restitution is ordered as a condition of probation, the court shall order any employed defendant to make regularly scheduled restitution payments. If the defendant misses 2 or more regularly scheduled payments, the court shall order the defendant to execute a wage assignment to pay the restitution. The probation officer assigned to the case shall review the case not less than twice yearly to ensure that restitution is being paid as ordered. If the restitution was ordered to be made within a specific period of time, the probation officer assigned to the case shall review the case at the end of the specific period of time to determine if the restitution has been paid in full. The final review shall be conducted not less than 60 days before the probationary period expires. If the probation officer determines at any review that restitution is not being paid as ordered, the probation officer shall file a written report of the violation with the court on a form prescribed by the state court administrative office or shall petition the court for a probation violation. The report or petition shall include a statement of the amount of the arrearage and any reasons for the arrearage known by the probation officer. The probation officer shall immediately provide a copy of the report or petition to the prosecuting attorney. If a petition or motion is filed or other proceedings are initiated to enforce payment of restitution and the court determines that restitution is not being paid or has not been paid as ordered by the court, the court shall promptly take action necessary to compel compliance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) If a defendant who is ordered to pay restitution under this section is remanded to the jurisdiction of the department of corrections, the court shall provide a copy of the order of restitution to the department of corrections when the defendant is remanded to the department's jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) The court shall not impose a fee on a victim, victim's estate, or prosecuting attorney for enforcing an order of restitution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) If a person or entity entitled to restitution under this section cannot be located, refuses to claim the restitution within 2 years after the date on which he or she could have claimed the restitution, or refuses to accept the restitution, the restitution to which that person or entity is entitled shall be deposited in the crime victim's rights fund created under section 4 of 1989 PA 196, MCL 780.904, or its successor fund. However, a person or entity entitled to that restitution may claim that restitution any time by applying to the court that originally ordered and collected it. The court shall notify the crime victim services commission of the application and the commission shall approve a reduction in the court's revenue transmittal to the crime victim's rights fund equal to the restitution owed to the person or entity. The court shall use the reduction to reimburse that restitution to the person or entity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) The court may amend an order of restitution entered under this section on a motion by the prosecuting attorney, the victim, or the defendant based upon new information related to the injury, damages, or loss for which the restitution was ordered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(23) A court that receives notice that a defendant who has an obligation to pay restitution under this section has declared bankruptcy shall forward a copy of that notice to the prosecuting attorney. The prosecuting attorney shall forward the notice to the victim at the victim's last known address.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(24) If the victim is a minor, the order of restitution shall require the defendant to pay to a parent of the victim an amount that is determined to be reasonable for any of the following that are actually incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the parent as a result of the crime:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Homemaking and child care expenses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Income loss not ordered to be paid under subsection (4)(h).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Mileage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Lodging or housing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Meals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Any other cost incurred in exercising the rights of the victim or a parent under this act.</div>

If a person is subject to fines, costs, restitution, assessments, probation or parole supervision fees, or other payments in more than 1 proceeding in a court and if a person making a payment on the fines, costs, restitution, assessments, probation or parole supervision fees, or other payments does not indicate the proceeding for which the payment is made, the court shall first apply the money paid to a proceeding in which there is unpaid restitution to be allocated as provided in this section.</div>

If a person making a payment indicates that the payment is to be applied to victim payments, or if the payment is received as a result of a wage assignment under section 16 or from the department of corrections or sheriff under section 17a, the payment shall first be applied to victim payments. If any fines, costs, supervision fees, or other assessments or payments remain unpaid after all of the victim payments have been paid, any additional money collected shall be applied to payment of those fines, costs, supervision fees, or other assessments or payments. If any victim payments remain unpaid after all of the fines, costs, supervision fees, or other assessments or payments have been paid, any additional money collected shall be applied to payment of those victim payments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In cases involving prosecutions for violations of state law, money allocated under subsection (2) for payment of fines, costs, probation and parole supervision fees, and assessments or payments other than victim payments shall be applied in the following order of priority:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As used in this section only:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Offense" means a violation of a penal law of this state or a violation of an ordinance of a local unit of government of this state punishable by imprisonment or by a fine that is not a civil fine.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Victim" means an individual who suffers direct or threatened physical, financial, or emotional harm as a result of the commission of an offense. As used in subsections (2), (3), (6), (8), (9), and (13) only, victim includes a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, association, governmental entity, or any other legal entity that suffers direct physical or financial harm as a result of an offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as provided in subsection (8), at the dispositional hearing or sentencing for an offense, the court shall order, in addition to or in lieu of any other disposition or penalty authorized by law, that the juvenile make full restitution to any victim of the juvenile's course of conduct that gives rise to the disposition or conviction or to the victim's estate. For an offense that is resolved informally by means of a consent calendar diversion or by another informal method that does not result in a dispositional hearing, by assignment to youthful trainee status, by a delayed sentence or deferred judgment of guilt, or in another way that is not an acquittal or unconditional dismissal, the court shall order the restitution required under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If an offense results in damage to or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the offense or results in the seizure or impoundment of property of a victim of the offense, the order of restitution shall require that the juvenile do 1 or more of the following, as applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Return the property to the owner of the property or to a person designated by the owner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If return of the property under subdivision (a) is impossible, impractical, or inadequate, pay an amount equal to the greater of subparagraph (i) or (ii), less the value, determined as of the date the property is returned, of that property or any part of the property that is returned:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The fair market value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction. However, if the fair market value of the property cannot be determined or is impractical to ascertain, then the replacement value of the property shall be utilized in lieu of the fair market value.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The fair market value of the property on the date of disposition. However, if the fair market value of the property cannot be determined or is impractical to ascertain, then the replacement value of the property shall be utilized in lieu of the fair market value.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Pay the costs of the seizure or impoundment, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If an offense results in physical or psychological injury to a victim, the order of restitution shall require that the juvenile do 1 or more of the following, as applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Pay an amount equal to the reasonably determined cost of medical and related professional services and devices actually incurred and reasonably expected to be incurred relating to physical and psychological care.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Pay an amount equal to the reasonably determined cost of physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation actually incurred and reasonably expected to be incurred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Reimburse the victim or the victim's estate for after-tax income loss suffered by the victim as a result of the offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Pay an amount equal to the reasonably determined cost of psychological and medical treatment for members of the victim's family actually incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred as a result of the offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Pay an amount equal to the reasonably determined costs of homemaking and child care expenses actually incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred as a result of the offense or, if homemaking or child care is provided without compensation by a relative, friend, or any other person, an amount equal to the costs that would reasonably be incurred as a result of the offense for that homemaking and child care, based on the rates in the area for comparable services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Pay an amount equal to the cost of actual funeral and related services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) If the deceased victim could be claimed as a dependent by his or her parent or guardian on the parent's or guardian's federal, state, or local income tax returns, pay an amount equal to the loss of the tax deduction or tax credit. The amount of reimbursement shall be estimated for each year the victim could reasonably be claimed as a dependent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Pay an amount equal to income actually lost by the spouse, parent, sibling, child, or grandparent of the victim because the family member left his or her employment, temporarily or permanently, to care for the victim because of the injury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If an offense resulting in bodily injury also results in the death of a victim or serious impairment of a body function of a victim, the court may order up to 3 times the amount of restitution otherwise allowed under this section. As used in this subsection, "serious impairment of a body function of a victim" includes, but is not limited to, 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Loss of a limb or use of a limb.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Loss of a hand or foot or use of a hand or foot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Loss of an eye or use of an eye or ear.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Loss or substantial impairment of a bodily function.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Serious visible disfigurement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A comatose state that lasts for more than 3 days.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Measurable brain damage or mental impairment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) A skull fracture or other serious bone fracture.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Subdural hemorrhage or subdural hematoma.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Loss of a body organ.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the victim or victim's estate consents, the order of restitution may require that the juvenile make restitution in services in lieu of money.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the victim is deceased or dies, the court shall order that the restitution or remaining restitution be made to those entitled to inherit from the victim's estate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The court shall order restitution to the crime victim services commission or to any individuals, partnerships, corporations, associations, governmental entities, or other legal entities that have compensated the victim or the victim's estate for a loss incurred by the victim to the extent of the compensation paid for that loss. The court shall also order restitution for the costs of services provided to persons or entities that have provided services to the victim as a result of the offense. Services that are subject to restitution under this subsection include, but are not limited to, shelter, food, clothing, and transportation. However, an order of restitution shall require that all restitution to a victim or victim's estate under the order be made before any restitution to any other person or entity under that order is made. The court shall not order restitution to be paid to a victim or victim's estate if the victim or victim's estate has received or is to receive compensation for that loss, and the court shall state on the record with specificity the reasons for its action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Any amount paid to a victim or victim's estate under an order of restitution shall be set off against any amount later recovered as compensatory damages by the victim or the victim's estate in any federal or state civil proceeding and shall reduce the amount payable to a victim or a victim's estate by an award from the crime victim services commission made after an order of restitution under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If not otherwise provided by the court under this subsection, restitution shall be made immediately. However, the court may require that the juvenile make restitution under this section within a specified period or in specified installments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If the juvenile is placed on probation, any restitution ordered under this section shall be a condition of that probation. The court may revoke probation if the juvenile fails to comply with the order and if the juvenile has not made a good faith effort to comply with the order. In determining whether to revoke probation, the court shall consider the juvenile's employment status, earning ability, and financial resources, the willfulness of the juvenile's failure to pay, and any other special circumstances that may have a bearing on the juvenile's ability to pay.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Subject to subsection (18), a juvenile who is required to pay restitution and who is not in willful default of the payment of the restitution may at any time petition the court to modify the method of payment. If the court determines that payment under the order will impose a manifest hardship on the juvenile or his or her immediate family, and if the court also determines that modifying the method of payment will not impose a manifest hardship on the victim, the court may modify the method of payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) An order of restitution entered under this section remains effective until it is satisfied in full. An order of restitution is a judgment and lien against all property of the individual ordered to pay restitution for the amount specified in the order of restitution. The lien may be recorded as provided by law. An order of restitution may be enforced by the prosecuting attorney, a victim, a victim's estate, or any other person or entity named in the order to receive the restitution in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action or a lien.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a juvenile shall not be detained or imprisoned for a violation of probation or parole or otherwise for failure to pay restitution as ordered under this section unless the court determines that the juvenile has the resources to pay the ordered restitution and has not made a good faith effort to do so.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) If the court determines that the juvenile is or will be unable to pay all of the restitution ordered, after notice to the juvenile's parent or parents and an opportunity for the parent or parents to be heard, the court may order the parent or parents having supervisory responsibility for the juvenile at the time of the acts upon which an order of restitution is based to pay any portion of the restitution ordered that is outstanding. An order under this subsection does not relieve the juvenile of his or her obligation to pay restitution as ordered, but the amount owed by the juvenile shall be offset by any amount paid by his or her parent. As used in this subsection, "parent" does not include a foster parent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) If the court orders a parent to pay restitution under subsection (15), the court shall take into account the parent's financial resources and the burden that the payment of restitution will impose, with due regard to any other moral or legal financial obligations the parent may have. If a parent is required to pay restitution under subsection (15), the court shall provide for payment to be made in specified installments and within a specified period of time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) A parent who has been ordered to pay restitution under subsection (15) may petition the court for a modification of the amount of restitution owed by the parent or for a cancellation of any unpaid portion of the parent's obligation. The court shall cancel all or part of the parent's obligation due if the court determines that payment of the amount due will impose a manifest hardship on the parent and if the court also determines that modifying the method of payment will not impose a manifest hardship on the victim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) In each case in which payment of restitution is ordered as a condition of probation, the court shall order any employed juvenile to make regularly scheduled restitution payments. If the juvenile misses 2 or more regularly scheduled payments, the court shall order the juvenile to execute a wage assignment to pay the restitution. The juvenile caseworker or probation officer assigned to the case shall review the case not less than twice yearly to ensure that restitution is being paid as ordered. If the restitution was ordered to be made within a specific period of time, the juvenile caseworker or probation officer assigned to the case shall review the case at the end of the specific period of time to determine if the restitution has been paid in full. The final review shall be conducted not less than 60 days before the probationary period expires. If the juvenile caseworker or probation officer determines at any review the restitution is not being paid as ordered, the juvenile caseworker or probation officer shall file a written report of the violation with the court on a form prescribed by the state court administrative office or shall petition the court for a probation violation. The report or petition shall include a statement of the amount of the arrearage, and any reasons for the arrearage known by the juvenile caseworker or probation officer. The juvenile caseworker or probation officer shall immediately provide a copy of the report or petition to the prosecuting attorney. If a petition or motion is filed or other proceedings are initiated to enforce payment of restitution and the court determines that restitution is not being paid or has not been paid as ordered by the court, the court shall promptly take action necessary to compel compliance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) If the court determines that an individual who is ordered to pay restitution under this section is remanded to the jurisdiction of the department of corrections, the court shall provide a copy of the order of restitution to the department of corrections when the court determines that the individual is remanded to the department's jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) The court shall not impose a fee on a victim, victim's estate, or prosecuting attorney for enforcing an order of restitution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) If a person or entity entitled to restitution under this section cannot be located, refuses to claim the restitution within 2 years after the date on which he or she could have claimed the restitution, or refuses to accept the restitution, the restitution to which that person or entity is entitled shall be deposited in the crime victim's rights fund created under section 4 of 1989 PA 196, MCL 780.904, or its successor fund. However, a person or entity entitled to that restitution may claim that restitution any time by applying to the court that originally ordered and collected it. The court shall notify the crime victim services commission of the application and the commission shall approve a reduction in the court's revenue transmittal to the crime victim's rights fund equal to the restitution owed to the person or entity. The court shall use the reduction to reimburse that restitution to the person or entity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) The court may amend an order of restitution entered under this section on a motion by the prosecuting attorney, the victim, or the defendant based upon new information related to the injury, damages, or loss for which the restitution was ordered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(23) A court that receives notice that a defendant who has an obligation to pay restitution under this section has declared bankruptcy shall forward a copy of that notice to the prosecuting attorney. The prosecuting attorney shall forward the notice to the victim at the victim's last known address.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(24) If the victim is a minor, the order of restitution shall require the defendant to pay to a parent of the victim an amount that is determined to be reasonable for any of the following that are actually incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the parent as a result of the crime:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Homemaking and child care expenses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Income loss not ordered to be paid under subsection (4)(h).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Mileage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Lodging or housing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Meals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Any other cost incurred in exercising the rights of the victim or a parent under this act.</div>

If a person is subject to fines, costs, restitution, assessments, probation or parole supervision fees, or other payments in more than 1 proceeding in a court and if a person making a payment on the fines, costs, restitution, assessments, probation or parole supervision fees, or other payments does not indicate the proceeding for which the payment is made, the court shall first apply the money paid to a proceeding in which there is unpaid restitution to be allocated as provided in this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As used in this section only:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Misdemeanor" means a violation of a law of this state or a local ordinance that is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 1 year or a fine that is not a civil fine, but that is not a felony.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Victim" means an individual who suffers direct or threatened physical, financial, or emotional harm as a result of the commission of a misdemeanor. As used in subsections (2), (3), (6), (8), (9), and (13) only, victim includes a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, association, governmental entity, or any other legal entity that suffers direct physical or financial harm as a result of a misdemeanor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as provided in subsection (8), when sentencing a defendant convicted of a misdemeanor, the court shall order, in addition to or in lieu of any other penalty authorized by law or in addition to any other penalty required by law, that the defendant make full restitution to any victim of the defendant's course of conduct that gives rise to the conviction or to the victim's estate. For an offense that is resolved by assignment of the defendant to youthful trainee status, by a delayed sentence or deferred judgment of guilt, or in another way that is not an acquittal or unconditional dismissal, the court shall order the restitution required under this section. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a misdemeanor results in damage to or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the misdemeanor or results in the seizure or impoundment of property of a victim of the misdemeanor, the order of restitution shall require that the defendant do 1 or more of the following, as applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Return the property to the owner of the property or to a person designated by the owner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If return of the property under subdivision (a) is impossible, impractical, or inadequate, pay an amount equal to the greater of subparagraph (i) or (ii), less the value, determined as of the date the property is returned, of that property or any part of the property that is returned:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The fair market value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction. However, if the fair market value of the property cannot be determined or is impractical to ascertain, then the replacement value of the property shall be utilized in lieu of the fair market value.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The fair market value of the property on the date of sentencing. However, if the fair market value of the property cannot be determined or is impractical to ascertain, then the replacement value of the property shall be utilized in lieu of the fair market value.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Pay the costs of the seizure or impoundment, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a misdemeanor results in physical or psychological injury to a victim, the order of restitution shall require that the defendant do 1 or more of the following, as applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Pay an amount equal to the reasonably determined cost of medical and related professional services and devices actually incurred and reasonably expected to be incurred relating to physical and psychological care.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Pay an amount equal to the reasonably determined cost of physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation actually incurred and reasonably expected to be incurred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Reimburse the victim or the victim's estate for after-tax income loss suffered by the victim as a result of the misdemeanor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Pay an amount equal to the reasonably determined cost of psychological and medical treatment for members of the victim's family actually incurred and reasonably expected to be incurred as a result of the misdemeanor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Pay an amount equal to the reasonably determined costs of homemaking and child care expenses actually incurred and reasonably expected to be incurred as a result of the misdemeanor or, if homemaking or child care is provided without compensation by a relative, friend, or any other person, an amount equal to the costs that would reasonably be incurred as a result of the misdemeanor for that homemaking and child care, based on the rates in the area for comparable services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Pay an amount equal to the cost of actual funeral and related services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) If the deceased victim could be claimed as a dependent by his or her parent or guardian on the parent's or guardian's federal, state, or local income tax returns, pay an amount equal to the loss of the tax deduction or tax credit. The amount of reimbursement shall be estimated for each year the victim could reasonably be claimed as a dependent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Pay an amount equal to income actually lost by the spouse, parent, sibling, child, or grandparent of the victim because the family member left his or her employment, temporarily or permanently, to care for the victim because of the injury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a crime resulting in bodily injury also results in the death of a victim or serious impairment of a body function of a victim, the court may order up to 3 times the amount of restitution otherwise allowed under this section. As used in this subsection, "serious impairment of a body function of a victim" includes, but is not limited to, 1 or more of the following: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Loss of a limb or use of a limb.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Loss of a hand or foot or use of a hand or foot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Loss of an eye or use of an eye or ear.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Loss or substantial impairment of a bodily function.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A comatose state that lasts for more than 3 days.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Measurable brain damage or mental impairment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) A skull fracture or other serious bone fracture.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Subdural hemorrhage or subdural hematoma.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Loss of a body organ.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the victim or victim's estate consents, the order of restitution may require that the defendant make restitution in services in lieu of money.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the victim is deceased or dies, the court shall order that the restitution or remaining restitution be made to those entitled to inherit from the victim's estate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The court shall order restitution to the crime victim services commission or to any individuals, partnerships, corporations, associations, governmental entities, or other legal entities that have compensated the victim or the victim's estate for a loss incurred by the victim to the extent of the compensation paid for that loss. The court shall also order restitution for the costs of services provided to persons or entities that have provided services to the victim as a result of the misdemeanor. Services that are subject to restitution under this subsection include, but are not limited to, shelter, food, clothing, and transportation. However, an order of restitution shall require that all restitution to a victim or victim's estate under the order be made before any restitution to any other person or entity under that order is made. The court shall not order restitution to be paid to a victim or victim's estate if the victim or victim's estate has received or is to receive compensation for that loss, and the court shall state on the record with specificity the reasons for its action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Any amount paid to a victim or victim's estate under an order of restitution shall be set off against any amount later recovered as compensatory damages by the victim or the victim's estate in any federal or state civil proceeding and shall reduce the amount payable to a victim or a victim's estate by an award from the crime victim services commission made after an order of restitution under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If not otherwise provided by the court under this subsection, restitution shall be made immediately. However, the court may require that the defendant make restitution under this section within a specified period or in specified installments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If the defendant is placed on probation or the court imposes a conditional sentence as provided in section 3 of chapter IX of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 769.3, any restitution ordered under this section shall be a condition of that probation or sentence. The court may revoke probation or impose imprisonment under the conditional sentence if the defendant fails to comply with the order and if the defendant has not made a good faith effort to comply with the order. In determining whether to revoke probation or impose imprisonment, the court shall consider the defendant's employment status, earning ability, and financial resources, the willfulness of the defendant's failure to pay, and any other special circumstances that may have a bearing on the defendant's ability to pay.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Subject to subsection (15), a defendant who is required to pay restitution and who is not in willful default of the payment of the restitution may at any time petition the sentencing judge or his or her successor to modify the method of payment. If the court determines that payment under the order will impose a manifest hardship on the defendant or his or her immediate family, and if the court also determines that modifying the method of payment will not impose a manifest hardship on the victim, the court may modify the method of payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) An order of restitution entered under this section remains effective until it is satisfied in full. An order of restitution is a judgment and lien against all property of the defendant for the amount specified in the order of restitution. The lien may be recorded as provided by law. An order of restitution may be enforced by the prosecuting attorney, a victim, a victim's estate, or any other person or entity named in the order to receive restitution in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action or a lien.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a defendant shall not be imprisoned, jailed, or incarcerated for a violation of probation or otherwise for failure to pay restitution as ordered under this section unless the court determines that the defendant has the resources to pay the ordered restitution and has not made a good faith effort to do so.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) In each case in which payment of restitution is ordered as a condition of probation, the court shall order any employed defendant to make regularly scheduled restitution payments. If the defendant misses 2 or more regularly scheduled payments, the court shall order the defendant to execute a wage assignment to pay the restitution. The probation officer assigned to the case shall review the case not less than twice yearly to ensure that restitution is being paid as ordered. If the restitution was ordered to be made within a specific period of time, the probation officer assigned to the case shall review the case at the end of the specific period of time to determine if the restitution has been paid in full. The final review shall be conducted not less than 60 days before the probationary period expires. If the probation officer determines at any review that restitution is not being paid as ordered, the probation officer shall file a written report of the violation with the court on a form prescribed by the state court administrative office or shall petition the court for a probation violation. The report or petition shall include a statement of the amount of the arrearage and any reasons for the arrearage known by the probation officer. The probation officer shall immediately provide a copy of the report or petition to the prosecuting attorney. If a petition or motion is filed or other proceedings are initiated to enforce payment of restitution and the court determines that restitution is not being paid or has not been paid as ordered by the court, the court shall promptly take action necessary to compel compliance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) If the court determines that a defendant who is ordered to pay restitution under this section is remanded to the jurisdiction of the department of corrections, the court shall provide a copy of the order of restitution to the department of corrections when the court determines that the defendant is remanded to the department's jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) The court shall not impose a fee on a victim, victim's estate, or prosecuting attorney for enforcing an order of restitution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) If a person or entity entitled to restitution under this section cannot be located, refuses to claim the restitution within 2 years after the date on which he or she could have claimed the restitution, or refuses to accept the restitution, the restitution to which that person or entity is entitled shall be deposited in the crime victim's rights fund created under section 4 of 1989 PA 196, MCL 780.904, or its successor fund. However, a person or entity entitled to that restitution may claim that restitution any time by applying to the court that originally ordered and collected it. The court shall notify the crime victim services commission of the application and the commission shall approve a reduction in the court's revenue transmittal to the crime victim's rights fund equal to the restitution owed to the person or entity. The court shall use the reduction to reimburse that restitution to the person or entity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) The court may amend an order of restitution entered under this section on a motion by the prosecuting attorney, the victim, or the defendant based upon new information related to the injury, damages, or loss for which the restitution was ordered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) A court that receives notice that a defendant who has an obligation to pay restitution under this section has declared bankruptcy shall forward a copy of that notice to the prosecuting attorney. The prosecuting attorney shall forward the notice to the victim at the victim's last known address.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) If the victim is a minor, the order of restitution shall require the defendant pay to a parent of the victim an amount that is determined to be reasonable for any of the following that are actually incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the parent as a result of the crime:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Homemaking and child care expenses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Income loss not ordered to be paid under subsection (4)(h).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Mileage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Lodging or housing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Meals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Any other cost incurred in exercising the rights of the victim or a parent under this act.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a person is subject to any combination of fines, costs, restitution, assessments, probation or parole supervision fees, or other payments arising out of the same criminal proceeding, money collected from that person for the payment of fines, costs, restitution, assessments, probation or parole supervision fees, or other payments ordered to be paid in that proceeding shall be allocated as provided in this section. If a person is subject to fines, costs, restitution, assessments, probation or parole supervision fees, or other payments in more than 1 proceeding in a court and if a person making a payment on the fines, costs, restitution, assessments, probation or parole supervision fees, or other payments does not indicate the proceeding for which the payment is made, the court shall first apply the money paid to a proceeding in which there is unpaid restitution to be allocated as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if a person is subject to payment of victim payments and any combination of other fines, costs, assessments, probation or parole supervision fees, or other payments, 50% of each payment collected by the court from that person shall be applied to payment of victim payments, and the balance shall be applied to payment of fines, costs, supervision fees, and other assessments or payments. If a person making a payment indicates that the payment is to be applied to victim payments, or if the payment is received as a result of a wage assignment under section 76 or from the sheriff under section 80a, the payment shall first be applied to victim payments. If any fines, costs, supervision fees, or other assessments or payments remain unpaid after all of the victim payments have been paid, any additional money collected shall be applied to payment of those fines, costs, supervision fees, or other assessments or payments. If any victim payments remain unpaid after all of the fines, costs, supervision fees, or other assessments or payments have been paid, any additional money collected shall be applied to payment of those victim payments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In cases involving prosecutions for violations of state law, money allocated under subsection (2) for payment of fines, costs, probation and parole supervision fees, and assessments or payments other than victim payments shall be applied in the following order of priority:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The Michigan indigent defense commission is established within the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The MIDC is an autonomous entity within the department. Except as otherwise provided by law, the MIDC shall exercise its statutory powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities independently of the department. The department shall provide support and coordinated services as requested by the MIDC including providing personnel, budgeting, procurement, and other administrative support to the MIDC sufficient to carry out its duties, powers, and responsibilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The MIDC shall propose minimum standards for the local delivery of indigent criminal defense services providing effective assistance of counsel to adults throughout this state. These minimum standards must be designed to ensure the provision of indigent criminal defense services that meet constitutional requirements for effective assistance of counsel. However, these minimum standards must not infringe on the supreme court's authority over practice and procedure in the courts of this state as set forth in section 5 of article VI of the state constitution of 1963.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The commission shall convene a public hearing before a proposed standard is recommended to the department. A minimum standard proposed under this subsection must be submitted to the department for approval or rejection. Opposition to a proposed minimum standard may be submitted to the department in a manner prescribed by the department. An indigent criminal defense system that objects to a recommended minimum standard on the ground that the recommended minimum standard would exceed the MIDC's statutory authority shall state specifically how the recommended minimum standard would exceed the MIDC's statutory authority. A proposed minimum standard is final when it is approved by the department. A minimum standard that is approved by the department is not subject to challenge through the appellate procedures in section 15. An approved minimum standard for the local delivery of indigent criminal defense services within an indigent criminal defense system is not a rule as that term is defined in section 7 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.207.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Approval of a minimum standard proposed by the MIDC is considered a final department action subject to judicial review under section 28 of article VI of the state constitution of 1963 to determine whether the approved minimum standard is authorized by law. Jurisdiction and venue for judicial review are vested in the court of claims. An indigent criminal defense system may file a petition for review in the court of claims within 60 days after the date of mailing notice of the department's final decision on the recommended minimum standard. The filing of a petition for review does not stay enforcement of an approved minimum standard, but the department may grant, or the court of claims may order, a stay upon appropriate terms.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The MIDC shall identify and encourage best practices for delivering the effective assistance of counsel to indigent defendants charged with crimes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The MIDC shall identify and implement a system of performance metrics to assess the provision of indigent defense services in this state relative to national standards and benchmarks. The MIDC shall provide an annual report to the governor, legislature, supreme court, and the state budget director on the performance metrics not later than December 15 of each year.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Defense counsel's ability, training, and experience match the nature and complexity of the case to which he or she is appointed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The same defense counsel continuously represents and personally appears at every court appearance throughout the pendency of the case. However, indigent criminal defense systems may exempt ministerial, nonsubstantive tasks, and hearings from this prescription.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Indigent criminal defense systems employ only defense counsel who have attended continuing legal education relevant to counsels' indigent defense clients.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Indigent criminal defense systems systematically review defense counsel at the local level for efficiency and for effective representation according to MIDC standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The following requirements apply to the application for, and appointment of, indigent criminal defense services under this act:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A preliminary inquiry regarding, and the determination of, the indigency of any defendant, including a determination regarding whether a defendant is partially indigent, for purposes of this act must be made as determined by the indigent criminal defense system not later than at the defendant's first appearance in court. The determination may be reviewed by the indigent criminal defense system at any other stage of the proceedings. In determining whether a defendant is entitled to the appointment of counsel, the indigent criminal defense system shall consider whether the defendant is indigent and the extent of his or her ability to pay. Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, income or funds from employment or any other source, including personal public assistance, to which the defendant is entitled, property owned by the defendant or in which he or she has an economic interest, outstanding obligations, the number and ages of the defendant's dependents, employment and job training history, and his or her level of education. A trial court may play a role in this determination as part of any indigent criminal defense system's compliance plan under the direction and supervision of the supreme court, consistent with section 4 of article VI of the state constitution of 1963. If an indigent criminal defense system determines that a defendant is partially indigent, the indigent criminal defense system shall determine the amount of money the defendant must contribute to his or her defense. An indigent criminal defense system's determination regarding the amount of money a partially indigent defendant must contribute to his or her defense is subject to judicial review. Nothing in this act prevents a court from making a determination of indigency for any purpose consistent with article VI of the state constitution of 1963. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A defendant is considered to be indigent if he or she is unable, without substantial financial hardship to himself or herself or to his or her dependents, to obtain competent, qualified legal representation on his or her own. Substantial financial hardship is rebuttably presumed if the defendant receives personal public assistance, including under the food assistance program, temporary assistance for needy families, Medicaid, or disability insurance, resides in public housing, or earns an income less than 140% of the federal poverty guideline. A defendant is also rebuttably presumed to have a substantial financial hardship if he or she is currently serving a sentence in a correctional institution or is receiving residential treatment in a mental health or substance abuse facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A defendant not falling below the presumptive thresholds described in subdivision (b) must be subjected to a more rigorous screening process to determine if his or her particular circumstances, including the seriousness of the charges being faced, his or her monthly expenses, and local private counsel rates would result in a substantial hardship if he or she were required to retain private counsel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A determination that a defendant is partially indigent may only be made if the indigent criminal defense system determines that a defendant is not fully indigent. An indigent criminal defense system that determines a defendant is not fully indigent but may be partially indigent must utilize the screening process under subdivision (c). The provisions of subdivision (e) apply to a partially indigent defendant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The MIDC shall promulgate objective standards for indigent criminal defense systems to determine whether a defendant is indigent or partially indigent. These standards must include availability of prompt judicial review, under the direction and supervision of the supreme court, if the indigent criminal defense system is making the determination regarding a defendant's indigency or partial indigency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The MIDC shall promulgate objective standards for indigent criminal defense systems to determine the amount a partially indigent defendant must contribute to his or her defense. The standards must include availability of prompt judicial review, under the direction and supervision of the supreme court, if the indigent criminal defense system is making the determination regarding how much a partially indigent defendant must contribute to his or her defense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) A defendant is responsible for applying for indigent defense counsel and for establishing his or her indigency and eligibility for appointed counsel under this act. Any oral or written statements made by the defendant in or for use in the criminal proceeding and material to the issue of his or her indigency must be made under oath or an equivalent affirmation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The MIDC shall establish standards for trainers and organizations conducting training that receive MIDC funds for training and education. The standards established under this subsection must require that the MIDC analyze the quality of the training, and must require that the effectiveness of the training be capable of being measured and validated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An indigent criminal defense system may include in its compliance plan a request that the MIDC serve as a clearinghouse for experts and investigators. If an indigent criminal defense system makes a request under this subsection, the MIDC may develop and operate a system for determining the need and availability for an expert or investigator in individual cases.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) All indigent criminal defense systems and, at the direction of the supreme court, attorneys engaged in providing indigent criminal defense services shall cooperate and participate with the MIDC in the investigation, audit, and review of their indigent criminal defense services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An indigent criminal defense system may submit to the MIDC an estimate of the cost of developing the plan and cost analysis for implementing the plan under subsection (3) to the MIDC for approval. If approved, the MIDC shall award the indigent criminal defense system a grant to pay the approved costs for developing the plan and cost analysis under subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) No later than 180 days after a standard is approved by the department, each indigent criminal defense system shall submit a plan to the MIDC for the provision of indigent criminal defense services in a manner as determined by the MIDC and shall submit an annual plan for the following state fiscal year on or before October 1 of each year. A plan submitted under this subsection must specifically address how the minimum standards established by the MIDC under this act will be met and must include a cost analysis for meeting those minimum standards. The standards to be addressed in the annual plan are those approved not less than 180 days before the annual plan submission date. The cost analysis must include a statement of the funds in excess of the local share, if any, necessary to allow its system to comply with the MIDC's minimum standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The MIDC shall approve or disapprove all or any portion of a plan or cost analysis, or both a plan and cost analysis, submitted under subsection (3), and shall do so within 90 calendar days of the submission of the plan and cost analysis. If the MIDC disapproves any part of the plan, the cost analysis, or both the plan and the cost analysis, the indigent criminal defense system shall consult with the MIDC and, for any disapproved portion, submit a new plan, a new cost analysis, or both within 60 calendar days of the mailing date of the official notification of the MIDC's disapproval. If after 3 submissions a compromise is not reached, the dispute must be resolved as provided in section 15. All approved provisions of an indigent criminal defense system's plan and cost analysis must not be delayed by any disapproved portion and must proceed as provided in this act. The MIDC shall not approve a cost analysis or portion of a cost analysis unless it is reasonably and directly related to an indigent defense function.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The MIDC shall submit a report to the governor, the senate majority leader, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the appropriations committees of the senate and house of representatives requesting the appropriation of funds necessary to implement compliance plans after all the systems compliance plans are approved by the MIDC. For standards approved after January 1, 2018, the MIDC shall include a cost analysis for each minimum standard in the report and shall also provide a cost analysis for each minimum standard approved on or before January 1, 2018, if a cost analysis for each minimum standard approved was not provided and shall do so not later than October 31, 2018. The amount requested under this subsection must be equal to the total amount required to achieve full compliance as agreed upon by the MIDC and the indigent criminal defense systems under the approval process provided in subsection (4). The information used to create this report must be made available to the governor, the senate majority leader, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the appropriations committees of the senate and house of representatives.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The MIDC shall submit a report to the governor, the senate majority leader, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the appropriations committees of the senate and house of representatives not later than October 31, 2021 that includes a recommendation regarding the appropriate level of local share, expressed in both total dollars and as a percentage of the total cost of compliance for each indigent criminal defense system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Except as provided in subsection (9), an indigent criminal defense system shall maintain not less than its local share. If the MIDC determines that funding in excess of the indigent criminal defense system's share is necessary in order to bring its system into compliance with the minimum standards established by the MIDC, that excess funding must be paid by this state. The legislature shall appropriate to the MIDC the additional funds necessary for a system to meet and maintain those minimum standards, which must be provided to indigent criminal defense systems through grants as described in subsection (8). The legislature may appropriate funds that apply to less than all of the minimum standards and may provide less than the full amount of the funds requested under subsection (5). Notwithstanding this subsection, it is the intent of the legislature to fund all of the minimum standards contained in the report under subsection (5) within 3 years of the date on which the minimum standards were adopted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) An indigent criminal defense system must not be required to provide funds in excess of its local share. The MIDC shall provide grants to indigent criminal defense systems to assist in bringing the systems into compliance with minimum standards established by the MIDC.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An indigent criminal defense system is not required to expend its local share if the minimum standards established by the MIDC may be met for less than that share, but the local share of a system that expends less than its local share under these circumstances is not reduced by the lower expenditure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) This state shall appropriate funds to the MIDC for grants to the local units of government for the reasonable costs associated with data required to be collected under this act that is over and above the local unit of government's data costs for other purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Within 180 days after receiving funds from the MIDC under subsection (8), an indigent criminal defense system shall comply with the terms of the grant in bringing its system into compliance with the minimum standards established by the MIDC for effective assistance of counsel. The terms of a grant may allow an indigent criminal defense system to exceed 180 days for compliance with a specific item needed to meet minimum standards if necessity is demonstrated in the indigent criminal defense system's compliance plan. The MIDC has the authority to allow an indigent criminal defense system to exceed 180 days for implementation of items if an unforeseeable condition prohibits timely compliance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If an indigent criminal defense system is awarded no funds for implementation of its plan under this act, the MIDC shall nevertheless issue to the system a zero grant reflecting that it will receive no grant funds.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The MIDC may apply for and obtain grants from any source to carry out the purposes of this act. All funds received by MIDC, from any source, are state funds and must be appropriated as provided by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) The MIDC shall ensure proper financial protocols in administering and overseeing funds utilized by indigent criminal defense systems, including, but not limited to, all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Requiring documentation of expenditures.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Requiring each indigent criminal defense system to hold all grant funds in a fund that is separate from other funds held by the indigent criminal defense system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Requiring each indigent criminal defense system to comply with the standards promulgated by the governmental accounting standards board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) If an indigent criminal defense system does not fully expend a grant toward its costs of compliance, its grant in the second succeeding fiscal year must be reduced by the amount equal to the unexpended funds. Identified unexpended grant funds must be reported by indigent criminal defense systems on or before October 31 of each year. Funds subject to extension under subsection (11) must be reported but not included in the reductions described in this subsection. Any grant money that is determined to have been used for a purpose outside of the compliance plan must be repaid to the MIDC, or if not repaid, must be deducted from future grant amounts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) If an indigent criminal defense system expends funds in excess of its local share and the approved MIDC grant to meet unexpected needs in the provision of indigent criminal defense services, the MIDC shall recommend the inclusion of the funds in a subsequent year's grant if all expenditures were reasonably and directly related to indigent criminal defense functions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) The court shall collect contribution or reimbursement from individuals determined to be partially indigent under applicable court rules and statutes. Reimbursement under this subsection is subject to section 22 of chapter XV of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 775.22. The court shall remit 100% of the funds it collects under this subsection to the indigent criminal defense system in which the court is sitting. Twenty percent of the funds received under this subsection by an indigent criminal defense system must be remitted to the department in a manner prescribed by the department and reported to the MIDC by October 31 of each year. The funds received by the department under this subsection must be expended by the MIDC in support of indigent criminal defense systems in this state. The remaining 80% of the funds collected under this subsection may be retained by the indigent criminal defense system for purposes of reimbursing the costs of collecting the funds under this subsection and funding indigent defense in the subsequent fiscal year. The funds collected under this subsection must not alter the calculation of the local share made pursuant to section 3(i).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in section 5, if a dispute arises between the MIDC and an indigent criminal defense system concerning the requirements of this act, including a dispute concerning the approval of an indigent criminal defense system's plan, cost analysis, or compliance with section 13 or 17, the parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute by mediation.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The indigent criminal defense system that is aggrieved by the final plan, cost analysis, or both, may bring an action seeking equitable relief as described in subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The MIDC, or an indigent criminal defense system may bring an action seeking equitable relief in the circuit court only as follows:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The action must be brought in the judicial circuit where the indigent criminal defense service is located.

However, the system must not be required to expend more than its local share in complying with this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a party refuses or fails to comply with a previous order of the court, the court may enforce the previous order through the court's enforcement remedies, including, but not limited to, its contempt powers, and may order that the state undertake the provision of indigent criminal defense services in lieu of the indigent criminal defense system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the court determines that an indigent criminal defense system has breached its duty under section 17(1), the court may order the MIDC to provide indigent criminal defense on behalf of that system. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the court orders the MIDC to provide indigent criminal defense services on behalf of an indigent criminal defense system, the court shall order the system to pay the following amount of the state's costs that the MIDC determines are necessary in order to bring the indigent criminal defense system into compliance with the minimum standards established by the MIDC:</div>
