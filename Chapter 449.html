<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entireties, joint property, common property, or part ownership does not of itself establish a partnership, whether such co-owners do or do not share any profits made by the use of the property;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The sharing of gross returns does not of itself establish a partnership, whether or not the persons sharing them have a joint or common right or interest in any property from which the returns are derived;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is prima facie evidence that he is a partner in the business, but no such inference shall be drawn if such profits were received in payment:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   As a debt by installments or otherwise,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   As wages of an employe or rent to a landlord,</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 9.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   (Partner agent of partnership as to partnership business).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Every partner is an agent of the partnership for the purpose of its business, and the act of every partner, including the execution in the partnership name of any instrument, for apparently carrying on in the usual way the business of the partnership of which he is a member binds the partnership, unless the partner so acting has in fact no authority to act for the partnership in the particular matter, and the person with whom he is dealing has knowledge of the fact that he has no such authority;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An act of a partner which is not apparently for the carrying on of the business of the partnership in the usual way does not bind the partnership unless authorized by the other partners;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Unless authorized by the other partners or unless they have abandoned the business, 1 or more but less than all the partners have no authority to:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Assign the partnership property in trust for creditors or on the assignee's promise to pay the debts of the partnership,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Dispose of the good-will of the business,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Do any other act which would make it impossible to carry on the ordinary business of the partnership,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Confess a judgment,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Submit a partnership claim or liability to arbitration or reference;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   No act of a partner in contravention of a restriction on his authority shall bind the partnership to persons having knowledge of the restriction.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 10.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   (Conveyance of real property of the partnership).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Where title to real property is in the partnership name, any partner may convey a title to such property by a conveyance executed in the partnership name; but the partnership may recover such property unless the partner's act binds the partnership under the provisions of paragraph 1 of section 9, or unless such property has been conveyed by the grantee or a person claiming through such grantee to a holder for value without knowledge that the partner, in making the conveyance, has exceeded his authority;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Where title to real property is in the name of the partnership, a conveyance executed by a partner, in his own name, passes the equitable interest of the partnership, provided the act is one within the authority of the partner under the provisions of paragraph 1 of section 9;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Where title to real property is in the name of 1 or more but not all the partners, and the record does not disclose the right of the partnership, the partners in whose name the title stands may convey title to such property, but the partnership may recover such property if the partners' act does not bind the partnership under the provisions of paragraph 1 of section 9, unless the purchaser or his assignee, is a holder for value, without knowledge;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Where the title to real property is in the name of 1 or more or all the partners, or in a third person in trust for the partnership, a conveyance executed by a partner in the partnership name, or in his own name, passes the equitable interest of the partnership, provided the act is one within the authority of the partner under the provisions of paragraph 1 of section 9;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Where the title to real property is in the names of all the partners a conveyance executed by all the partners passes all their rights in such property.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   When a person, by words spoken or written or by conduct, represents himself, or consents to another representing him to any one, as a partner in an existing partnership or with 1 or more persons not actual partners, he is liable to any such person to whom such representation has been made, who has on the faith of such representation, given credit to the actual or apparent partnership, and if he has made such representation or consented to its being made in a public manner he is liable to such person, whether the representation has or has not been made or communicated to such person, so giving credit by or with the knowledge of the apparent partner making the representation or consenting to its being made;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   When a partnership liability results, he is liable as though he were an actual member of the partnership,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   When no partnership liability results, he is liable jointly with the other persons, if any, so consenting to the contract or representation as to incur liability, otherwise separately;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   When a person has been thus represented to be a partner in an existing partnership, or with 1 or more persons not actual partners, he is an agent of the persons consenting to such representation to bind them to the same extent and in the same manner as though he were a partner in fact, with respect to persons who rely upon the representation.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   (Nature of a partner's right in specific partnership property).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A partner is a co-owner with his partners of specific partnership property holding as a tenant in partnership;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The incidents of this tenancy are such that:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A partner, subject to the provisions of this act and to any agreement between the partners, has an equal right with his partners to possess specific partnership property for partnership purposes; but he has no right to possess such property for any other purpose without the consent of his partners,</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A partner's right in specific partnership property is not subject to attachment or execution, except on a claim against the partnership. When partnership property is attached for a partnership debt, the partners, or any of them, or the representatives of a deceased partner, cannot claim any right under the homestead or exemption laws,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   On the death of a partner his right in specific partnership property vests in the surviving partner or partners, except where the deceased was the last surviving partner, when his right in such property vests in his legal representative.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Every partnership association heretofore or hereafter organized under this act shall annually, in the month of January or February, make duplicate reports for the fiscal year last ending, of such association, on suitable blanks to be furnished by the secretary of state, as hereinafter provided. Such report shall state the amount of capital subscribed, and the amount thereof actually paid in, in cash, and the amount thereof paid in property, if any; the amount of capital invested in real and personal estate, and the present actual value of the same as near as may be estimated; the amount of debts of the association, and the amount of credits, and the present estimated value of the credits; the name and postoffice address of each member and the amount of capital held by each at the date of such report; the name and postoffice address of each officer and manager of the association and such other information as the secretary of state may require. It shall be the duty of the secretary of state in the month of December, in each year, to mail to each such association suitable blanks on which shall be printed a copy of this section. Such reports shall be signed by a majority of the managers and verified by the oath of the secretary of the association, and deposited in the office of the secretary of state within the said month of January or February. The secretary of state shall carefully examine such reports, and if upon such examination they shall be found to comply with all the requirements of this section, he shall file 1 of them in his office and shall forward the other by mail or express to the county clerk of the county in which the principal office, in this state, for the transaction of the business of said association is situated. And it shall be the duty of such county clerk, upon receipt of such report to immediately cause the same to be filed in his office. If any of the managers of any such association shall wilfully neglect or refuse to make and deposit the report required by this section, within the time herein specified, they shall each be liable for all the debts of such association contracted during the period of such neglect or refusal, and subject to a penalty of 25 dollars, and in addition thereto the sum of 5 dollars for each and every secular day after the first of March in each year during the pendency of such neglect or refusal, which penalty shall be for the use and benefit of the general fund of this state. The secretary of state shall, during the last week of June of each year, report to the attorney general in writing, the name and postoffice address of each and every association which has failed to comply with the provisions of this section. And upon the receipt of such report, it shall be the duty of the attorney general to institute proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction, to collect said penalties, and all necessary expenses incurred by the attorney general in such proceedings shall be audited by the board of state auditors, and paid from the general fund of the state. And in case an association organized or doing business under the provisions of this act shall be dissolved by process of law, or whose term of existence shall terminate by limitation, or whose property and franchises shall be sold at mortgage sale or at private sale, it shall be the duty of the last board of managers of such association, within 30 days thereafter, to give written notice of such change to the secretary of state and the county clerk of the county where the principal office of such association is located, signed by a majority of such last board of managers, which said notice shall be recorded as amendments are required to be recorded. And in case of neglect to give such notice, they shall be subject to the same penalties provided in case of neglect to make annual reports, which said penalties shall be collected and applied in the same manner as in case of neglect in making annual reports. The neglect or refusal to file the reports, required by this section to be filed, shall be deemed to be wilful when the report required is not filed within the time herein limited. Whenever any association has neglected or refused to make and file its report within 20 days after the time limited in this section, the secretary of state shall cause notice of that fact to be given by mail to such association, and to each last known officer and manager thereof, directed to their respective postoffice addresses. The certificate of the secretary of state or his deputy, of the mailing of such notices, shall be prima facie evidence in all courts and places of that fact, and that such notices were duly received by said association. All actions and suits based on the neglect or refusal of the officers or managers of such associations to make and file the reports required by this section, shall be commenced within 2 years next after such neglect or refusal has occurred, and not afterwards.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 1105.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A limited partnership formed under any other statute of this state and in existence on the effective date of this act shall not dissolve and its legal existence shall not cease as a result of the repeal of the statute under which it was formed or the enactment of this act. A limited partnership formed under any other statute of this state and in existence on the effective date of this act and the partners thereof shall be governed by the provisions of this act and an existing limited partnership and its partners shall have the same rights and be subject to the same limitations, restrictions, and liabilities as a limited partnership formed under this act and its partners, except as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The partners of an existing limited partnership shall not be required to execute and file a certificate of limited partnership under this act in order to maintain the continued existence of the limited partnership as a limited partnership under the laws of this state; and, as used in this act with respect to an existing limited partnership, unless the context otherwise requires, “certificate of limited partnership” means the certificate of limited partnership of the limited partnership executed and filed pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of the statute under which such limited partnership was formed, and the certificate as amended or restated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An existing limited partnership shall not be subject to the provisions of section 102(1), (3), or (4) with respect to its name as set forth in its certificate of limited partnership on the effective date of this act, but it shall become subject to such provisions if, and at the time, any change in its name is made after the effective date of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   An existing limited partnership may continue to transact its business under an assumed name or names with respect to which there is on file on the effective date of this act a certificate pursuant to Act No. 101 of the Public Acts of 1907, as amended, being sections 445.1 to 445.5 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, by the filing of the certificate referred to in section 104(a), provided that such assumed name or names are not precluded from use by section 102(2) or (5).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   An existing limited partnership shall not be subject to the provisions of section 105(a)(2) until the execution and filing of the restated certificate of limited partnership referred to in subdivision (5), at which time the general partners of an existing limited partnership shall have the obligation, and the right and power, to appoint and thereafter continuously maintain an agent for service of process as required by section 105(a)(2), anything contained in the partnership agreement to the contrary notwithstanding.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The provisions of this act relating to the events requiring, and the method of effecting, an amendment or cancellation of a certificate of limited partnership shall apply to an existing limited partnership to the same extent and in the same way such provisions apply to a limited partnership formed under this act; provided, however, the first amendment of the certificate of limited partnership of an existing limited partnership made after the effective date of this act shall be effected by the execution and filing of a restated certificate of limited partnership setting forth all of the information specified in section 201(a), including, but not limited to, the name and address of the agent for service of process required to be maintained by section 105(a)(2), which information shall be current as of the date of the execution and filing of such restated certificate of limited partnership; and the execution and filing of such restated certificate of limited partnership shall not result in the dissolution, or in any way adversely affect the continued existence, of the existing limited partnership.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The references in sections 202(a)(2), 202(f), and 203(a)(2) to the date of the filing of a limited partnership's original certificate of limited partnership mean, with respect to an existing limited partnership, the date on which the limited partnership's original certificate of limited partnership was filed pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of the statute under which it was formed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A certificate of amendment, a restated certificate of limited partnership, and a certificate of cancellation with respect to an existing limited partnership, in addition to setting forth the information specified in sections 202(a), 202(f), and 203(a), shall state the place where the original certificate of limited partnership was filed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Sections 501, 502, and 608 apply only to contributions and distributions made after the effective date of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   Section 704 applies only to assignments made after the effective date of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Within 30 days after the effective date of this act, the county clerk of each county shall certify and send to the administrator, for filing, the certificate of limited partnership, as amended or restated, of each existing limited partnership which is on file in the office of the county clerk on the effective date of this act. From and after the effective date of this act, (i) all amendments to and restatements of, and a cancellation of, the certificate of limited partnership of an existing limited partnership shall be filed with the administrator and shall be executed and filed in accordance with, and shall otherwise comply, with all of the requirements of this act, and (ii) no such amendment, restatement, or cancellation shall be filed in the office of the county clerk of any county of this state. At the time that the county clerk of each county certifies and sends to the administrator, for filing, the certificate of limited partnership, as amended or restated, of each existing limited partnership which is on file in the office of the county clerk on the effective date of this act, the county clerk shall mail to the general partner of each limited partnership, at his or her address as set forth in the certificate of limited partnership of the limited partnership, as amended or restated, written notice that the certificate of limited partnership of the limited partnership, as amended or restated, has been sent to the administrator for filing, and that from and after the effective date of this act (i) all amendments to and restatements of, and a cancellation of, the certificate of limited partnership of the limited partnership must be filed with the administrator and comply with all of the requirements of this act, and (ii) no such amendment, restatement, or cancellation may be filed in the office of the county clerk.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   This act does not affect a cause of action, liability, penalty or action, or special proceeding, which on the effective date of this act is accrued, existing, incurred, or pending, but the same may be asserted, enforced, prosecuted, or defended as if this act had not been enacted.</DIV>
