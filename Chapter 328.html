</P>
<P>Sec. 8.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A registrant shall keep, in this state, accurate accounts, books, and records of all transactions and accounts regulated by this act. Records shall include copies of all prepaid contracts, the dates and amounts of payments made and accepted under these prepaid contracts, the name and address of each contract buyer, the name and address of the contract beneficiaries, the name and address of each escrow agent, the date and amount of each deposit made to an escrow agent, the total price of each contract exclusive of commission, any commission received for each contract, the date each contract is performed, canceled, or revoked, the date and amount of any refund paid to the contract buyer, and any other records as the department may require to enable it to determine whether the registrant is complying with the requirements of this act. Records shall be kept for at least 36 months after performance of all obligations of each prepaid contract or after the filing of the report that includes a prepaid contract that has been performed. Beginning on April 1, 2006 and each year thereafter, a registrant shall have available for examination by the department a statement, current as of the preceding December 31, disclosing the following information as to each unperformed prepaid funeral contract:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The date of the contract and, if available, the contract number.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The names of the contract buyer and the contract beneficiary.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The face value of the contract. If the registrant is allowed to deposit less than the face value, the statement shall include the amount required to be on deposit with the escrow agent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Whether the contract is a guaranteed or nonguaranteed contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Complete information on the means, provision, trust, or other vehicle that will assure fulfillment of all obligations, stating ledger and market values of the vehicle, its location, nature of investments and trustees including fees paid to trustees. A registrant who has placed funds in a commingled escrow account may satisfy this requirement by identifying the name of the escrow agent and the particular investment account or accounts in which the funds have been placed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Annually, a registrant which serves as an escrow agent or which has deposited funds with an escrow agent pursuant to section 12 shall secure a report prepared by a Michigan licensed certified public accountant pertaining to funds. The report shall be on forms provided by the department. The report shall be prepared and dated on or before July 1 of the year following the calendar year for which the report is prepared. In preparing the report, the Michigan licensed certified public accountant shall not be required to review all prepaid contracts, escrow agreements, escrow accounts, or records of the registrant, nor shall the Michigan licensed certified public accountant be required to review any receipts or deposits by the registrant of funds. The report of the Michigan licensed certified public accountant shall provide the following assurances:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That, based either upon a review of the registrant's agreements with escrow agents or depositories which limit investments of the escrow funds by the escrow agents or depositories to those investments permitted by this act, or upon a review of the investments of the escrow accounts, the investment requirements of section 12 have been complied with.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   In the case of escrow accounts where the registrant serves as the escrow agent, that withdrawals, as detailed in the periodic statements of the depositories in which the escrow accounts are maintained, have been made in compliance with this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   In the case of escrow accounts where the registrant does not serve as the escrow agent, that, based upon a representative test sample selected upon the basis of the professional judgment of the Michigan licensed certified public accountant after considering all risks, funds have been deposited with and held by the escrow agent in accordance with this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   That no matters have come to the attention of the Michigan licensed certified public accountant during the review of escrow account investments and withdrawals that gave cause to believe that the registrant has not complied with this act, or if any matters have come to his or her attention, the Michigan licensed certified public accountant shall include an explanation of the matters which caused the belief that the registrant has not complied with this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The department may examine each report required by this section and if the department determines on the basis of its review that the registrant or its agent has not held or invested funds in accordance with the requirements of this act or has failed to file a report as required, the department shall take any appropriate corrective or penal action authorized by this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The department may examine, review, or audit the books and records of a contract seller or provider pertaining to funds received in payment for prepaid contracts. An audit may include an examination of the books and financial records of the registrant as well as books and financial records of escrow agents used by the registrant. A registrant shall authorize escrow agents to open their records of the registrant accounts to the department upon request. The department may charge the registrant for the actual expenses of the examination, review, or audit but not more than $1,000.00.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   For the purposes of complying with the requirements of this section, a registrant who has not sold, provided, or agreed to provide merchandise or funeral or cemetery services in accordance with a prepaid contract and who has no obligations with respect to an outstanding prepaid contract may submit a sworn statement that a prepaid contract has not been sold, provided, or agreed to and there are no obligations outstanding. The department shall accept the statement in lieu of the report.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Any books or records regarding any prepaid contract entered into before the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection that were in compliance with applicable law are considered in compliance with this act.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A prepaid contract may authorize the contract seller or provider to charge an additional commission of not more than 10% of the contract price which shall not be subject to the depository requirements of this section. If the contract price is paid in installments, the commission retained by the contract seller or the provider shall not exceed the rate of the commission charged in the prepaid contract for each installment. On cancellation, a contract buyer is entitled to a refund as provided in section 13(1) or (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Only the following persons may serve as the escrow agent of funds under this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the prepaid contract is a nonguaranteed price contract, the contract seller or provider of that nonguaranteed price contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the prepaid contract is either a guaranteed or nonguaranteed price contract, a depository, a trust company, or a Michigan nonprofit corporation or association, in which the majority interest is held by 250 or more funeral establishments licensed under article 18 of the occupational code, 1980 PA 299, MCL 339.1801 to 339.1812, or a Michigan nonprofit corporation or association, in which the majority interest is held by 30 or more cemeteries registered and operated pursuant to the cemetery regulation act, 1968 PA 251, MCL 456.521 to 456.543.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the escrow agent is a person other than the person to whom the funds have been paid by the contract buyer, the funds shall be deposited with the escrow agent within 30 days after the receipt by the person to whom the funds are paid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Funds held by an escrow agent shall be held and invested only as specified in the prepaid contract. A prepaid contract may authorize investments only as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the prepaid contract is a nonguaranteed price contract, the funds shall be invested in 1 or more interest-bearing accounts in a depository.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the prepaid contract is a guaranteed price contract, the principal and income may be invested only in accordance with section 7803 of the estates and protected individuals code, 1998 PA 386, MCL 700.7803, except that funds shall not be invested in a company owned by, operated by, or affiliated in any way with a contract seller or provider or an authorized agent of a contract seller or provider or in loans to any person directly connected with or employed by a contract seller or provider or an authorized agent of a contract seller or provider.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Income shall be held and invested by the escrow agent in the same manner as the principal except that the income may be utilized to pay reasonable fees and expenses of the escrow agent in addition to other costs specifically authorized by this act. The expenses and fees paid to the escrow agent shall not exceed 1% of the aggregate balance of principal and prior earned income from each account annually. If a fee is charged for reasonable expenses for the administration costs under an escrow agreement, the amount may be paid to the escrow agent periodically or may be accumulated in the account and paid at the time of death or upon cancellation of the contract. A cemetery that has elected the escrowing option for cemetery merchandise provided in subsection (2) may provide by written agreement with the escrow agent to be paid accumulated income generated solely by the investment of funds received for the cemetery merchandise. Such payments to a cemetery may not be made more frequently than once in a 12-month period and shall not exceed the net amount of income earned in the previous 12 months less any amounts paid to the escrow agent for expenses and fees described in this subsection and an amount equal to any increase in the Detroit consumer price index.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Amounts of principal and income held by an escrow agent other than the contract seller or provider of a nonguaranteed price contract may be commingled with principal and income derived from other prepaid accounts. However, a separate accounting of principal and income shall be maintained for each prepaid contract under the name of the contract beneficiary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The escrow agent shall send to the contract buyer a notice stating the date, amount of the deposit, and the name of the escrow agent with whom the funds are deposited.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Upon the death of the contract beneficiary and upon performance by the provider of its obligation to furnish merchandise or funeral or cemetery services pursuant to the prepaid contract, funds held by the escrow agent shall be disbursed as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the prepaid contract is a nonguaranteed price contract, the principal and income shall first be disbursed by the escrow agent to the provider of the merchandise or funeral or cemetery services in payment of all reasonable charges. Thereafter, not less than 90% of the remaining balance of principal and income, if any, shall be disbursed to the person, other than the provider or the contract seller, designated in the prepaid contract or authorized by law to receive the surplus, and the remainder, if any, shall be disbursed to the provider as final compensation for its services. The amount paid to the person entitled to receive the surplus shall be as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If no commission has been charged pursuant to this section, at least 90% of the remaining balance of principal and income in the escrow account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If a commission of 5% or less of the contract price has been charged, at least 95% of the remaining principal and income in the escrow account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If a commission of greater than 5% of the contract price has been charged, 100% of the remaining principal and income in the escrow account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the prepaid contract is a guaranteed price contract, the principal and income held by the escrow agent shall be disbursed to the provider, its designee, or its successor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the escrow agent is notified that there is a dispute as to whether the provider has performed all its obligations under the prepaid contract, the escrow agent shall file an action for interpleader or shall obtain an impartial arbitrator to determine the rights of the parties. Expenses of arbitration shall be shared equally by the parties unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A Michigan nonprofit corporation or association, in which the majority interest is held by 250 or more funeral establishments or by 30 or more cemeteries registered and operated under the cemetery regulation act, 1968 PA 251, MCL 456.521 to 456.543, may be designated as the escrow agent under this section only if the contract buyer has expressly authorized that designation in writing. If the contract buyer authorizes the appointment as escrow agent of a Michigan nonprofit corporation or association in the prepaid contract, the authorization shall be set forth in a separate paragraph which shall not be effective unless separately signed or initialed by a contract buyer and which shall state that the contract buyer may elect to require that a depository or a trust company be designated as the escrow agent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) If a prepaid contract is canceled, the escrow agent shall disburse the principal and income in accordance with section 13.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) At least annually, unless waived in writing by a contract buyer, a contract buyer shall be furnished a statement indicating the current balance, the fees or expenses charged since the last statement, the amount of the refund to which a buyer is entitled if the contract is canceled, and the name and address of the escrow agent from whom additional information may be obtained about the account. The cost of the statement required by this subsection may be paid from the income and may be in addition to any other fee or charge authorized by this act.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 13.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A contract buyer may cancel a prepaid contract at any time before the death of the contract beneficiary upon 30 days' prior written notice to the contract seller of a nonguaranteed price contract or to the provider designated to furnish merchandise or funeral or cemetery services pursuant to a guaranteed price contract. The contract seller or provider shall promptly notify the escrow agent of the cancellation and of its effective date, if the escrow agent is other than the contract seller or the provider. After receipt of the notice of cancellation, except as otherwise provided in subsection (2), the escrow agent shall disburse not less than 90% of the principal and income in the escrow account to the contract buyer pursuant to this subsection and shall disburse the remainder of the principal and income, if any, to the contract seller or the provider. The refund to the contract buyer shall be determined as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If no commission has been charged pursuant to section 12(1), at least 90% of the remaining balance of principal and income in the escrow account or held by the trustee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If a commission of 5% or less of the contract price has been charged, at least 95% of the remaining principal and income in the escrow account.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If a commission of greater than 5% of the contract price has been charged, 100% of the remaining principal and income in the escrow account.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In the case of funds received for cemetery merchandise by a cemetery that has elected the escrowing option in section 12(2), the escrow agent shall disburse the principal and income in the account to the cemetery and the cemetery shall disburse to the contract buyer 100% of the amount of the contract price paid by the contract buyer plus an amount equal to any increase in the Detroit consumer price index since the contract was executed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A contract seller of a nonguaranteed price contract or a provider designated to furnish merchandise or funeral or cemetery services pursuant to a guaranteed price contract may cancel a prepaid contract only if the contract buyer of a guaranteed price contract is more than 90 days delinquent in making any installment payment or partial payment, or the contract buyer is otherwise in default as to any other obligation under the contract. Upon cancellation, the contract buyer shall receive a refund as determined pursuant to subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   After the death of the contract beneficiary, the contract buyer or the contract buyer's estate may cancel the prepaid contract only where there are no remains of the deceased; where the remains of the deceased cannot be recovered; or where a prepaid contract was not utilized due to lack of knowledge by the person or persons entitled to make funeral arrangements of the existence of the prepaid contract. After such a cancellation, the contract buyer or the contract buyer's estate shall receive a refund in accordance with subsection (1) or (2) within 30 days after receipt by the contract seller or the provider of a request for payment from the contract buyer or the contract buyer's estate. Contracts may be upgraded after the death of the contract beneficiary by a person on behalf of the contract beneficiary's estate or by a person entitled to make funeral or cemetery arrangements. This subsection does not prevent the transfer of a contract from 1 provider to another provider upon the request of those entitled to make funeral arrangements.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Prior to the death of the contract beneficiary and in the case of a prepaid contract or multiple prepaid contracts containing any of the merchandise or services escrowed under section 12(1) together with cemetery merchandise escrowed under section 12(2), the buyer may cancel that portion of the contract pertaining to the cemetery merchandise alone, without canceling the remaining portions. Such cancellation is subject to refund pursuant to section 13(2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A contract seller or a provider that assigns or transfers its obligations under a prepaid contract to another provider shall notify the contract buyer of the assignment in writing. If the contract buyer cancels the contract within 30 days of the notification of the assignment, the buyer shall be entitled to a refund of 100% of the remaining principal and income plus the commission, if any, charged in accordance with section 12(1) or (2). An assignment or transfer of a provider's obligations under a prepaid contract that is made in connection with the sale of a business is subject to this subsection only if more than 50% of the ownership interest in the business is transferred to another person or persons within a 12-month period. Upon sale of the business, the notice requirement of this subsection is the responsibility of the purchaser. This subsection does not apply to an assignment of a financial interest in an installment contract to a financial institution. At the time that the contract seller or provider receives payment in exchange for selling or assigning its financial interest in an installment contract to a financial institution, the contract seller or provider shall be required to place in escrow the amount required by this act. This subsection does not apply to burial rights or other land interests, crypts, inscribed grave memorials, or niches, for which no refunds are available.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   All prices or quotations of prices contained in a prepaid contract, offer, or solicitation shall be stated in compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. In addition, a person who offers either merchandise or funeral or cemetery services on a preneed or at-need basis shall comply with the price disclosure rules of the federal trade commission, code of federal regulations, 16 C.F.R., part 453, whether or not the rules by their own terms apply to the offering. This subsection does not apply to the sale of any interest covered by the endowment care trust requirements of the cemetery regulation act, 1968 PA 251, MCL 456.521 to 456.543.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A person who sells or offers to sell both funeral goods or services and nonfuneral goods or services as part of the same transaction or series of transactions shall not manipulate the relative prices of the goods or services so as to allocate a disproportionate share of the total price to nonfuneral property or services.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   All prepaid contracts shall provide that a contract buyer may revoke the prepaid contract within 10 business days after entering into the prepaid contract and that upon revocation, all funds paid to the contract seller or provider shall be refunded. This provision shall be conspicuously set forth in the prepaid contract at a place immediately before the place where the contract buyer is to sign his or her name.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A prepaid contract shall disclose the contract buyer's right to cancel the prepaid contract and the amount of the refund to which the contract buyer or that person's estate is entitled upon cancellation. The disclosure shall be stated substantially as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   “This contract may be canceled either before death or after death by the buyer or, if the buyer is deceased, by the person or persons legally authorized to make funeral or cemetery arrangements. If the contract is canceled, the buyer or the buyer's estate is entitled to receive a refund of ____% of the contract price and any income as required by law.”</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In addition, if a commission is charged pursuant to section 12, the amount of the commission and the fact that it is a charge which is in addition to the contract price shall be stated in the prepaid funeral contract. If a printed contract form is used, the disclosures required by this subsection shall be stated in boldfaced type.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   This act does not authorize a contract seller or provider to perform or offer to perform services for which a mortuary science license or funeral establishment licensed is required by article 18 of the occupational code, 1980 PA 299, MCL 339.1801 to 339.1812, unless that person holds the required license or licenses and does not require a contract seller or a provider to possess this license or any other license to engage in an activity covered under this act for which a license is not required by any other act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A prepaid contract shall provide that the contract buyer may designate a new contract beneficiary any time before the death of the contract beneficiary originally specified in the prepaid contract by providing written notice to the contract seller of a nonguaranteed price contract or the provider designated to furnish merchandise or funeral or cemetery services pursuant to a guaranteed price contract. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, a contract buyer may designate the estate of a deceased person as the contract beneficiary, or provide that the contract beneficiary is the first of 2 or more designated persons to die.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A prepaid contract that is a nonguaranteed price contract shall have it indicated clearly on the prepaid contract that it is a nonguaranteed price contract and that the actual costs of the merchandise or funeral or cemetery services delivered at the time of death may be greater or less than the amount of principal and income in the escrow account, and that the buyer, the buyer's estate, or the person or persons legally entitled to make funeral or cemetery arrangements, or both, are not obligated to purchase specific merchandise and services which were selected before the death of the contract beneficiary or to expend a specific amount on merchandise or funeral or cemetery services.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 19.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A prepaid contract may be made with an applicant for or recipient of assistance under the social welfare act, 1939 PA 280, MCL 400.1 to 400.119b, or a patient or a legal guardian of a patient in a community health care facility under the jurisdiction of the department of community health. If the family independence agency or department of community health determines that the contract is a fully paid guaranteed price contract, and that the proceeds of the contract and the amount of any death benefit from an insurance policy or annuity contract that has been assigned pursuant to section 2080(6) of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.2080, as payment for merchandise or funeral or cemetery services for the contract beneficiary are not more than that amount allowed under section 2080(6)(g) of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.2080, plus $2,000.00, exclusive of income, and that the state will not be liable for the merchandise or funeral or cemetery services, excluding an outside receptacle when required by the chosen cemetery, of the applicant for or recipient of assistance or patient allowable under contracts under this act, the prepaid contract shall be made irrevocable at the request of the applicant for or recipient of assistance, or the patient or a legal guardian of a patient. Nothing in this section shall be construed as increasing the amount of excludable burial assets for family independence agency or medicaid program eligibility above that allowed under existing family independence agency standards, including any increases in those standards. The family independence agency or department of community health shall advise the applicant for or recipient of assistance, or the patient or a legal guardian of a patient that additional merchandise or funeral or cemetery services subject to contract under this act will not be paid by the family independence agency or department of community health but shall not specify or require approval of particular merchandise or funeral or cemetery services selected by the applicant for or recipient of assistance, or patient or a legal guardian of a patient.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A prepaid contract approved by the family independence agency or department of community health shall not be revoked or canceled by the contract seller, contract provider, contract buyer, or their successors, or the estate of the contract beneficiary either before or after the death of the contract beneficiary. This subsection does not prevent those legally entitled to make arrangements for a contract beneficiary from reallocating the amount paid under the prepaid contract to different funeral or cemetery services and merchandise. A contract seller or provider shall assign an irrevocable prepaid contract to another provider upon the written request of the contract beneficiary, his or her successor, or those legally entitled to make arrangements for the contract beneficiary so long as the written request is received before a provider's obligations have been performed. An irrevocable contract shall not be considered in determining the eligibility of an applicant or recipient for assistance given under the social welfare act, 1939 PA 280, MCL 400.1 to 400.119b. An irrevocable prepaid contract made under this section is not subject to the cancellation provision of section 13 or to the provisions of section 15(6).</DIV>
