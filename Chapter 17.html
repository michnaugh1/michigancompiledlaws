The Court of Appeals conferred standing and held that the statutory authority relied upon by the board had been impliedly repealed by subsequent legislative acts. The Michigan Supreme Court agreed that the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee had standing, but reversed the Court of Appeals decision repealing the State Administrative Board's authority to transfer funds. The Michigan Supreme Court held that neither subsequent amendments to the State Administrative Board Act nor the enactment of the Management and Budget Act indicates an intent by the legislature to repeal by implication the Board's authority under MCL 17.3 to transfer funds within a department.

</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, Article V, Section 2 of the Constitution of the state of Michigan of 1963 empowers the Governor to make changes in the organization of the Executive Branch or in the assignment of functions among its units which he considers necessary for efficient administration; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, Executive Order No. 1999-12 transferred the day-to-day administrative powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities under the Perkins Act to the Department of Career Development; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, the purpose of the Carl D.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, although the 1998 amendments to the federal Perkins Act intended to provide states more flexibility in assigning Perkins-related administration to an eligible state entity, the United States Department of Education still adheres to the policy that oversight responsibility must be administered by a board; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, the State Administrative Board was created by Act No. 2 of the Public Acts of 1921, as amended, being Sections 17.1 et seq. of the Michigan Compiled Laws, and is composed of the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, Superintendent of Public Instruction, and State Treasurer; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, the State Administrative Board exercises general supervisory control over the functions and activities of all administrative departments, boards, commissioners and officers of the state and its institutions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>NOW, THEREFORE, I, John Engler, Governor of the state of Michigan, pursuant to the powers vested in me by the Constitution of the state of Michigan of 1963 and the laws of the state of Michigan, do hereby order the following: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>I. TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>All of the administrative statutory powers, duties, functions and responsibilities of the Department of Career Development to administer the Carl D.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>III. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>A. Nothing in this Executive Order should be construed to diminish the constitutional authority of the State Board of Education to provide leadership and general supervision over all public education, including adult education and instructional programs in state institutions, except as to institutions of higher education granting baccalaureate degrees, and its authority to serve as the general planning and coordinating body for all public education including higher education, and to advise the legislature as to the financial requirements in connection therewith.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>B. The Director of the Department of Career Development and the Chairperson of the State Administrative Board shall provide executive direction and supervision for the implementation of the transferred functions in such ways as to promote efficient administration and shall make internal organizational changes as may be administratively necessary to complete the realignment of responsibilities prescribed by this Order.</div>
