<P>Sec. 6a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Subject to subsection (3), beginning on the effective date of the amendatory act that added this section, the administrator shall approve or reject a new or renewal license application within 90 days after the date a complete application under section 4 is received by the office of financial and insurance services or the date it is received by another agency or department of state government on behalf of the office of financial and insurance services, whichever is earlier.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If an application described in subsection (1) is considered incomplete by the administrator, the administrator shall notify the applicant in writing or electronically within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information, the unpaid fee, or the bond. The 90-day time period described in subsection (1) is tolled upon notification by the administrator of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the administrator. The determination of the completeness of an application does not operate as an approval of the application for the license and does not confer eligibility of an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license. The tolling of the 90-day time period under this subsection does not allow the administrator to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and that application, upon completion, shall be placed in sequence with other complete applications received at that same time.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the administrator fails to issue or deny a license within the time required by this section, the administrator shall return the license fee and shall reduce the license fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. The administrator shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based upon the fact that the license fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Beginning October 1, 2005, the administrator shall submit a report by December 1 of each year to the standing committees of the senate and house of representatives concerned with commerce issues and to the appropriations subcommittees of the senate and house of representatives generally responsible for appropriations to the office of financial and insurance services. The administrator shall include all of the following information in the report concerning the preceding fiscal year:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The number of initial and renewal applications the administrator received and completed within the 90-day time period described in subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The number of applications denied.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Upon approving a license application, the administrator shall issue to the applicant a license certificate showing the name of the person authorized to do business under the license and the business address of the licensee. Upon issuance to a licensee, a license certificate shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the place of business of the licensee in full view of the public at all times.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A license shall not be transferable or assignable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A licensee may change his or her place of business to another location within the same municipality for which the license certificate was issued. A licensee desiring to change the address of his or her place of business shall give prior written notice to the administrator and shall return the license certificate to the administrator for amendment. The administrator shall amend the license certificate to show the new address and the date of the change, which shall then be the authorized address of the licensee. A licensee shall pay a fee of $10.00 to amend a license certificate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Only 1 place of business may be operated under the same license. A licensee may operate more than 1 place of business by filing an application on the prescribed form for each additional place of business and complying with the bond and license fee provisions of this act.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;1.   The licensee has made any material misstatement in the application for license, or that</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.   The licensee has violated any provisions of this act, or that</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;3.   The licensee refuses or has refused to permit the administrator or his designated representative to make examinations authorized by this act, or that</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;4.   The licensee in the case of a sales finance company has failed to maintain in effect the bond required under the provisions of this act, or that</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;5.   The licensee has failed to maintain satisfactory records required by this act, or that</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;6.   The licensee has falsified any records required by this act to be maintained in connection with the business contemplated by this act, or that</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;7.   The licensee has after proper notice failed to file any report with the administrator within the time stipulated in this act, or that</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;8.   The licensee has failed to pay the fine required by this act for failure to file reports to the administrator within the time stipulated, or that</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;9.   The licensee has defrauded any retail buyer to the buyer's damage or wilfully failed to perform any written agreement with any retail buyer, or that</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;10.   Any fact or condition exists or is discovered which, if it had existed or had been discovered at the time of filing of the application for such license, would have warranted the administrator in refusing to issue such license.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The administrator may revoke or suspend only the particular license with respect to which grounds for revocation may occur or exist, but if he finds that grounds for revocation are of general application to all places of business or to more than 1 place of business operated by a licensee, he may revoke all of the licenses issued to such licensee or those licenses to which grounds for revocation apply, as the case may be.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Whenever a license has been revoked, the administrator shall not issue another license to the licensee pursuant to the provisions of this act until the expiration of at least 1 year from the effective date of revocation of said license.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Appeals may be taken from the action of the administrator in accordance with procedure prescribed in section 30 of Act No. 319 of the Public Acts of 1969, being section 487.330 of the Compiled Laws of 1948.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 16.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The buyer of a motor vehicle under an installment sale contract may be required to provide insurance on such motor vehicle at the buyer's expense for the protection of the seller or subsequent holder. Such insurance shall be limited to insurance against substantial risk of damage, destruction or theft of such motor vehicle: Provided, however, That the foregoing shall not interfere with the liberty of contract of the buyer and seller to contract for travel emergency benefits pertaining to the operation of the automobile or other or additional insurance as security for or by reason of the obligation of the buyer, and inclusion of the cost of such insurance premium and said travel emergency benefits in the principal amount advanced under the installment sale contract. Such insurance shall, if possible to obtain, be written for the dual protection of the buyer and of the seller, or subsequent holder, to the extent of his interest in the motor vehicle. Such insurance shall be for an amount, and period of time, and upon terms and conditions, which are reasonable and appropriate considering the type and condition of the motor vehicle, the amount of the time balance and the schedule of payments in the installment sale contract. In the event such insurance cannot be obtained for the dual protection of the buyer and the seller, or subsequent holder, or if obtained, is cancelled by the insurance company prior to expiration, the seller, or subsequent holder, may obtain insurance to protect his interest in the motor vehicle and the buyer may be required to pay the cost thereof. In such event, the seller, or subsequent holder, shall promptly notify the buyer that such insurance cannot be obtained, or is cancelled, and credit to the buyer the difference between the amount charged by the seller for such dual protection insurance and the cost to the seller of such single interest insurance (less, in the event of cancellation, the earned premium on the dual interest insurance for the period it is in force): Provided, That whenever such insurance is written for the protection of the seller, or subsequent holder, only, neither the insurance company issuing the policy nor any other person shall be subrogated to the rights of the insured as against the buyer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The buyer of a motor vehicle under an installment sale contract shall have the privilege of purchasing such insurance from any insurance company, agent or broker authorized to do business in Michigan other than the installment seller. No installment seller shall coerce, threaten, or in any manner influence any installment buyer to purchase insurance from any insurance company, agent or broker designated by such seller: Provided, however, That the inclusion of the cost of the insurance premium in the installment sale contract, when the buyer selects the company, agent or broker, shall be optional with the seller.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Whenever the seller contracts to purchase, at the buyer's expense, such insurance on a motor vehicle sold under an installment sale contract, such insurance shall be purchased through an agent and/or broker or other person, authorized to conduct business in Michigan, and such insurance shall be written by an insurance company qualified to do business in Michigan. The status of the buyer and seller or holder, as set forth in such insurance contract, shall conform to the status of these parties in the installment sale contract. The cost of the premium on such insurance to the buyer shall not be in excess of the amount of the premium which others are required to pay to such insurance company for similar coverage, and in no event in excess of rates established in the then current published applicable manual of a recognized standard insurance rating bureau, or the rates fixed by authority of the state of Michigan.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Whenever the seller contracts to purchase, at the buyer's expense, such insurance on a motor vehicle sold under an installment sale contract, a certificate of insurance and a statement showing itemized cost of such insurance shall be delivered to the buyer within 25 days of the date of the buyer's signing of the installment sale contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The insurance policy or certificate of insurance on the motor vehicle which is furnished to the buyer, when the insurance is placed by the seller or subsequent holder at the buyer's expense, shall set forth complete information as to the effective dates, amounts of premiums and coverage, and shall contain all the terms of the insurance contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   When the seller or subsequent holder has placed, at the expense of the buyer, insurance on a motor vehicle sold under an installment sale contract and the buyer prepays the time balance under the contract prior to the expiration date of the insurance, such insurance shall remain in force unless the buyer requests cancellation thereof. The seller or holder shall not cancel the insurance under such circumstances without the buyer's consent, nor shall the seller or holder coerce the buyer to cancel the insurance. Unexpired insurance premiums received by the seller or holder, resulting from cancellation of insurance which was originally placed at the buyer's expense, shall be used in procuring comparable insurance as in subsection (g) of this section provided, and if such insurance cannot be obtained, shall be paid to the buyer or credited to any matured unpaid installments under the contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   When the seller contracts to purchase insurance at the buyer's expense and such insurance is cancelled by the insurance company prior to expiration, the seller or subsequent holder shall attempt to place comparable insurance with another insurance company and furnish or cause to be furnished to the buyer a copy of the insurance policy or certificate of insurance, subject to the same requirements of this act applicable to the original policy. In the event the holder is unable to obtain such insurance in another insurance company, he shall promptly notify the buyer by registered mail, addressed to the buyer at the address appearing upon the installment sale contract, unless the seller is in receipt of written notice of a change in the buyer's address, and in such event addressed to the buyer at such changed address. The buyer may then obtain such insurance from an insurance company, agent or broker of his own selection. The holder shall also be liable to the buyer for any loss suffered by the buyer through negligence on the part of the holder in promptly mailing notice to the buyer of his inability to obtain replacement insurance.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The seller of a motor vehicle under an installment sale contract may also contract with the buyer to pay, on behalf of the buyer, such other costs incidental to the sale of a motor vehicle and contracted for voluntarily by the buyer as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>1. Fees in amounts established by and paid to the state of Michigan for titling and registration of the motor vehicle and issuance or transfer of registration plates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>2. If the buyer of a motor vehicle elects to title or register the motor vehicle electronically, fees payable to any third party authorized by the secretary of state and to the seller for electronic titling and registration of the motor vehicle.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Such other costs paid or payable by the buyer shall not exceed the amount which the seller expends or intends to expend therefor. Any such costs which the seller has collected from the buyer, or which have been included in the buyer's obligation under the installment sale contract which are not disbursed by the seller, as contemplated, shall be immediately refunded or credited to the buyer.</div>

If an installment sale contract provides for payment other than in equal successive weekly, semimonthly, or monthly installments, the finance charge may be at a rate that will provide the same annual percentage rate as is permitted on monthly payment contracts considering the schedule of payments in the contract. The seller shall disclose the annual percentage rate of the installment sales contract in accordance with disclosure requirements of the truth in lending act, title I of the consumer credit protection act, Public Law 90-321, 15 U.S.C. 1601 to 1608, 1610 to 1613, 1615, 1631 to 1635, 1637 to 1648, and 1661 to 1667e, and the regulations promulgated under the truth in lending act.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The holder of an installment sale contract may extend the scheduled due date, defer a payment or payments, or renew the unpaid time balance of the contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The holder may contract for, receive, and collect a refinance charge for the extension, deferment, or renewal. The refinance charge shall not exceed the amount ascertained under the rates allowed by section 18(a).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If 1 or more installment payments are extended or deferred, computing the refinance charge on the amount of the installment payment or payments or part of a payment that is refinanced, for the period of time for which each payment or part of a payment is extended or deferred, shall not exceed rates provided for in section 18(a).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The refinance charges may be computed on the basis of a full month for any fractional month period in excess of 10 days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   If the unpaid balance of the contract is refinanced or renewed, a refinance charge may be assessed on the amount obtained by adding to the unpaid time balance of the contract the insurance cost and other costs incidental to refinancing and the unpaid default charges that may be accrued, and by deducting any rebate that may be due to the buyer for prepayment incidental to refinancing, at the rate of the finance charge provided for in section 18(a), but otherwise subject to the provisions of this act governing computation of the original finance charge.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The holder of an installment sale contract shall not include in any contract for refinancing the contract any cash loan to the buyer, nor any credit extended to the buyer incidental to the purchase of goods or services. A loan under this section does not include, nor does this act prohibit, a rearrangement of payments under the installment sale contract by a refinance transaction involving a restoration of certain installment payments made under the contract, but the refinance charge on the amount restored may not be more than that specified in section 18(a). The holder of the contract may embody in the refinance contract the cost of accessories, equipment, and parts for the motor vehicle sold under the contract, and the cost of repairs and services to the motor vehicle including finance charges on the contract.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Instead of a finance charge computed on the principal amount financed, the seller may charge from time to time a finance charge consisting of interest on the amount of the unpaid principal balance of the contract. In this event, the transaction is subject to this act as modified by the following provisions:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The number and amount of installment payments required to be stated pursuant to section 13 may be estimated for purposes of this section assuming that each scheduled payment is made on the date it is due and in the scheduled amount.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The holder of the contract has the option of deferring interest charges which accrue due to installment payments being received later than the periodic installment due date. The deferred interest charge shall be computed on the basis of additional interest charges accruing for late installment payments and appropriate interest reductions for installment payments made before the due date. On contracts providing for equal monthly installments, if the final installment is more than 105% of a previous installment as a result of the deferred interest charges, the installment buyer shall be given the option to pay the deferred interest charges not less than 25 days after the date the last installment payment is due.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If the unpaid time balance is prepaid in full, together with all interest incurred to the date of prepayment, the balance of the original finance charge shall be canceled and the finance charge rebate provisions of section 21 do not apply.</DIV>
