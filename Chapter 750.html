<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) Except as provided in subsection (20), an animal that has been used to fight in violation of this section or that is involved in a violation of subsections (8) to (14) must be confiscated by a law enforcement officer and must not be returned to the owner, trainer, or possessor of the animal. The animal must be taken to a local animal control agency. If an animal owner, trainer, or possessor is convicted of violating subsection (2) or subsections (8) to (14), the court shall award the animal involved in the violation to the animal control agency for evaluation and disposition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) An animal control agency taking custody of an animal under subsection (16) shall give notice within 72 hours after seizure of the animal by registered mail to the last known address of the animal's owner, if the owner of the animal is known. If the owner of the animal is unknown, an animal control agency taking custody of an animal under subsection (16) shall give notice within 72 hours after seizure of the animal by 1 of the following methods:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A statement that the owner or possessor of the animal may post a security deposit or bond that may prevent the forfeiture of the animal for the duration of the criminal, forfeiture, or other court proceeding until the court makes a final determination regarding the animal's disposition, that failure to post a security deposit or bond within 14 days after the date on the notice will result in forfeiture of the animal, and that the owner or possessor of the animal may, before the expiration of the 14-day period described in this subdivision, request a hearing on whether the requirement to post a security deposit or bond is justified or whether the cost associated with the security deposit or bond is fair and reasonable for the care of and provision for the seized animal. Notice of a request for a hearing under this subdivision must be served on the animal control agency holding the animal before the expiration of the 14-day period described in this subdivision. At a hearing on whether the requirement to post a security deposit or bond is justified, the prosecuting attorney has the burden to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation of this section occurred. If the court finds that the prosecuting attorney has met its burden, the animal will be forfeited to the animal control agency that seized the animal unless the owner or possessor of the animal posts the required security deposit or bond. An owner or possessor's failure to appear at a scheduled hearing requested under this subdivision will result in automatic forfeiture of the animal if the date of the scheduled hearing is more than 14 days after the date on the notice described in this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A statement that the owner or possessor of the animal is responsible for all costs described in subsection (6), unless the court determines that the seizure of the animal was not substantially justified by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) An animal control agency that has custody of a seized animal under subsection (16) shall hold the animal for a period of 14 consecutive days, including weekends and holidays, beginning on the date notice was given under subsection (17). After the expiration of the 14 days, if the owner or a possessor of the animal has not posted a security deposit or bond as provided in subsection (20), the animal is forfeited, and the animal control agency may dispose of the animal by adoption, transfer to another animal control agency, or humane euthanasia.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) The owner or possessor of an animal seized under subsection (16) may prevent forfeiture and disposition of the animal by an animal control agency for the duration of the criminal, forfeiture, or other court proceeding until the court makes a final determination regarding the animal's disposition by posting a security deposit or bond with the court within 14 days after the date on the notice described in subsection (18). The bond must be in a sufficient amount to secure payment of all costs described in subsection (6) during a 30-day period of boarding and veterinary treatment of the animal after examination by a licensed veterinarian. The animal control agency shall determine the amount of the bond no later than 72 hours after the seizure of the animal, and shall make the amount of the bond available to the owner or possessor of the animal upon request. The owner or possessor of the animal shall provide proof of the security deposit or bond to the animal control agency no later than 14 days after the date on the notice described in subsection (18).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) An animal control agency that is holding or requiring to be held a seized animal as provided in this section may draw on a security deposit or bond posted under subsection (20) or (22) to cover the actual reasonable costs incurred in the seizure, care, keeping, and disposition of the animal as described in subsection (6) from the date of the seizure to the date of the official disposition of the animal in the criminal action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) If a security deposit or bond has been posted under subsection (20), and trial in the criminal action does not occur within the initial 30-day bond period or is continued to a later date, the owner or possessor shall post an additional security deposit or bond in an amount determined sufficient to cover the costs described in subsection (6) as anticipated to be incurred by the animal control agency caring for the animal. The additional security deposit or bond must be calculated in 30-day increments and continue until the criminal action is resolved. If the owner or possessor of the animal fails to post a new security deposit or bond with the court before the previous security deposit or bond expires, the animal is forfeited to the animal control agency caring for the animal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(23) If the owner or possessor that posted a security deposit or bond under subsection (20) or (22) is found not guilty in the criminal action, the amount of the security deposit or bond posted to prevent disposition of the animal may be returned to the owner or possessor at the court's discretion, and, subject to subsections (25) and (26), the animal must be returned to the owner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(24) If a security deposit or bond is posted by an owner or possessor of an animal under subsection (20) or (22) and the court determines that the animal is a dangerous animal or lacks any useful purpose under subsection (26), the posting of the security deposit or bond must not prevent disposition of the animal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(25) Upon receiving an animal seized under this section, or at any time thereafter, an animal control agency may humanely euthanize the animal or have the animal euthanized if, in the opinion of a licensed veterinarian, the animal is injured or diseased past recovery or the animal's continued existence is inhumane so that euthanasia is necessary to relieve pain and suffering. This subsection applies to an animal whether or not a security deposit or bond has been posted under subsection (20) or (22).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(26) An animal control agency that receives an animal under this section may apply to the district court or municipal court for a hearing to determine whether the animal must be humanely euthanized because of its lack of any useful purpose or the public safety threat it poses. The court shall hold a hearing not more than 30 days after the filing of the application and shall give notice of the hearing to the owner of the animal. Upon a finding by the court that the animal lacks any useful purpose or poses a threat to public safety, the animal control agency shall humanely euthanize the animal or have the animal euthanized. Expenses incurred in connection with the housing, care, upkeep, or euthanasia of the animal by an animal control agency, or by a person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other entity, may, in the court's discretion, be assessed against the owner of the animal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(27) Subject to subsections (16), (25), and (26), all animals being used or to be used in fighting, equipment, devices, and money involved in a violation of subsection (2) must be forfeited to this state. All other instrumentalities, proceeds, and substituted proceeds of a violation of subsection (2) are subject to forfeiture under chapter 47 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.4701 to 600.4710.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(28) The seizing agency may deposit money seized under subsection (27) into an interest-bearing account in a financial institution. As used in this subsection, "financial institution" means a state or nationally chartered bank or a state or federally chartered savings and loan association, savings bank, or credit union whose deposits are insured by an agency of the United States government and that maintains a principal office or branch office located in this state under the laws of this state or the United States.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(29) An attorney for a person who is charged with a violation of subsection (2) involving or related to money seized under subsection (27) must be afforded a period of 60 days within which to examine that money. This 60-day period will begin to run after notice of forfeiture is given but before the money is deposited into a financial institution under subsection (28). If the attorney general, prosecuting attorney, or city or township attorney fails to sustain his or her burden of proof in forfeiture proceedings under subsection (27), the court shall order the return of the money, including any interest earned on money deposited into a financial institution under subsection (28).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(30) This section does not apply to conduct that is permitted by and is in compliance with any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Part 401 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.40101 to 324.40120.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Part 417 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.41701 to 324.41712.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(31) This section does not prohibit a person from being charged with, convicted of, or punished for any other violation of law that is committed by that person while violating this section.</div>

If cash or other security has been submitted, and the trial in the action is continued at a later date, any order of continuance must require the defendant to submit additional cash or security in an amount determined by the court to be sufficient to repay all additional reasonable costs anticipated to be incurred by the animal control shelter or animal protection shelter or the licensed veterinarian in caring for the animal until the new date of trial. If the defendant submits cash or other security to the court under this subsection the court may enter an order authorizing the use of that cash or other security before final disposition of the criminal charges to pay the reasonable costs incurred by the animal control shelter or animal protection shelter or the licensed veterinarian in caring for the animal from the date of impoundment to the date of final disposition of the criminal charges. The testimony of a person at a hearing held under this subsection is not admissible against him or her in any criminal proceeding except in a criminal prosecution for perjury. The testimony of a person at a hearing held under this subsection does not waive the person's constitutional right against self-incrimination. An animal seized under this section or section 50b is not subject to any other civil action pending the final judgment of the forfeiture action under this subsection.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Upon the entry of the order of criminal forfeiture pursuant to section 159j, the court shall cause notice of the order to be sent by certified mail to all persons known to have, or appearing to have, an interest in the property to be forfeited. To assist the court in determining whom to notify, the prosecuting agency shall conduct a search of county, state, and federal public records where notice of liens and security interests are normally recorded. If the name and address of the person are not reasonably ascertainable or delivery of the notice cannot reasonably be accomplished, the notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the prosecution occurred for 10 successive publishing days. Proof of written notice or publication shall be filed with the court entering the order of criminal forfeiture.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Within 21 days after receipt of the notice or after the date of the completion of the publication under subsection (1), a person, other than the defendant, who claims an interest in the property subject to criminal forfeiture may petition the court for a hearing to determine the validity of the claim. The petition shall be signed and sworn to by the petitioner and shall set forth the nature and extent of the petitioner's interest in the property, the date and circumstances of the petitioner's acquisition of the interest, any additional allegations supporting the claim, and the relief sought. The petitioner shall furnish the prosecuting agency with a copy of the petition.</DIV>

The prosecuting agency may present evidence and witnesses in rebuttal and in defense of the claim of the state to the property and may cross-examine witnesses. The court, in making its determination, shall consider the testimony and evidence presented at the hearing and the relevant portions of the record of the criminal proceeding that resulted in the order of criminal forfeiture.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The petitioner has a legal right, title, or interest in the property that, at the time of the commission of the acts giving rise to the forfeiture of the property, was vested in the petitioner and not in the defendant or was superior to the right, title, or interest of the defendant, and the petitioner did not have prior actual knowledge of the racketeering activity.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The petitioner is a bona fide purchaser for value of the right, title, or interest in the property and was at the time of the purchase reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture under section 159j.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The property is encumbered by a security interest and the holder of the security interest did not have prior actual knowledge of the racketeering activity.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 159n.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A civil in rem forfeiture proceeding under this chapter is a proceeding against property subject to forfeiture under section 159m instituted by the filing of a petition by the prosecuting agency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Personal or intangible property subject to civil in rem forfeiture under section 159m may be seized pursuant to an order of seizure issued by the court having jurisdiction over the property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Upon an ex parte application by the prosecuting agency, before or after the initiation of a civil in rem forfeiture proceeding, the court may determine ex parte whether there is probable cause to believe that personal or intangible property is subject to civil in rem forfeiture under section 159m and that notice to those persons having or claiming an interest in the property before seizure would cause the loss or destruction of the property. In making this determination, the court shall, as a matter of law, make a determination that the property constituted an interest in, means of control over, or influence over an enterprise involved in a violation of section 159i. If the court finds that probable cause does not exist to believe the property is subject to forfeiture under this act, the court shall dismiss the plaintiff prosecuting agency's application and, if a civil in rem forfeiture proceeding has been initiated, shall dismiss the petition. If the court finds that probable cause does exist to believe the property is subject to forfeiture but there is not probable cause to believe that prior notice would result in loss or destruction of the property, the court shall order service on all persons known to have or claim an interest in the property before a further hearing on whether an order of seizure should issue. If the court finds that there is probable cause to believe that the property is subject to forfeiture and to believe that prior notice would cause loss or destruction of the property, the court shall issue an order of seizure directing the sheriff or other law enforcement officer in the county where the property is found to seize it.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Personal or intangible property subject to civil in rem forfeiture under this chapter may be seized without process under any of the following circumstances:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The seizure is incident to a lawful arrest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The seizure is pursuant to a valid search warrant.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The seizure is pursuant to an inspection under a valid administrative inspection warrant.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   There is probable cause to believe that the property is directly or indirectly dangerous to health or safety.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Exigent circumstances exist that preclude the obtaining of a court order, and there is probable cause to believe that the property is subject to civil in rem forfeiture under section 159m.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The property is the subject of a prior judgment in favor of this state in a forfeiture proceeding.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The prosecuting agency may apply ex parte for an order authorizing the filing of a lien notice against real property subject to civil in rem forfeiture under section 159m. The application shall be supported by a sworn affidavit setting forth probable cause for a civil in rem forfeiture action pursuant to sections 159m to 159q. An order authorizing the filing of a lien notice may be issued upon a showing of probable cause to believe that the property is subject to civil in rem forfeiture under section 159m.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Real property shall not be seized without notice and a hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Property that belongs to the victim of a crime shall promptly be returned to the victim, except in the following circumstances:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The property is contraband.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the ownership of the property is disputed, until the dispute is resolved.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The property is required to be retained as evidence pursuant to section 4(4) of the crime victim's rights act, Act No. 87 of the Public Acts of 1985, being section 780.754 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Personal or intangible property seized under this section is not subject to any other action to recover personal property, but is considered to be in the custody of the seizing agency subject only to this chapter, or to an order and judgment of the court having jurisdiction over the civil in rem forfeiture proceedings. When property is seized under this section, the seizing agency may do 1 or more of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Place the property under seal.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Remove the property to a place designated by the court.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A person who deserts and abandons his or her spouse or deserts and abandons his or her children under 17 years of age, without providing necessary and proper shelter, food, care, and clothing for them, and a person who being of sufficient ability fails, neglects, or refuses to provide necessary and proper shelter, food, care, and clothing for his or her spouse or his or her children under 17 years of age, is guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment in a state correctional facility for not less than 1 year and not more than 3 years, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not less than 3 months and not more than 1 year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If at any time before sentence the defendant enters into bond to the people of the state of Michigan in such penal sum for such term and with such surety or sureties as may be fixed by the court, conditioned that he or she will furnish his or her spouse and children with necessary and proper shelter, food, care, and clothing, or will pay to the clerk of the court, or other designated person, such sums of money at such times as the court shall order to be used to provide food, shelter, and clothing for his or her spouse and children, or either of them, then the court may make an order placing the defendant in charge of a probation officer. The court may require that the defendant shall from time to time report to the probation officer as provided by law. The court may extend the period of probation from time to time or the court may defer sentence in the cause, but no term of any bond or any probation period shall exceed the maximum term of imprisonment as provided for in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Upon failure of the defendant to comply with any of the conditions contained in the bond, the defendant may be ordered to appear before the court and show cause why sentence should not be imposed, whereupon the court may pass sentence, or for good cause shown may modify the order and further defer sentence as may be just and proper.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the court orders an individual to pay support for the individual's former or current spouse, or for a child of the individual, and the individual does not pay the support in the amount or at the time stated in the order, the individual is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 4 years or by a fine of not more than $2,000.00, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) This section does not apply unless the court in which the support order was issued had personal jurisdiction over the individual ordered to pay support. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Unless the individual deposits a cash bond of not less than $500.00 or 25% of the arrearage, whichever is greater, upon arrest for a violation of this section, the individual shall remain in custody until the arraignment. If the individual remains in custody, the court shall address the amount of the cash bond at the arraignment and at the preliminary examination and, except for good cause shown on the record, shall order the bond to be continued at not less than $500.00 or 25% of the arrearage, whichever is greater. At the court's discretion, the court may set the cash bond at an amount not more than 100% of the arrearage and add to that amount the amount of the costs that the court may require under section 31(3) of the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.631. The court shall specify that the cash bond amount be entered into the law enforcement information network.

At a minimum, the bond must be conditioned on the individual's compliance with the support order. If the court suspends a sentence under this subsection and the individual does not comply with the support order or another condition on the bond, the court may order the individual to appear and show cause why the court should not impose the sentence and enforce the bond. After the hearing, the court may enforce the bond or impose the sentence, or both, or may permit the filing of a new bond and again suspend the sentence. The court shall order a support amount enforced under this section to be paid to the clerk or friend of the court or to the state disbursement unit.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 227g.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person who has been convicted of a violent felony shall not purchase, own, possess, or use body armor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A person who has been convicted of a violent felony whose employment, livelihood, or safety is dependent on his or her ability to purchase, own, possess, or use body armor may petition the chief of police of the local unit of government in which he or she resides or, if he or she does not reside in a local unit of government that has a police department, the county sheriff, for written permission to purchase, own, possess, or use body armor under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The chief of police of a local unit of government or the county sheriff may grant a person who properly petitions that chief of police or county sheriff under subsection (2) written permission to purchase, own, possess, or use body armor as provided in this section if the chief of police or county sheriff determines that both of the following circumstances exist:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The petitioner is likely to use body armor in a safe and lawful manner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The petitioner has reasonable need for the protection provided by body armor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In making the determination required under subsection (3), the chief of police or county sheriff shall consider all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The petitioner's continued employment.</DIV>

If permission is restricted, the chief of police or county sheriff shall state the restrictions in the permission document.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   It is the intent of the legislature that chiefs of police and county sheriffs exercise broad discretion in determining whether to issue written permission to purchase, own, possess, or use body armor under this section. However, nothing in this section requires a chief of police or county sheriff to issue written permission to any particular petitioner. The issuance of written permission to purchase, own, possess, or use body armor under this section does not relieve any person or entity from criminal liability that might otherwise be imposed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A person who receives written permission from a chief of police or county sheriff to purchase, own, possess, or use body armor shall have that written permission in his or her possession when he or she is purchasing, owning, possessing, or using body armor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   A law enforcement agency may issue body armor to a person who is in custody or who is a witness to a crime for his or her own protection without a petition being previously filed under subsection (2). If the law enforcement agency issues body armor to the person under this subsection, the law enforcement agency shall document the reasons for issuing body armor and retain a copy of that document as an official record. The law enforcement agency shall also issue written permission to the person to possess and use body armor under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   A person who violates this section is guilty of a crime as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   For a violation of subsection (1), the person is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 4 years or a fine of not more than $2,000.00, or both.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   As used in this section:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Body armor" means that term as defined in section 227f.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person who for hire, gain, or reward, keeps or maintains a gaming room, gaming table, game of skill or chance, or game partly of skill and partly of chance, used for gaming, or who permits a gaming room, or gaming table, or game to be kept, maintained, or played on premises occupied or controlled by the person, is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 2 years, or a fine of not more than $1,000.00. A person who aids, assists, or abets in the keeping or maintaining of a gaming room, gaming table, or game, is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 2 years, or a fine of not more than $1,000.00.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Subsection (1) does not apply to a mechanical amusement device which may, through the application of an element of skill, reward the player with the right to replay the mechanical amusement device at no additional cost if the mechanical amusement device is not allowed to accumulate more than 15 replays at 1 time; the mechanical amusement device is designed so that accumulated free replays may only be discharged by reactivating the device for 1 additional play for each accumulated free replay; and the mechanical amusement device makes no permanent record, directly or indirectly, of the free replays awarded.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Subsection (1) does not apply to a slot machine if the slot machine is 25 years old or older and is not used for gambling purposes.

Every prize, toy, or edible item must be retrievable by the claw. A slot machine is not considered a crane game.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A person who knowingly alters a crane game that is available for play so that the crane game is not in compliance with the elements of the definition contained in subsection (5) is guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 2 years, or a fine of not more than $20,000.00, or both.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A law enforcement officer may confiscate any crane game that is available for play and is not in compliance with the elements of the definition contained in subsection (5). The confiscated crane games and their contents shall not be destroyed, altered, dismantled, sold, or otherwise disposed of except upon order of a court having competent jurisdiction.</DIV>

People v McDonald, 409 Mich 110; 293 NW2d 588 (1980).In People v Gay, 407 Mich 681; 289 NW2d 651 (1980), the Michigan supreme court held that the prosecution of defendants under this section subsequent to their convictions in federal court for the same acts is limited by the double jeopardy clause of the Michigan constitution.In People v Wilder, 411 Mich 328; 308 NW2d 112 (1981), the Michigan supreme court held that conviction and sentence for both first-degree felony murder and the underlying felony of armed robbery violates the state constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.A mandatory life sentence imposed for conspiracy to commit first-degree, even if nonparolable, is not so excessive as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment; nor does it violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the Michigan and United States Constitutions.

  <p><BR><B>History:</B> Add. 1974, Act 266, Eff. Apr. 1, 1975 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> This section, the rape-shield law, is not unconstitutional. People v Arenda, 416 Mich 1; 330 NW2nd 814 (1982).In Michigan v Lucas, 500 US 145; 111 S Ct 1743; 114 L Ed2d 205 (1991), the United States Supreme Court held that the Michigan Court of Appeals had erred in adopting a “per se rule” that the notice-and-hearing requirement of Michigan's rape-shield law violated the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution in all cases where it was used to preclude evidence of past sexual conduct between a rape victim and a defendant (see People v Lucas, 160 Mich App 692; 408 NW2d 431 (1987)). The Court found that the statute “serves legitimate state interests in protecting against surprise, harassment, and undue delay. Failure to comply with this requirement may ... justify even the severe sanction of preclusion.”<BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> Section 2 of Act 266 of 1974 provides:“Saving clause.“All proceedings pending and all rights and liabilities existing, acquired, or incurred at the time this amendatory act takes effect are saved and may be consummated according to the law in force when they are commenced.
