<P>Sec. 10.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A member of the commission shall continue to serve until a successor is appointed and qualified. A majority of the port commissioners constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business and the concurrence of the majority of the commissioners shall be necessary for the passage of a resolution. The business of the commission shall not be transacted unless there are in office at least a majority of the full number of commissioners fixed by law. A person shall not be eligible to hold the office of port commissioner unless the person is a qualified voter, a property owner within the port district, and is and has been a resident in the port district for at least 3 years. A member of a port commission shall not have a financial interest in the profits of a contract or business transaction with the port district. This prohibition shall not apply if the commission declares, on the record, and it is found by unanimous vote of the members present not having a financial interest, that the best interests of the district are to be served by the waiving of the prohibition in a particular case, and then only if competitive purchasing and contracting are used in the case, or if the members of the commission not having an interest, unanimously determine that competitive purchasing or contracting is not feasible in that particular case. A vacancy in the office of port commissioner may occur by death, resignation, or removal as provided in this section, by conviction of a felony, by statutory disqualification, or by a permanent disability preventing the proper discharge of the duties of a commissioner. The county board of commissioners may remove a port commissioner for habitual misconduct, misfeasance, habitual or wilful neglect of duty, or when the board is satisfied that the officer is incompetent to properly execute the duties of the office. A member of a port district appointed by the governing body of a city or township or cities or townships as provided in section 9, may be removed by the governing body for any of the reasons set forth in this section. A commissioner, within 20 days after the commission receives notice of appointment, shall qualify by taking and subscribing the constitutional oath of office.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 30.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   It shall be the duty of the port commission of any port district, before creating any improvements hereunder, to adopt a comprehensive port plan of harbor improvement in such port district after a public hearing thereon, of which at least 10 days' notice shall be published in a daily newspaper of general circulation in such port district. Such comprehensive port plan shall include an indication of the relationship of the area designated as the port area by the comprehensive port plan to land transportation and other land uses related to port activities. The port commission shall submit to the legislative body of any city, village or township, for its approval, that portion of the comprehensive plan which includes territory lying within the boundaries of the said city, village or township. Such submission shall be made by delivering the said portion of the comprehensive port plan to the clerk of the city, village or township involved, and if approved by the legislative body thereof, shall take effect from the date of such approval. If within 180 days after submission the legislative body of such city, village or township fails to disapprove such portion of the plan as shall have been submitted, it shall be thereupon presumed that such city, village or township has approved the same and such portion of the plan shall become effective without further notice. If the legislative body of the city, village or township to which a portion of the plan as amended or altered has been submitted disapproves the same, the commission may proceed to make such public improvements on lands leased or owned by the port commission as are prescribed in said plan to be made in the other part or parts of the port district. The port commission shall have the power to amend or alter the comprehensive port plan: Provided, however, That wherever such amendments or alterations of the comprehensive port plan include any area or territory lying within a city, village or township, that portion of the amendment or alteration shall be submitted to the legislative body of said city, village or township for its approval. Such submission shall be made by delivering the said portion of the comprehensive port plan, as amended or altered, to the clerk of the city, village or township involved, and if approved by the legislative body thereof, shall take effect from the date of such approval. If within 180 days after submission the legislative body of such city, village or township fails to disapprove that portion of the amendment or alteration of the comprehensive plan, it shall be thereupon presumed that such city, village or township has approved the same, and such portion of the comprehensive plan, as amended or altered, shall become effective without further notice. If the legislative body of the city, village or township to which a portion of the plan as amended or altered has been submitted disapproves the same, the commission may proceed to make such public improvements on lands leased or owned by the port commission as are prescribed in such amendment or alteration of the port plan to be made in the other part or parts of the port district. Wherever the legislative body of any city, village or township has approved that portion of the comprehensive port plan which includes the area or territory of such city, village or township, it shall be the duty of the port commission to recommend the zoning district classifications for the area to said legislative body: Provided, however, That nothing herein contained shall be construed as conferring, directly or indirectly, upon said port district, or port district commission or authority, power or powers to acquire, own, maintain or operate the Detroit, Michigan—Windsor, Ontario, Canada tunnel or international bridge: And provided further, That where any language in said act is in conflict with this prohibition, then and in that event any such language shall be deemed to be void and of no force or effect.</DIV>

In port districts coterminous with a county the commission shall also file with the board of supervisors of the county on or before September 1 of each year a budget setting out in detail its program for the ensuing year, together with the several amounts estimated by the commission to be necessary for the purposes indicated therein. The board of supervisors may decrease the budget proposed by the commission and also eliminate specific items. In port districts coterminous with 2 or more counties, the boards of supervisors of the counties included in the port district shall appoint a port district budget committee composed of not more than 15 members of the boards of supervisors. Representation on the port district budget committee from each county in the port district shall be, as near as may be, in proportion to the state equalized value of the county in relation to the total state equalized value of the port district.

The boards of supervisors may decrease the budget recommended by the port district budget committee and also eliminate specific items. The budget shall be approved by boards of supervisors with 66-2/3% of the state equalized value of the total port district and the budget as approved shall be reported to the port district budget committee and port commissions, and shall become final and binding on the boards of supervisors of all the counties in the port district, and the boards of supervisors shall appropriate their proportionate share of the total budget for the port district. The budget shall be apportioned between the counties in proportion to the state equalized value of the county in relation to the total state equalized value of the port district. No money shall be expended by the commission for any purpose not included in the budget as approved by the port district budget committee and the boards of supervisors of the county or counties in the district. In port districts coterminous with a county, all disbursements shall be made by the county treasurer on warrants drawn by the board of county auditors, or in port districts having no board of county auditors on warrants drawn by the county clerk, upon order of vouchers approved by the port commission. In port districts of 2 or more counties, disbursements shall be made by the county treasurer designated by the commission subject to the same conditions imposed on the county treasurer of a port district coterminous with 1 county. Port districts coterminous with a city or township shall follow the same procedure, as near as may be, substituting the local governing body and local officers where applicable for the board of supervisors and county officials, and be subject to the same conditions as set forth for county port districts, and port districts coterminous with 2 or more cities or townships shall in the same manner follow the procedure as near as may be and be subject to the same conditions as set forth for port districts coterminous with 2 or more counties.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An authority and 1 or more constituent units may enter into a contract or contracts for the acquisition, improvement, enlargement, or extension of port facilities and for the payment of the cost thereof by the contracting constituent units, with interest, over a period of not more than 40 years.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Each contracting constituent unit shall pledge its full faith and credit for the payment of its obligations under the contract. If the constituent unit has taxing power, each year it shall levy a tax upon all real and personal property within the constituent unit, which may be imposed without limitation as to rate or amount, to the extent necessary for the prompt payment of that part of the contract obligations as shall fall due before the following year's tax collection. The tax shall be in addition to any tax which the contracting constituent unit may otherwise be authorized to levy and may be imposed without limitation as to rate or amount, but shall not be in excess of the rate or amount necessary to pay the contract obligation. If any contracting constituent unit at the time of its annual tax levy has on hand in cash any amount pledged to the payment of the current obligations for which the tax levy is to be made, then the annual tax levy may be reduced by that amount. For the purpose of obtaining the credit, funds may be raised by a contracting constituent unit in 1 or more of the following methods:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   By service charge to users of the facilities owned by the port authority.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   By setting aside state collected funds disbursed to the contracting constituent unit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   By special assessment upon lands benefited.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   By setting aside any other available money.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A contracting constituent unit may agree to raise all or any part of its contract obligation by 1 or more of the methods enumerated in subsection (2) which may be available. The various powers granted in this act to a constituent unit shall be exercised by its governing body.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a constituent unit, other than a county, operating under this act elects to raise money to pay all or a portion of its share of the cost of a project by assessing the costs upon benefited lands, its governing body shall so determine by resolution and fix the district therefor. The governing body shall then cause a special assessment roll to be prepared and thereafter the proceedings in respect to the special assessment roll and the making and collection of the special assessments on the roll, shall be in accordance with the provisions of the statute or charter governing special assessments in the constituent unit, except that the total assessment may be divided into any number of installments not exceeding 30, and any person assessed shall have the right at the hearing upon the special assessment roll to object to the special assessment district previously established.</DIV>
