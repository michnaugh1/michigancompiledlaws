<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>For purposes of this act:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Subject to subdivision (f), a person has "notice" of a fact if the person has any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Actual knowledge of it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Received a notice or notification of it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) From all the facts and circumstances known to the person at the time in question, reason to know that it exists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Knowledge" means actual knowledge. "Knows" has a corresponding meaning.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Discover", "learn", or words of similar import refer to knowledge rather than to reason to know.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A person "notifies" or "gives" a notice or notification to another person by taking those steps as may be reasonably required to inform the other person in ordinary course, whether or not the other person actually comes to know of it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Subject to subdivision (f), a person "receives" a notice or notification when either of the following occurs:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) It comes to that person's attention.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) It is duly delivered in a form reasonable under the circumstances at the place of business through which the contract was made or at another location held out by that person as the place for receipt of those communications.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Notice, knowledge, or a notice or notification received by an organization is effective for a particular transaction from the time it is brought to the attention of the individual conducting that transaction and, in any event, from the time it would have been brought to the individual's attention if the organization had exercised due diligence. An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual's regular duties or the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Whether a transaction in the form of a lease creates a lease or security interest is determined by the facts of each case.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A transaction in the form of a lease creates a security interest if the consideration that the lessee is to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is an obligation for the term of the lease and is not subject to termination by the lessee, and any of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The original term of the lease is equal to or greater than the remaining economic life of the goods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The lessee is bound to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods or is bound to become the owner of the goods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The lessee has an option to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A transaction in the form of a lease does not create a security interest merely because any of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The present value of the consideration the lessee is obligated to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is substantially equal to or is greater than the fair market value of the goods at the time the lease is entered into.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The lessee assumes risk of loss of the goods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The lessee agrees to pay, with respect to the goods, taxes, insurance, filing, recording, or registration fees, or service or maintenance costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The lessee has an option to renew the lease or to become the owner of the goods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The lessee has an option to renew the lease for a fixed rent that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal at the time the option is to be performed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for a fixed price that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market value of the goods at the time the option is to be performed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Additional consideration is nominal if it is less than the lessee's reasonably predictable cost of performing under the lease agreement if the option is not exercised. Additional consideration is not nominal if either of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) When the option to renew the lease is granted to the lessee, the rent is stated to be the fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal determined at the time the option is to be performed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) When the option to become the owner of the goods is granted to the lessee, the price is stated to be the fair market value of the goods determined at the time the option is to be performed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The "remaining economic life of the goods" and "reasonably predictable" fair market rent, fair market value, or cost of performing under the lease agreement must be determined with reference to the facts and circumstances at the time the transaction is entered into.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) For purposes of this act, a "course of performance" is a sequence of conduct between the parties to a particular transaction that exists if both of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The agreement of the parties with respect to the transaction involves repeated occasions for performance by a party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The other party, with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it, accepts the performance or acquiesces in it without objection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) For purposes of this act, a "course of dealing" is a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For purposes of this act, a "usage of trade" is any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation, or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question. The existence and scope of a usage of trade must be proved as facts. If it is established that a usage of trade is embodied in a trade code or similar record, the interpretation of the record is a question of law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of trade in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware is relevant in ascertaining the meaning of the parties' agreement, may give particular meaning to specific terms of the agreement, and may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement. A usage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement is to occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (6), the express terms of an agreement and any applicable course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade must be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other. All of the following apply if that construction is unreasonable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Express terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Course of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Course of dealing prevails over usage of trade.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Subject to section 2209, a course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by 1 party is not admissible unless that party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise to the other party.</div>

<P>Sec. 2105.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    "Goods" means all things (including specially manufactured goods) which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in which the price is to be paid, investment securities (article 8) and things in action. "Goods" also includes the unborn young of animals and growing crops and other identified things attached to realty as described in the section on goods to be severed from realty (section 2107).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Goods must be both existing and identified before any interest in them can pass. Goods which are not both existing and identified are "future" goods. A purported present sale of future goods or of any interest therein operates as a contract to sell.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   There may be a sale of a part interest in existing identified goods.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   An undivided share in an identified bulk of fungible goods is sufficiently identified to be sold although the quantity of the bulk is not determined. Any agreed proportion of such a bulk or any quantity thereof agreed upon by number, weight or other measure may to the extent of the seller's interest in the bulk be sold to the buyer who then becomes an owner in common.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   "Lot" means a parcel or a single article which is the subject matter of a separate sale or delivery, whether or not it is sufficient to perform the contract. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   "Commercial unit" means such a unit of goods as by commercial usage is a single whole for purposes of sale and division of which materially impairs its character or value on the market or in use. A commercial unit may be a single article (as a machine) or a set of articles (as a suite of furniture or an assortment of sizes) or a quantity (as a bale, gross, or carload) or any other unit treated in use or in the relevant market as a single whole.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2106.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    In this article unless the context otherwise requires "contract" and "agreement" are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. "Contract for sale" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A "sale" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (section 2401). A "present sale" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are "conforming" or conform to the contract when they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   "Termination" occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On "termination" all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   "Cancellation" occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of "termination" except that the cancelling party also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2107.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    A contract for the sale of minerals or the like, (including oil and gas) or a structure or its materials to be removed from realty is a contract for the sale of goods within this article if they are to be severed by the seller but until severance a purported present sale thereof which is not effective as a transfer of an interest in land is effective only as a contract to sell.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A contract for the sale apart from the land of growing crops or other things attached to realty and capable of severance without material harm thereto but not described in subsection (1) or of timber to be cut is a contract for the sale of goods within this article whether the subject matter is to be severed by the buyer or by the seller even though it forms part of the realty at the time of contracting, and the parties can by identification effect a present sale before severance. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The provisions of this section are subject to any third party rights provided by the law relating to realty records, and the contract for sale may be executed and recorded as a document transferring an interest in land and shall then constitute notice to third parties of the buyer's rights under the contract for sale. </DIV>

<P>Sec. 2201.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $1,000.00 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is a writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his or her authorized agent or broker. A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this subsection beyond the quantity of goods shown in the writing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Between merchants, if within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of subsection (1) against the party unless written notice of objection to its contents is given within 10 days after it is received.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A contract that does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) but is valid in other respects is enforceable in any of the following circumstances:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of the seller's business and the seller, before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances that reasonably indicate that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in his or her pleading or testimony or otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made, but the contract is not enforceable under this section beyond the quantity of goods admitted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   With respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or that have been received and accepted under section 2606.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2206.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   an order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment shall be construed as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by the prompt or current shipment of conforming or nonconforming goods, but such a shipment of nonconforming goods does not constitute an acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the shipment is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Where the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2207.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract. Between merchants such terms become part of the contract unless:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   they materially alter it; or</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract. In such case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of this act.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2209.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    An agreement modifying a contract within this article needs no consideration to be binding.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded, but except as between merchants such a requirement on a form supplied by the merchant must be separately signed by the other party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The requirements of the statute of frauds section of this article (section 2201) must be satisfied if the contract as modified is within its provisions.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) it can operate as a waiver.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of the contract may retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver. </DIV>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>440.2210 Delegation of performance; assignment of rights.</B><P>
</P>
<P>Sec. 2210.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A party may perform that party's duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having that other party's original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Unless otherwise agreed all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on the other party by that other party's contract, or impair materially the other party's chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of his or her entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the seller's interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer's chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection (2) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection, and enforcement of the security interest remain effective, but (i) the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer, and (ii) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary, a prohibition of assignment of "the contract" is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor's performance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   An assignment of "the contract" or of "all my rights under the contract" or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by the assignee to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to that other party's rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee (section 2609).</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   the price is to be fixed in terms of some agreed market or other standard as set or recorded by a third person or agency and it is not so set or recorded.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A price to be fixed by the seller or by the buyer means a price for him to fix in good faith.</DIV>

In such a case the buyer must return any goods already received or if unable so to do must pay their reasonable value at the time of delivery and the seller must return any portion of the price paid on account.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   An affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal words such as "warrant" or "guarantee" or that he or she have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the seller's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty, except as provided in the art multiples sales act and Act No. 121 of the Public Acts of 1970, being sections 442.321 to 442.325 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and words or conduct tending to negate or limit warranty shall be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other; but subject to the provisions of this article on parol or extrinsic evidence (section 2202) negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that such construction is unreasonable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it states, for example, that "There are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof."</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Notwithstanding subsection (2):</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are excluded by expressions like "as is", "with all faults" or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer's attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   when the buyer before entering into the contract has examined the goods or the sample or model as fully as he desired or has refused to examine the goods there is no implied warranty with regard to defects which an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed to him; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   an implied warranty can also be excluded or modified by course of dealing or course of performance or usage of trade; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   with respect to the sale of cattle, hogs, or sheep, there is no implied warranty that the cattle, hogs, or sheep are free from disease, if the seller shows that all state and federal law concerning animal health has been satisfied.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   when the term is F.O.B. the place of shipment, the seller must at that place ship the goods in the manner provided in this article (section 2504) and bear the expense and risk of putting them into the possession of the carrier; or</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   when the term is F.O.B. the place of destination, the seller must at his own expense and risk transport the goods to that place and there tender delivery of them in the manner provided in this article (section 2503);</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   when under either (a) or (b) the term is also F.O.B. vessel, car or other vehicle, the seller must in addition at his own expense and risk load the goods on board. If the term is F.O.B. vessel the buyer must name the vessel and in an appropriate case the seller must comply with the provisions of this article on the form of bill of lading (section 2323). </DIV>

The seller may treat the failure of needed instructions as a failure of cooperation under this article (section 2311). He may also at his option move the goods in any reasonable manner preparatory to delivery or shipment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Under the term F.O.B. vessel or F.A.S. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender nor the buyer demand delivery of the goods in substitution for the documents. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   put the goods into the possession of a carrier at the port for shipment and obtain a negotiable bill or bills of lading covering the entire transportation to the named destination; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   load the goods and obtain a receipt from the carrier (which may be contained in the bill of lading) showing that the freight has been paid or provided for; and </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   obtain a policy or certificate of insurance, including any war risk insurance, of a kind and on terms then current at the port of shipment in the usual amount, in the currency of the contract, shown to cover the same goods covered by the bill of lading and providing for payment of loss to the order of the buyer or for the account of whom it may concern; but the seller may add to the price the amount of the premium for any such war risk insurance; and</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An agreement described in subsection (1) or any warranty of quality or condition of the goods on arrival places upon the seller the risk of ordinary deterioration, shrinkage and the like in transportation but has no effect on the place or time of identification to the contract for sale or delivery or on the passing of the risk of loss.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Unless otherwise agreed the term "letter of credit" or "banker's credit" in a contract for sale means an irrevocable credit issued by a financing agency of good repute and, where the shipment is overseas, of good international repute.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    In a sale by auction if goods are put up in lots each lot is the subject of a separate sale.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer so announces by the fall of the hammer or in other customary manner.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Such a sale is with reserve unless the goods are in explicit terms put up without reserve. In an auction with reserve the auctioneer may withdraw the goods at any time until he announces completion of the sale. In an auction without reserve, after the auctioneer calls for bids on an article or lot, that article or lot cannot be withdrawn unless no bid is made within a reasonable time. In either case a bidder may retract his bid until the auctioneer's announcement of completion of the sale, but a bidder's retraction does not revive any previous bid.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale before their identification to the contract under section 2501, and unless otherwise explicitly agreed the buyer acquires by their identification a special property as limited by this act. Any retention or reservation by the seller of the title (property) in goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest. Subject to these provisions and to the provisions of article 9, title to goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Unless subparagraph (ii) applies, if the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer but does not require the seller to deliver them at destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of shipment. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed where delivery is to be made without moving the goods, 1 of the following applies:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the seller is to deliver a tangible document of title, title passes at the time when and the place where the seller delivers the document of title.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the seller is to deliver an electronic document of title, title passes when the seller delivers the document.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents of title are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance revests title to the goods in the seller.

</P>
<P>Sec. 2403.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    A purchaser of goods acquires all title which his transferor had or had power to transfer except that a purchaser of a limited interest acquires rights only to the extent of the interest purchased. A person with voidable title has power to transfer a good title to a good faith purchaser for value. When goods have been delivered under a transaction of purchase the purchaser has such power even though</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   the transferor was deceived as to the identity of the purchaser; or</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   the delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored; or</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   it was agreed that the transaction was to be a "cash sale"; or</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   the delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal law. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Any entrusting of possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that kind gives him power to transfer all rights of the entruster to a buyer in ordinary course of business.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   "Entrusting" includes any delivery and any acquiescence in retention of possession regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery or acquiescence and regardless of whether the procurement of the entrusting or the possessor's disposition of the goods have been such as to be larcenous under the criminal law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The rights of other purchasers of goods and of lien creditors are governed by the articles on secured transactions (article 9), bulk transfers (article 6) and documents of title (article 7).</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2501.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The buyer obtains a special property and an insurable interest in goods by identification of existing goods as goods to which the contract refers even though the goods so identified are nonconforming and he has an option to return or reject them. Such identification can be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. In the absence of explicit agreement identification occurs</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   when the contract is made if it is for the sale of goods already existing and identified;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   if the contract is for the sale of future goods other than those described in paragraph (c), when goods are shipped, marked or otherwise designated by the seller as goods to which the contract refers;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   when the crops are planted or otherwise becoming growing crops or the young are conceived if the contract is for the sale of unborn young to be born within 12 months after contracting or for the sale of crops to be harvested within 12 months or the next normal harvest season after contracting whichever is longer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The seller retains an insurable interest in goods so long as title to or any security interest in the goods remains in him and where the identification is by the seller alone he may until default or insolvency or notification to the buyer that the identification is final substitute other goods for those identified.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Nothing in this section impairs any insurable interest recognized under any other statute or rule of law.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2502.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Subject to subsections (2) and (3) and even though the goods have not been shipped a buyer who has paid a part or all of the price of goods in which he or she has a special property under the provisions of the immediately preceding section may on making and keeping good a tender of any unpaid portion of their price recover them from the seller if 1 of the following occurs:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   In the case of goods bought for personal, family, or household purposes, the seller repudiates or fails to deliver as required by the contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   In all cases, the seller becomes insolvent within 10 days after receipt of the first installment on their price.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The buyer's right to recover the goods under subsection (1)(a) vests upon acquisition of a special property, even if the seller had not then repudiated or failed to deliver.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the identification creating his or her special property has been made by the buyer he or she acquires the right to recover the goods only if they conform to the contract for sale.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Tender of delivery requires that the seller put and hold conforming goods at the buyer's disposition and give the buyer any notification reasonably necessary to enable the buyer to take delivery. The manner, time, and place for tender are determined by the agreement and this article, and in particular all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Tender must be at a reasonable hour, and if it is a tender of goods, the goods must be kept available for the period reasonably necessary to enable the buyer to take possession. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Unless otherwise agreed, the buyer must furnish facilities reasonably suited to the receipt of the goods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If section 2504 applies to a shipment, tender requires that the seller comply with that section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a seller is required to deliver at a particular destination, tender requires that the seller comply with subsection (1) and also, if appropriate, tender documents as described in subsections (4) and (5). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If goods are in the possession of a bailee and are to be delivered without being moved, both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), tender requires that the seller either tender a negotiable document of title covering the goods or procure acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyer's right to possession of the goods. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Tender to the buyer of a nonnegotiable document of title or of a record directing the bailee to deliver is sufficient tender unless the buyer seasonally objects, and except as otherwise provided in article 9, receipt by the bailee of notification of the buyer's rights fixes those rights as against the bailee and all third persons. However, risk of loss of the goods and of any failure by the bailee to honor the nonnegotiable document of title or to obey the direction remains on the seller until the buyer has had a reasonable time to present the document or direction, and a refusal by the bailee to honor the document or to obey the direction defeats the tender.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Both of the following apply if the contract requires the seller to deliver documents:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The seller must tender all the documents in correct form, except as provided in section 2323(2) with respect to bills of lading in a set. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Tender through customary banking channels is sufficient and dishonor of a draft accompanying or associated with the documents constitutes nonacceptance or rejection.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Where the seller is required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer and the contract does not require him to deliver them at a particular destination, then unless otherwise agreed he must</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   promptly notify the buyer of the shipment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Failure to notify the buyer under paragraph (c) or to make a proper contract under paragraph (a) is a ground for rejection only if material delay or loss ensues.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Both of the following apply if a seller has identified goods to a contract by or before shipment:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The seller's procurement of a negotiable bill of lading to the seller's own order or otherwise reserves in the seller a security interest in the goods. The seller's procurement of the bill to the order of a financing agency or of the buyer indicates in addition only the seller's expectation of transferring that interest to the person named.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A nonnegotiable bill of lading to the seller or the seller's nominee reserves possession of the goods as security. However, except in a case of conditional delivery under section 2507(2), a nonnegotiable bill of lading naming the buyer as consignee does not reserve a security interest even if the seller retains possession or control of the bill of lading.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a shipment by a seller with reservation of a security interest is in violation of the contract for sale, it constitutes an improper contract for transportation within section 2504 but it does not impair the rights given to the buyer by shipment and identification of the goods to the contract or impair the seller's powers as a holder of a negotiable document of title.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If goods are held by a bailee to be delivered without being moved, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when 1 of the following occurs:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The buyer receives possession or control of a negotiable document of title covering the goods. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The bailee provides acknowledgment of the buyer's right to possession of the goods. </div>

<P>Sec. 2607.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The buyer must pay at the contract rate for any goods accepted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Acceptance of goods by the buyer precludes rejection of the goods accepted and if made with knowledge of a nonconformity cannot be revoked because of it unless the acceptance was on the reasonable assumption that the nonconformity would be seasonably cured but acceptance does not of itself impair any other remedy provided by this article for nonconformity.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Where a tender has been accepted</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   the buyer must within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have discovered any breach notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   if the claim is one for infringement or the like (subsection (3) of section 2312) and the buyer is sued as a result of such a breach he must so notify the seller within a reasonable time after he receives notice of the litigation or be barred from any remedy over for liability established by the litigation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The burden is on the buyer to establish any breach with respect to the goods accepted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Where the buyer is sued for breach of a warranty or other obligation for which his seller is answerable over</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   he may give his seller written notice of the litigation. If the notice states that the seller may come in and defend and that if the seller does not do so he will be bound in any action against him by his buyer by any determination of fact common to the 2 litigations, then unless the seller after seasonable receipt of the notice does come in and defend he is so bound</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   if the claim is one for infringement or the like (subsection (3) of section 2312) the original seller may demand in writing that his buyer turn over to him control of the litigation including settlement or else be barred from any remedy over and if he also agrees to bear all expense and to satisfy any adverse judgment, then unless the buyer after seasonable receipt of the demand does turn over control the buyer is so barred.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The provisions of subsections (3), (4) and (5) apply to any obligation of a buyer to hold the seller harmless against infringement or the like (subsection (3) of section 2312).</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2608.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The buyer may revoke his acceptance of a lot or commercial unit whose nonconformity substantially impairs its value to him if he has accepted it</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   on the reasonable assumption that its nonconformity would be cured and it has not been seasonably cured; or</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   without discovery of such nonconformity if his acceptance was reasonably induced either by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance or by the seller's assurances. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the buyer discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused by their own defects. It is not effective until the buyer notifies the seller of it. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A buyer who so revokes has the same rights and duties with regard to the goods involved as if he had rejected them.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2609.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    A contract for sale imposes an obligation on each party that the other's expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired. When reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party the other may in writing demand adequate assurance of due performance and until he receives such assurance may if commercially reasonable suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed return. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Between merchants the reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of any assurance offered shall be determined according to commercial standards. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Acceptance of any improper delivery or payment does not prejudice the aggrieved party's right to demand adequate assurance of future performance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   After receipt of a justified demand failure to provide within a reasonable time not exceeding 30 days such assurance of due performance as is adequate under the circumstances of the particular case is a repudiation of the contract.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2610.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   When either party repudiates the contract with respect to a performance not yet due the loss of which will substantially impair the value of the contract to the other, the aggrieved party may</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   for a commercially reasonable time await performance by the repudiating party; or</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   resort to any remedy for breach (section 2703 or section 2711), even though he has notified the repudiating party that he would await the latter's performance and has urged retraction; and </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   in either case suspend his own performance or proceed in accordance with the provisions of this article on the seller's right to identify goods to the contract notwithstanding breach or to salvage unfinished goods (section 2704).</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2611.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Until the repudiating party's next performance is due he can retract his repudiation unless the aggrieved party has since the repudiation cancelled or materially changed his position or otherwise indicated that he considers the repudiation final.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Retraction may be by any method which clearly indicates to the aggrieved party that the repudiating party intends to perform, but must include any assurance justifiably demanded under the provisions of this article (section 2609). </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Retraction reinstates the repudiating party's rights under the contract with due excuse and allowance to the aggrieved party for any delay occasioned by the repudiation. </DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2612.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    An "installment contract" is one which requires or authorizes the delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately accepted, even though the contract contains a clause "each delivery is a separate contract" or its equivalent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The buyer may reject any installment which is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured or if the nonconformity is a defect in the required documents; but if the nonconformity does not fall within subsection (3) and the seller gives adequate assurance of its cure the buyer must accept that installment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Whenever nonconformity or default with respect to one or more installments substantially impairs the value of the whole contract there is a breach of the whole. But the aggrieved party reinstates the contract if he accepts a nonconforming installment without seasonably notifying of cancellation or if he brings an action with respect only to past installments or demands performance as to future installments.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   if the loss is total the contract is avoided; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   if the loss is partial or the goods have so deteriorated as no longer to conform to the contract the buyer may nevertheless demand inspection and at his option either treat the contract as avoided or accept the goods with due allowance from the contract price for the deterioration or the deficiency in quantity but without further right against the seller.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2614.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Where without fault of either party the agreed berthing, loading, or unloading facilities fail or an agreed type of carrier becomes unavailable or the agreed manner of delivery otherwise becomes commercially impracticable but a commercially reasonable substitute is available, such substitute performance must be tendered and accepted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the agreed means or manner of payment fails because of domestic or foreign governmental regulation, the seller may withhold or stop delivery unless the buyer provides a means or manner of payment which is commercially a substantial equivalent. If delivery has already been taken, payment by the means or in the manner provided by the regulation discharges the buyer's obligation unless the regulation is discriminatory, oppressive or predatory.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Delay in delivery or nondelivery in whole or in part by a seller who complies with paragraphs (b) and (c) is not a breach of his duty under a contract for sale if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made or by compliance in good faith with any applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order whether or not it later proves to be invalid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Where the causes mentioned in paragraph (a) affect only a part of the seller's capacity to perform, he must allocate production and deliveries among his customers but may at his option include regular customers not then under contract as well as his own requirements for further manufacture. He may so allocate in any manner which is fair and reasonable.</DIV>

Except as provided in this subsection the seller may not base a right to reclaim goods on the buyer's fraudulent or innocent misrepresentation of solvency or of intent to pay.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The seller's right to reclaim under subsection (2) is subject to the rights of a buyer in ordinary course or other good faith purchaser or lien creditor under this article (section 2403). Successful reclamation of goods excludes all other remedies with respect to them.</DIV>

Where the resale is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner the seller may recover the difference between the resale price and the contract price together with any incidental damages allowed under the provisions of this article (section 2710), but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer's breach.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) or unless otherwise agreed resale may be at public or private sale including sale by way of one or more contracts to sell or of identification to an existing contract of the seller. Sale may be as a unit or in parcels and at any time and place and on any terms but every aspect of the sale including the method, manner, time, place and terms must be commercially reasonable. The resale must be reasonably identified as referring to the broken contract, but it is not necessary that the goods be in existence or that any or all of them have been identified to the contract before the breach.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Where the resale is at private sale the seller must give the buyer reasonable notification of his intention to resell.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Where the resale is at public sale</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   only identified goods can be sold except where there is a recognized market for a public sale of futures in goods of the kind; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   it must be made at a usual place or market for public sale if one is reasonably available and except in the case of goods which are perishable or threaten to decline in value speedily the seller must give the buyer reasonable notice of the time and place of the resale; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   if the goods are not to be within the view of those attending the sale the notification of sale must state the place where the goods are located and provide for their reasonable inspection by prospective bidders; and</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A purchaser who buys in good faith at a resale takes the goods free of any rights of the original buyer even though the seller fails to comply with one or more of the requirements of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The seller is not accountable to the buyer for any profit made on any resale. A person in the position of a seller (section 2707) or a buyer who has rightfully rejected or justifiably revoked acceptance must account for any excess over the amount of his security interest, as hereinafter defined (subsection (3) of section 2711).</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the measure of damages provided in subsection (1) is inadequate to put the seller in as good a position as performance would have done then the measure of damages is the profit (including reasonable overhead) which the seller would have made from full performance by the buyer, together with any incidental damages provided in this article (section 2710), due allowance for costs reasonably incurred and due credit for payments or proceeds of resale.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2718.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section and of the preceding section on liquidation and limitation of damages</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   the agreement may provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this article and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this article, as by limiting the buyer's remedies to return of the goods and repayment of the price or to repair and replacement of nonconforming goods or parts; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   resort to a remedy as provided is optional unless the remedy is expressly agreed to be exclusive, in which case it is the sole remedy. </DIV>

<P>Sec. 2A108.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a court, as a matter of law, finds a lease contract or any clause of a lease contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made, the court may refuse to enforce the lease contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the lease contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   With respect to a consumer lease, if a court, as a matter of law, finds that a lease contract or any clause of a lease contract has been induced by unconscionable conduct or that unconscionable conduct has occurred in the collection of a claim arising from a lease contract, the court may grant appropriate relief.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Before making a finding of unconscionability under subsection (1) or (2), the court, on its own motion or that of a party, shall afford the parties a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to the setting, purpose, and effect of the lease contract or clause thereof, or of the conduct. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In an action in which the lessee claims unconscionability with respect to a consumer lease, all of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the court finds unconscionability under subsection (1) or (2), the court shall award reasonable attorney's fees to the lessee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the court does not find unconscionability and the lessee claiming unconscionability has brought or maintained an action he or she knew to be groundless, the court shall award reasonable attorney's fees to the party against whom the claim is made.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   In determining attorney's fees, the amount of the recovery on behalf of the claimant under subsections (1) and (2) is not controlling. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A term providing that 1 party or his or her successor in interest may accelerate payment or performance or require collateral or additional collateral "at will" or when he or she deems himself or herself insecure or in words of similar import must be construed to mean that he or she has power to do so only if he or she in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance is impaired.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   With respect to a motor vehicle or trailer, notwithstanding any other provision of law, a transaction does not create a sale or security interest merely because it provides that the rental price is permitted or required to be adjusted under the agreement either upward or downward by reference to the amount realized upon sale or other disposition of the motor vehicle or trailer.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2A201.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A lease contract is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless 1 of the following applies:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The total payments to be made under the lease contract, excluding payments for options to renew or buy, are less than $1,000.00.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   There is a writing, signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by that party's authorized agent, sufficient to indicate that a lease contract has been made between the parties and to describe the goods leased and the lease term.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Any description of leased goods or of the lease term is sufficient and satisfies subsection (1)(b), whether or not it is specific, if it reasonably identifies what is described.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon, but the lease contract is not enforceable under subsection (1)(b) beyond the lease term and the quantity of goods shown in the writing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A lease contract that does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (1), but which is valid in other respects, is enforceable for any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the goods are to be specially manufactured or obtained for the lessee and are not suitable for lease or sale to others in the ordinary course of the lessor's business, and the lessor, before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances that reasonably indicate that the goods are for the lessee, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in that party's pleading, testimony, or otherwise in court that a lease contract was made, but the lease contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   With respect to goods that have been received and accepted by the lessee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The lease term under a lease contract referred to in subsection (4) is determined as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Term specified if there is a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by that party's authorized agent specifying the lease term.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in that party's pleading, testimony, or otherwise in court a lease term, the term so admitted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A reasonable lease term.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2A209.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The benefit of a supplier's promises to the lessor under the supply contract and of all warranties, whether express or implied, including those of any third party provided in connection with or as part of the supply contract, extends to the lessee to the extent of the lessee's leasehold interest under a finance lease related to the supply contract, but is subject to the terms of the warranty and of the supply contract and all defenses or claims arising therefrom.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The extension of the benefit of a supplier's promises and of warranties to the lessee does not do either of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Modify the rights and obligations of the parties to the supply contract, whether arising therefrom or otherwise.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Impose any duty or liability under the supply contract on the lessee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Any modification or rescission of the supply contract by the supplier and the lessor is effective between the supplier and the lessee unless, before the modification or rescission, the supplier has received notice that the lessee has entered into a finance lease related to the supply contract. If the modification or rescission is effective between the supplier and the lessee, the lessor is deemed to have assumed, in addition to the obligations of the lessor to the lessee under the lease contract, promises of the supplier to the lessor and warranties that were so modified or rescinded as they existed and were available to the lessee before modification or rescission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In addition to the extension of the benefit of the supplier's promises and of warranties to the lessee under subsection (1), the lessee retains all rights that the lessee may have against the supplier which arise from an agreement between the lessee and the supplier or under other law. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Express warranties by the lessor are created as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the lessor to the lessee which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods will conform to the affirmation or promise.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods will conform to the description.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Any sample or model that is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods will conform to the sample or model.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the lessor use formal words, such as "warrant" or "guarantee", or that the lessor have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the lessor's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   There is in a lease contract a warranty that for the lease term no person holds a claim to or interest in the goods that arose from an act or omission of the lessor, other than a claim by way of infringement or the like, which will interfere with the lessee's enjoyment of its leasehold interest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except in a finance lease, there is in a lease contract by a lessor who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind a warranty that the goods are delivered free of the rightful claim of any person by way of infringement or the like.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A lessee who furnishes specifications to a lessor or a supplier shall hold the lessor and the supplier harmless against any claim by way of infringement or the like that arises out of compliance with the specifications.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Except in a finance lease, if the lessor at the time the lease contract is made has reason to know of any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the lessee is relying on the lessor's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is in the lease contract an implied warranty that the goods will be fit for that purpose.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2A214.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and words or conduct tending to negate or limit a warranty must be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other, but, subject to the provisions of section 2A202 on parol or extrinsic evidence, negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that the construction is unreasonable. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it, the language must mention "merchantability", be by a writing, and be conspicuous. Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness, the exclusion must be by a writing and be conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it is in writing, is conspicuous, and states, for example, "There is no warranty that the goods will be fit for a particular purpose". </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Notwithstanding subsection (2), but subject to subsection (4), all of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are excluded by expressions like "as is", or "with all faults", or by other language that in common understanding calls the lessee's attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty, if in writing and conspicuous.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the lessee before entering into the lease contract has examined the goods or the sample or model as fully as desired or has refused to examine the goods, there is no implied warranty with regard to defects that an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   An implied warranty may also be excluded or modified by course of dealing, course of performance, or usage of trade.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   To exclude or modify a warranty against interference or against infringement (section 2A211) or any part of it, the language must be specific, be by a writing, and be conspicuous, unless the circumstances, including course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade, give the lessee reason to know that the goods are being leased subject to a claim or interest of any person.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Warranties, whether express or implied, must be construed as consistent with each other and as cumulative, but if that construction is unreasonable, the intention of the parties determines which warranty is dominant.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Exact or technical specifications displace an inconsistent sample or model or general language of description.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee under this article, whether express or implied, extends to any natural person who is in the family or household of the lessee or who is a guest in the lessee's home if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume, or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty. This section does not displace principles of law and equity that extend a warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee to other persons. The operation of this section may not be excluded, modified, or limited, but an exclusion, modification, or limitation of the warranty, including any with respect to rights and remedies, effective against the lessee is also effective against any beneficiary designated under this section.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2A218.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A lessee obtains an insurable interest when existing goods are identified to the lease contract even though the goods identified are nonconforming and the lessee has an option to reject them.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a lessee has an insurable interest only by reason of the lessor's identification of the goods, the lessor, until default or insolvency or notification to the lessee that identification is final, may substitute other goods for those identified.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Notwithstanding a lessee's insurable interest under subsections (1) and (2), the lessor retains an insurable interest until an option to buy has been exercised by the lessee and risk of loss has passed to the lessee. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Nothing in this section impairs any insurable interest recognized under any other statute or rule of law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The parties by agreement may determine that 1 or more parties have an obligation to obtain and pay for insurance covering the goods and by agreement may determine the beneficiary of the proceeds of the insurance. </DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2A219.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except in the case of a finance lease, risk of loss is retained by the lessor and does not pass to the lessee. In the case of a finance lease, risk of loss passes to the lessee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Subject to the provisions of this article on the effect of default on risk of loss (section 2A220), if risk of loss is to pass to the lessee and the time of passage is not stated, the following rules apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the lease contract requires or authorizes the goods to be shipped by carrier and it does not require delivery at a particular destination, the risk of loss passes to the lessee when the goods are duly delivered to the carrier, but if it does require delivery at a particular destination and the goods are there duly tendered while in the possession of the carrier, the risk of loss passes to the lessee when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable the lessee to take delivery.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the goods are held by a bailee to be delivered without being moved, the risk of loss passes to the lessee on acknowledgment by the bailee of the lessee's right to possession of the goods.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   In any case not within subdivision (a) or (b), the risk of loss passes to the lessee on the lessee's receipt of the goods if the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, is a merchant; otherwise, the risk passes to the lessee on tender of delivery.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2A220.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Where risk of loss is to pass to the lessee and the time of passage is not stated, then the following rules apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If a tender or delivery of goods so fails to conform to the lease contract as to give a right of rejection, the risk of their loss remains with the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, until cure or acceptance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the lessee rightfully revokes acceptance, he or she, to the extent of any deficiency in his or her effective insurance coverage, may treat the risk of loss as having remained with the lessor from the beginning. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Whether or not risk of loss is to pass to the lessee, if the lessee as to conforming goods already identified to a lease contract repudiates or is otherwise in default under the lease contract, the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, to the extent of any deficiency in his or her effective insurance coverage, may treat the risk of loss as resting on the lessee for a commercially reasonable time.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2A221.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If a lease contract requires goods identified when the lease contract is made, and the goods suffer casualty without fault of the lessee, the lessor, or the supplier before delivery, or the goods suffer casualty before risk of loss passes to the lessee pursuant to the lease agreement or section 2A219, then the following rules apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the loss is total, the lease contract is avoided.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the loss is partial or the goods have so deteriorated as to no longer conform to the lease contract, the lessee may nevertheless demand inspection and at his or her option either treat the lease contract as avoided or, except in a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, accept the goods with due allowance from the rent payable for the balance of the lease term for the deterioration or the deficiency in quantity but without further right against the lessor.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2A303.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   As used in this section, "creation of a security interest" includes the sale of a lease contract that is subject to article 9, secured transactions, by reason of section 9109(1)(c).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as provided in subsection (3) and section 9407, a provision in a lease agreement (i) which prohibits the voluntary or involuntary transfer, including a transfer by sale, sublease, creation, or enforcement of a security interest, or attachment, levy, or other judicial process, of an interest of a party under the lease contract or of the lessor's residual interest in the goods, or (ii) makes such a transfer an event of default, gives rise to the rights and remedies provided in subsection (4), but a transfer that is prohibited or is an event of default under the lease agreement is otherwise effective.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A provision in a lease agreement which (i) prohibits a transfer of a right to damages for default with respect to the whole lease contract or of a right to payment arising out of the transferor's due performance of the transferor's entire obligation, or (ii) makes such a transfer an event of default, is not enforceable, and such a transfer is not a transfer that materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of, or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the other party to the lease contract within the purview of subsection (4).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Subject to subsection (3) and section 9407, the following rules apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If a transfer is made which is made an event of default under a lease agreement, the party to the lease contract not making the transfer, unless that party waives the default or otherwise agrees, has the rights and remedies described in section 2A501(2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If subdivision (a) is not applicable and if a transfer is made that (i) is prohibited under a lease agreement or (ii) materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of, or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the other party to the lease contract, unless the party not making the transfer agrees at any time to the transfer in the lease contract or otherwise, then, except as limited by contract, the transferor is liable to the party not making the transfer for damages caused by the transfer to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the party not making the transfer and a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the lease contract or an injunction against the transfer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A transfer of "the lease" or of "all my rights under the lease" or a transfer in similar general terms is a transfer of rights and, unless the language or the circumstances, as in a transfer for security, indicate the contrary, the transfer is a delegation of duties by the transferor to the transferee. Acceptance by the transferee constitutes a promise by the transferee to perform those duties. The promise is enforceable by either the transferor or the other party to the lease contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Unless otherwise agreed by the lessor and the lessee, a delegation of performance does not relieve the transferor as against the other party of any duty to perform or of any liability for default.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   In a consumer lease, to prohibit the transfer of an interest of a party under the lease contract or to make a transfer an event of default, the language must be specific, by a writing, and conspicuous.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2A304.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Subject to section 2A303, a subsequent lessee from a lessor of goods under an existing lease contract obtains, to the extent of the leasehold interest transferred, the leasehold interest in the goods that the lessor had or had power to transfer, and except as provided in subsection (2) and section 2A527(4), takes subject to the existing lease contract. A lessor with voidable title has power to transfer a good leasehold interest to a good faith subsequent lessee for value, but only to the extent set forth in the preceding sentence. If goods have been delivered under a transaction of purchase, the lessor has that power even though any of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The lessor's transferor was deceived as to the identity of the lessor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   It was agreed that the transaction was to be a "cash sale".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A subsequent lessee in the ordinary course of business from a lessor who is a merchant dealing in goods of that kind to whom the goods were entrusted by the existing lessee of that lessor before the interest of the subsequent lessee became enforceable against that lessor obtains, to the extent of the leasehold interest transferred, all of that lessor's and the existing lessee's rights to the goods, and takes free of the existing lease contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A subsequent lessee from the lessor of goods that are subject to an existing lease contract and are covered by a certificate of title issued under a statute of this state or of another jurisdiction takes no greater rights than those provided both by this section and by the certificate of title statute.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Subject to section 2A303, a buyer or sublessee from the lessee of goods under an existing lease contract obtains, to the extent of the interest transferred, the leasehold interest in the goods that the lessee had or had power to transfer, and except as provided in subsection (2) and section 2A511(4), takes subject to the existing lease contract. A lessee with a voidable leasehold interest has power to transfer a good leasehold interest to a good faith buyer for value or a good faith sublessee for value, but only to the extent set forth in the preceding sentence. When goods have been delivered under a transaction of lease, the lessee has that power even though any of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The lessor was deceived as to the identity of the lessee.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A buyer or sublessee from the lessee of goods that are subject to an existing lease contract and are covered by a certificate of title issued under a statute of this state or of another jurisdiction takes no greater rights than those provided both by this section and by the certificate of title statute.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A creditor of a lessor in possession of goods subject to a lease contract may treat the lease contract as void if as against the creditor retention of possession by the lessor is fraudulent under any statute or rule of law, but retention of possession in good faith and current course of trade by the lessor for a commercially reasonable time after the lease contract becomes enforceable is not fraudulent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Nothing in this article impairs the rights of creditors of a lessor if the lease contract (i) becomes enforceable, not in current course of trade but in satisfaction of or as security for a preexisting claim for money, security, or the like, and (ii) is made under circumstances which under any statute or rule of law apart from this article would constitute the transaction a fraudulent transfer or voidable preference.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A creditor of a seller may treat a sale or an identification of goods to a contract for sale as void if as against the creditor retention of possession by the seller is fraudulent under any statute or rule of law, but retention of possession of the goods pursuant to a lease contract entered into by the seller as lessee and the buyer as lessor in connection with the sale or identification of the goods is not fraudulent if the buyer bought for value and in good faith.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2A309.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   As used in this section:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Goods" are "fixtures" when they become so related to particular real estate that an interest in them arises under real estate law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A "fixture filing" is the filing, in the office where a record of a mortgage on the real estate would be filed or recorded, of a financing statement covering goods that are or are to become fixtures and conforming to the requirements of section 9502(1) and (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A "lease" is a "purchase money lease" unless the lessee has possession or use of the goods or the right to possession or use of the goods before the lease agreement is enforceable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A "mortgage" is a "construction mortgage" to the extent it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land including the acquisition cost of the land, if the recorded writing so indicates.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   "Encumbrance" includes real estate mortgages and other liens on real estate and all other rights in real estate that are not ownership interests.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Under this article a lease may be of goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures, but no lease exists under this article of ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   This article does not prevent creation of a lease of fixtures pursuant to real estate law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The perfected interest of a lessor of fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if either of the following applies:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The lease is a purchase money lease, the conflicting interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures, the interest of the lessor is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within 10 days thereafter, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The interest of the lessor is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record, the lessor's interest has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The interest of a lessor of fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if any of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The fixtures are readily removable factory or office machines, readily removable equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real estate, or readily removable replacements of domestic appliances that are goods subject to a consumer lease, and before the goods become fixtures, the lease contract is enforceable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The conflicting interest is a lien on the real estate obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the lease contract is enforceable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The encumbrancer or owner has consented in writing to the lease or has disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The lessee has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner. If the lessee's right to remove terminates, the priority of the interest of the lessor continues for a reasonable time.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Notwithstanding subsection (4)(a) but otherwise subject to subsections (4) and (5), the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, is subordinate to the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a construction mortgage recorded before the goods become fixtures if the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. To the extent given to refinance a construction mortgage, the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a mortgage has this priority to the same extent as the encumbrancer of the real estate under the construction mortgage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   In cases not within the preceding subsections, priority between the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, and the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee is determined by the priority rules governing conflicting interests in real estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, has priority over all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, the lessor or the lessee may (i) on default, expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease agreement but subject to the lease agreement and this article, or (ii) if necessary to enforce other rights and remedies of the lessor or lessee under this article, remove the goods from the real estate, free and clear of all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, but the lessor or lessee must reimburse any encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury, but not for any diminution in value of the real estate caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity of replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   Even though the lease agreement does not create a security interest, the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, is perfected by filing a financing statement as a fixture filing for leased goods that are or are to become fixtures in accordance with the relevant provisions of article 9.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Goods are accessions when they are installed in or affixed to other goods.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract entered into before the goods became accessions is superior to all interests in the whole except as stated in subsection (4).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract entered into at the time or after the goods became accessions is superior to all subsequently acquired interests in the whole except as stated in subsection (4) but is subordinate to interests in the whole existing at the time the lease contract was made unless the holders of such interests in the whole have in writing consented to the lease or disclaimed an interest in the goods as part of the whole.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract described in subsection (2) or (3) is subordinate to the interest of either of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A buyer in the ordinary course of business or a lessee in the ordinary course of business of any interest in the whole acquired after the goods became accessions.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A creditor with a security interest in the whole perfected before the lease contract was made to the extent that the creditor makes subsequent advances without knowledge of the lease contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   When under subsections (2) or (3) and (4) a lessor or a lessee of accessions holds an interest that is superior to all interests in the whole, the lessor or the lessee may (i) on default, expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease contract by the other party but subject to the provisions of the lease contract and this article, or (ii) if necessary to enforce his or her other rights and remedies under this article, remove the goods from the whole, free and clear of all interests in the whole, but he or she must reimburse any holder of an interest in the whole who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury but not for any diminution in value of the whole caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity for replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Between merchants, the reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of any assurance offered must be determined according to commercial standards.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Damages payable by either party for default, or any other act or omission, including indemnity for loss or diminution of anticipated tax benefits or loss or damage to lessor's residual interest, may be liquidated in the lease agreement but only at an amount or by a formula that is reasonable in light of the then anticipated harm caused by the default or other act or omission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the lease agreement provides for liquidation of damages, and such provision does not comply with subsection (1), or such provision is an exclusive or limited remedy that circumstances cause to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this article.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the lessor justifiably withholds or stops delivery of goods because of the lessee's default or insolvency (section 2A525 or 2A526), the lessee is entitled to restitution of any amount by which the sum of his or her payments exceeds either of the following: </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An action for default under a lease contract, including breach of warranty or indemnity, must be commenced within 4 years after the cause of action accrued. By the original lease contract the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than 1 year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A cause of action for default accrues when the act or omission on which the default or breach of warranty is based is or should have been discovered by the aggrieved party, or when the default occurs, whichever is later. A cause of action for indemnity accrues when the act or omission on which the claim for indemnity is based is or should have been discovered by the indemnified party, whichever is later.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If evidence of rent for the use of the goods concerned for a lease term identical to the remaining lease term of the original lease agreement and prevailing at the times or places described in this article is not readily available, the rent prevailing within any reasonable time before or after the time described or at any other place or for a different lease term which in commercial judgment or under usage of trade would serve as a reasonable substitute for the one described may be used, making any proper allowance for the difference, including the cost of transporting the goods to or from the other place.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Evidence of a relevant rent prevailing at a time or place or for a lease term other than the one described in this article offered by 1 party is not admissible unless and until he or she has given the other party notice the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the prevailing rent or value of any goods regularly leased in any established market is in issue, reports in official publications or trade journals or in newspapers or periodicals of general circulation published as the reports of that market are admissible in evidence.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Cancel the lease contract (section 2A505(1)). </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Recover so much of the rent and security as has been paid and is just under the circumstances.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Under an installment lease contract a lessee may reject any delivery that is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that delivery and cannot be cured or the nonconformity is a defect in the required documents; but if the nonconformity does not fall within subsection (2) and the lessor or the supplier gives adequate assurance of its cure, the lessee must accept that delivery.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Whenever nonconformity or default with respect to 1 or more deliveries substantially impairs the value of the installment lease contract as a whole there is a default with respect to the whole. But, the aggrieved party reinstates the installment lease contract as a whole if the aggrieved party accepts a nonconforming delivery without seasonably notifying of cancellation or brings an action with respect only to past deliveries or demands performance as to future deliveries.</DIV>

In the absence of those instructions, a merchant lessee shall make reasonable efforts to sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of the goods for the lessor's account if they threaten to decline in value speedily. Instructions are not reasonable if on demand indemnity for expenses is not forthcoming. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a merchant lessee or any other lessee (section 2A512) disposes of goods, he or she is entitled to reimbursement either from the lessor or the supplier or out of the proceeds for reasonable expenses of caring for and disposing of the goods and, if the expenses include no disposition commission, to such commission as is usual in the trade, or if there is none, to a reasonable sum not exceeding 10% of the gross proceeds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In complying with this section or section 2A512, the lessee is held only to good faith. Good faith conduct hereunder is neither acceptance or conversion nor the basis of an action for damages.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A purchaser who purchases in good faith from a lessee pursuant to this section or section 2A512 takes the goods free of any rights of the lessor and the supplier even though the lessee fails to comply with 1 or more of the requirements of this article.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the lessor or the supplier gives no instructions within a reasonable time after notification of rejection, the lessee may store the rejected goods for the lessor's or the supplier's account or ship them to the lessor or the supplier or dispose of them for the lessor's or the supplier's account with reimbursement in the manner provided in section 2A511.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the lessee rejects a nonconforming tender that the lessor or the supplier had reasonable grounds to believe would be acceptable with or without money allowance, the lessor or the supplier may have a further reasonable time to substitute a conforming tender if he or she seasonably notifies the lessee.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2A516.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A lessee must pay rent for any goods accepted in accordance with the lease contract, with due allowance for goods rightfully rejected or not delivered.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A lessee's acceptance of goods precludes rejection of the goods accepted. In the case of a finance lease, if made with knowledge of a nonconformity, acceptance cannot be revoked because of it. In any other case, if made with knowledge of a nonconformity, acceptance cannot be revoked because of it unless the acceptance was on the reasonable assumption that the nonconformity would be seasonably cured. Acceptance does not of itself impair any other remedy provided by this article or the lease agreement for nonconformity. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a tender has been accepted:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Within a reasonable time after the lessee discovers or should have discovered any default, the lessee shall notify the lessor and the supplier, if any, or be barred from any remedy against the party not notified. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Except in the case of a consumer lease, within a reasonable time after the lessee receives notice of litigation for infringement or the like (section 2A211), the lessee shall notify the lessor or be barred from any remedy over for liability established by the litigation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The burden is on the lessee to establish any default.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a lessee is sued for breach of a warranty or other obligation for which a lessor or a supplier is answerable over the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The lessee may give the lessor or the supplier, or both, written notice of the litigation. If the notice states that the person notified may come in and defend and that if the person notified does not do so that person will be bound in any action against that person by the lessee by any determination of fact common to the 2 litigations, then unless the person notified after seasonable receipt of the notice does come in and defend that person is so bound.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The lessor or the supplier may demand in writing that the lessee turn over control of the litigation including settlement if the claim is one for infringement or the like (section 2A211) or else be barred from any remedy over. If the demand states that the lessor or the supplier agrees to bear all expense and to satisfy any adverse judgment, then unless the lessee after seasonable receipt of the demand does turn over control the lessee is so barred.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Subsections (3) and (4) apply to any obligation of a lessee to hold the lessor or the supplier harmless against infringement or the like (section 2A211).</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2A517.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unit whose nonconformity substantially impairs its value to the lessee if the lessee has accepted it:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Except in the case of a finance lease, on the reasonable assumption that its nonconformity would be cured and it has not been seasonably cured.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Without discovery of the nonconformity if the lessee's acceptance was reasonably induced either by the lessor's assurances or, except in the case of a finance lease, by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except in the case of a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, a lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unit if the lessor defaults under the lease contract and the default substantially impairs the value of that lot or commercial unit to the lessee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the lease agreement so provides, the lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unit because of other defaults by the lessor. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the lessee discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused by the nonconformity. Revocation is not effective until the lessee notifies the lessor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A lessee who so revokes has the same rights and duties with regard to the goods involved as if the lessee had rejected them.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Drawee" means a person ordered in a draft to make payment.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) "Ordinary care" in the case of a person engaged in business means observance of reasonable commercial standards, prevailing in the area in which the person is located, with respect to the business in which the person is engaged. In the case of a bank that takes an instrument for processing for collection or payment by automated means, reasonable commercial standards do not require the bank to examine the instrument if the failure to examine does not violate the bank's prescribed procedures and the bank's procedures do not vary unreasonably from general banking usage not disapproved by this article or article 4.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) "Promise" means a written undertaking to pay money signed by the person undertaking to pay. An acknowledgment of an obligation by the obligor is not a promise unless the obligor also undertakes to pay the obligation. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) "Prove" with respect to a fact means to meet the burden of establishing the fact under section 1201(2)(h).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) "Remitter" means a person who purchases an instrument from its issuer if the instrument is payable to an identified person other than the purchaser.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) "Remotely created consumer item" means an item drawn on a consumer account, which is not created by the payor bank and does not bear a handwritten signature purporting to be the signature of the drawer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(o) "Secondary obligor", with respect to an instrument, means any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) An indorser or an accommodation party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A drawer that has the obligation described in section 3414(4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Any other party to the instrument that has recourse against another party to the instrument under section 3116(2).</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3104.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4), "negotiable instrument" means an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges described in the promise or order, if all of the following apply: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   It is payable to bearer or to order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   It is payable on demand or at a definite time.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   It does not state any other undertaking or instruction by the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition to the payment of money, but the promise or order may contain an undertaking or power to give, maintain, or protect collateral to secure payment, an authorization or power to the holder to confess judgment or realize on or dispose of collateral, or a waiver of the benefit of any law intended for the advantage or protection of an obligor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   "Instrument" means a negotiable instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   An order that meets all of the requirements of subsection (1), except subdivision (a), and otherwise falls within the definition of "check" in subsection (6) is a negotiable instrument and a check. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A promise or order other than a check is not an instrument if, at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the effect that the promise or order is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this article.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   An instrument is a "note" if it is a promise and is a "draft" if it is an order. If an instrument falls within the definition of both "note" and "draft", a person entitled to enforce the instrument may treat it as either.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   "Check" means a draft, other than a documentary draft, payable on demand and drawn on a bank or a cashier's check or teller's check. An instrument may be a check even though it is described on its face by another term, such as "money order".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   "Cashier's check" means a draft with respect to which the drawer and drawee are the same bank or branches of the same bank. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   "Teller's check" means a draft drawn by a bank on another bank, or payable at or through a bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   "Traveler's check" means an instrument that is payable on demand, is drawn on or payable at or through a bank, is designated by the term "traveler's check" or by a substantially similar term, and requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   "Certificate of deposit" means an instrument containing an acknowledgment by a bank that a sum of money has been received by the bank and a promise by the bank to repay the sum of money. A certificate of deposit is a note of the bank.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 3105.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    "Issue" means the first delivery of an instrument by the maker or drawer, whether to a holder or nonholder, for the purpose of giving rights on the instrument to any person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An unissued instrument, or an unissued incomplete instrument that is completed, is binding on the maker or drawer, but nonissuance is a defense. An instrument that is conditionally issued or is issued for a special purpose is binding on the maker or drawer, but failure of the condition or special purpose to be fulfilled is a defense.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   "Issuer" applies to issued and unissued instruments and means a maker or drawer of an instrument.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in this section, for the purposes of section 3104(1), a promise or order is unconditional unless it states 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An express condition to payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That the promise or order is subject to or governed by another record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) That rights or obligations with respect to the promise or order are stated in another record. A reference to another record does not of itself make the promise or order conditional.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A promise or order is not made conditional by or because of either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) By a reference to another record for a statement of rights with respect to collateral, prepayment, or acceleration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Because payment is limited to resort to a particular fund or source.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a promise or order requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the promise or order, the condition does not make the promise or order conditional for the purposes of section 3104(1). If the person whose specimen signature appears on an instrument fails to countersign the instrument, the failure to countersign is a defense to the obligation of the issuer, but the failure does not prevent a transferee of the instrument from becoming a holder of the instrument.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a promise or order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder contains a statement, required by applicable statutory or administrative law, to the effect that the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to claims or defenses that the issuer could assert against the original payee, the promise or order is not thereby made conditional for the purposes of section 3104(1); but if the promise or order is an instrument, there cannot be a holder in due course of the instrument.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3110.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The person to whom an instrument is initially payable is determined by the intent of the person, whether or not authorized, signing as, or in the name or behalf of, the issuer of the instrument. The instrument is payable to the person intended by the signer even if that person is identified in the instrument by a name or other identification that is not that of the intended person. If more than 1 person signs in the name or behalf of the issuer of an instrument and all the signers do not intend the same person as payee, the instrument is payable to any person intended by 1 or more of the signers.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the signature of the issuer of an instrument is made by automated means, such as a check-writing machine, the payee of the instrument is determined by the intent of the person who supplied the name or identification of the payee, whether or not authorized to do so.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A person to whom an instrument is payable may be identified in any way, including by name, identifying number, office, or account number. For the purpose of determining the holder of an instrument, the following rules apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If an instrument is payable to an account and the account is identified only by number, the instrument is payable to the person to whom the account is payable. If an instrument is payable to an account identified by number and by the name of a person, the instrument is payable to the named person, whether or not that person is the owner of the account identified by number.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If an instrument is payable to any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   A trust, an estate, or a person described as trustee or representative of a trust or estate, the instrument is payable to the trustee, the representative, or a successor of either, whether or not the beneficiary or estate is also named.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)    A person described as agent or similar representative of a named or identified person, the instrument is payable to the represented person, the representative, or a successor of the representative.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)    A fund or organization that is not a legal entity, the instrument is payable to a representative of the members of the fund or organization. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)    An office or to a person described as holding an office, the instrument is payable to the named person, the incumbent of the office, or a successor to the incumbent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If an instrument is payable to 2 or more persons alternatively, it is payable to any of them and may be negotiated, discharged, or enforced by any or all of them in possession of the instrument. If an instrument is payable to 2 or more persons not alternatively, it is payable to all of them and may be negotiated, discharged, or enforced only by all of them. If an instrument payable to 2 or more persons is ambiguous as to whether it is payable to the persons alternatively, the instrument is payable to the persons alternatively. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except for negotiation by a remitter, if an instrument is payable to an identified person, negotiation requires transfer of possession of the instrument and its endorsement by the holder.

<P>Sec. 3203.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    An instrument is transferred when it is delivered by a person other than its issuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Transfer of an instrument, whether or not the transfer is a negotiation, vests in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, including any right as a holder in due course, but the transferee cannot acquire rights of a holder in due course by a transfer, directly or indirectly, from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud or illegality affecting the instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Unless otherwise agreed, if an instrument is transferred for value and the transferee does not become a holder because of lack of endorsement by the transferor, the transferee has a specifically enforceable right to the unqualified endorsement of the transferor, but negotiation of the instrument does not occur until the endorsement is made.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a transferor purports to transfer less than the entire instrument, negotiation of the instrument does not occur. The transferee obtains no rights under this article and has only the rights of a partial assignee. </DIV>

<P>Sec. 3204.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    "Endorsement" means a signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer, or acceptor, that alone or accompanied by other words is made on an instrument for the purpose of (i) negotiating the instrument, (ii) restricting payment of the instrument, or (iii) incurring endorser's liability on the instrument, but regardless of the intent of the signer, a signature and its accompanying words is an endorsement unless the accompanying words, terms of the instrument, place of the signature, or other circumstances unambiguously indicate that the signature was made for a purpose other than endorsement. For the purpose of determining whether a signature is made on an instrument, a paper affixed to the instrument is a part of the instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   "Endorser" means a person who makes an endorsement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   For the purpose of determining whether the transferee of an instrument is a holder, an endorsement that transfers a security interest in the instrument is effective as an unqualified endorsement of the instrument. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If an instrument is payable to a holder under a name that is not the name of the holder, endorsement may be made by the holder in the name stated in the instrument or in the holder's name or both, but signature in both names may be required by a person paying or taking the instrument for value or collection.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    If an endorsement is made by the holder of an instrument, whether payable to an identified person or payable to bearer, and the endorsement identifies a person to whom it makes the instrument payable, it is a "special endorsement". When specially endorsed, an instrument becomes payable to the identified person and may be negotiated only by the endorsement of that person. The principles stated in section 3110 apply to special endorsements. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If an endorsement is made by the holder of an instrument and it is not a special endorsement, it is a "blank endorsement". When endorsed in blank, an instrument becomes payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone until specially endorsed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The holder may convert a blank endorsement that consists only of a signature into a special endorsement by writing, above the signature of the endorser, words identifying the person to whom the instrument is made payable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   "Anomalous endorsement" means an endorsement made by a person who is not the holder of the instrument. An anomalous endorsement does not affect the manner in which the instrument may be negotiated.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3206.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    An endorsement limiting payment to a particular person or otherwise prohibiting further transfer or negotiation of the instrument is not effective to prevent further transfer or negotiation of the instrument. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An endorsement stating a condition to the right of the endorsee to receive payment does not affect the right of the endorsee to enforce the instrument. A person paying the instrument or taking it for value or collection may disregard the condition, and the rights and liabilities of that person are not affected by whether the condition has been fulfilled.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If an instrument bears an endorsement (i) described in section 4201(2), or (ii) in blank or to a particular bank using the words "for deposit", "for collection", or other words indicating a purpose of having the instrument collected by a bank for the endorser or for a particular account, the following rules apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A person, other than a bank, who purchases the instrument when so endorsed converts the instrument unless the amount paid for the instrument is received by the endorser or applied consistently with the endorsement. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A depositary bank that purchases the instrument or takes it for collection when so endorsed converts the instrument unless the amount paid by the bank with respect to the instrument is received by the endorser or applied consistently with the endorsement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A payor bank that is also the depositary bank or that takes the instrument for immediate payment over the counter from a person other than a collecting bank converts the instrument unless the proceeds of the instrument are received by the endorser or applied consistently with the endorsement. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (c), a payor bank or intermediary bank may disregard the endorsement and is not liable if the proceeds of the instrument are not received by the endorser or applied consistently with the endorsement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Except for an endorsement covered by subsection (3), if an instrument bears an endorsement using words to the effect that payment is to be made to the endorsee as agent, trustee, or other fiduciary for the benefit of the endorser or another person, the following rules apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Unless there is notice of breach of fiduciary duty as provided in section 3307, a person who purchases the instrument from the endorsee or takes the instrument from the endorsee for collection or payment may pay the proceeds of the payment or the value given for the instrument to the endorsee without regard to whether the endorsee violates a fiduciary duty to the endorser.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A subsequent transferee of the instrument or person who pays the instrument is neither given notice nor otherwise affected by the restriction in the endorsement unless the transferee or payor knows that the fiduciary dealt with the instrument or its proceeds in breach of fiduciary duty.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The presence on an instrument of an endorsement to which this section applies does not prevent a purchaser of the instrument from becoming a holder in due course of the instrument unless the purchaser is a converter under subsection (3) or has notice or knowledge of breach of fiduciary duty as stated in subsection (4).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   In an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the obligor has a defense if payment would violate an endorsement to which this section applies and the payment is not permitted by this section.</DIV>

A former holder who reacquires the instrument may cancel endorsements made after the reacquirer first became a holder of the instrument.

</P>
<P>Sec. 3302.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Subject to subsection (3) and section 3106(4), "holder in due course" means the holder of an instrument if both of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The instrument when issued or negotiated to the holder does not bear such apparent evidence of forgery or alteration or is not otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The holder took the instrument (i) for value, (ii) in good faith, (iii) without notice that the instrument is overdue or has been dishonored or that there is an incurred default with respect to payment of another instrument issued as part of the same series, (iv) without notice that the instrument contains an unauthorized signature or has been altered, (v) without notice of any claim to the instrument described in section 3306, and (vi) without notice that any party has a defense or claim in recoupment described in section 3305(1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Notice of discharge of a party, other than discharge in an insolvency proceeding, is not notice of a defense under subsection (1), but discharge is effective against a person who became a holder in due course with notice of the discharge. Public filing or recording of a document does not of itself constitute notice of a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except to the extent a transferor or predecessor in interest has rights as a holder in due course, a person does not acquire rights of a holder in due course of an instrument taken (i) by legal process or by purchase in an execution, bankruptcy, or creditor's sale or similar proceeding, (ii) by purchase as part of a bulk transaction not in ordinary course of business of the transferor, or (iii) as the successor in interest to an estate or other organization.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If under section 3303(1)(a) the promise of performance that is the consideration for an instrument has been partially performed, the holder may assert rights as a holder in due course of the instrument only to the fraction of the amount payable under the instrument equal to the value of the partial performance divided by the value of the promised performance. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If (i) the person entitled to enforce an instrument has only a security interest in the instrument and (ii) the person obliged to pay the instrument has a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument that may be asserted against the person who granted the security interest, the person entitled to enforce the instrument may assert rights as a holder in due course only to an amount payable under the instrument which, at the time of enforcement of the instrument, does not exceed the amount of the unpaid obligation secured. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   To be effective, notice must be received at a time and in a manner that gives a reasonable opportunity to act on it.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    An instrument is issued or transferred for value if any of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The instrument is issued or transferred for a promise of performance, to the extent the promise has been performed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The transferee acquires a security interest or other lien in the instrument other than a lien obtained by judicial proceeding.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The instrument is issued or transferred as payment of, or as security for, an antecedent claim against any person, whether or not the claim is due.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for a negotiable instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for the incurring of an irrevocable obligation to a third party by the person taking the instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   "Consideration" means any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. The drawer or maker of an instrument has a defense if the instrument is issued without consideration. If an instrument is issued for a promise of performance, the issuer has a defense to the extent performance of the promise is due and the promise has not been performed.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the right to enforce the obligation of a party to pay an instrument is subject to the following: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A defense of the obligor based on (i) infancy of the obligor to the extent it is a defense to a simple contract, (ii) duress, lack of legal capacity, or illegality of the transaction which, under other law, nullifies the obligation of the obligor, (iii) fraud that induced the obligor to sign the instrument with neither knowledge nor reasonable opportunity to learn of its character or its essential terms, or (iv) discharge of the obligor in insolvency proceedings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A defense of the obligor stated in another section of this article or a defense of the obligor that would be available if the person entitled to enforce the instrument were enforcing a right to payment under a simple contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A claim in recoupment of the obligor against the original payee of the instrument if the claim arose from the transaction that gave rise to the instrument, but the claim of the obligor may be asserted against a transferee of the instrument only to reduce the amount owing on the instrument at the time the action is brought.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The right of a holder in due course to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument is subject to defenses of the obligor stated in subsection (1)(a), but is not subject to defenses of the obligor stated in subsection (1)(b) or claims in recoupment stated in subsection (1)(c) against a person other than the holder.</div>

An obligor is not obliged to pay the instrument if the person seeking enforcement of the instrument does not have rights of a holder in due course and the obligor proves that the instrument is a lost or stolen instrument.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In an action to enforce the obligation of an accommodation party to pay an instrument, the accommodation party may assert against the person entitled to enforce the instrument any defense or claim in recoupment under subsection (1) that the accommodated party could assert against the person entitled to enforce the instrument, except the defenses of discharge in insolvency proceedings, infancy, and lack of legal capacity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) In a consumer transaction, if law other than this article requires that an instrument include a statement to the effect that the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to a claim or defense that the issuer could assert against the original payee, and the instrument does not include such a statement, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The instrument has the same effect as if the instrument included such a statement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The issuer may assert against the holder or transferee all claims and defenses that would have been available if the instrument included such a statement.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    As used in this section:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Fiduciary" means an agent, trustee, partner, corporate officer or director, or other representative owing a fiduciary duty with respect to an instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Represented person" means the principal, beneficiary, partnership, corporation, or other person to whom the duty stated in subdivision (a) is owned.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If (i) an instrument is taken from a fiduciary for payment or collection or for value, (ii) the taker has knowledge of the fiduciary status of the fiduciary, and (iii) the represented person makes a claim to the instrument or its proceeds on the basis that the transaction of the fiduciary is a breach of fiduciary duty, the following rules apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Notice of breach of fiduciary duty by the fiduciary is notice of the claim of the represented person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   In the case of an instrument payable to the represented person or the fiduciary as such, the taker has notice of the breach of fiduciary duty if the instrument is (i) taken in payment of or as security for a debt known by the taker to be the personal debt of the fiduciary, (ii) taken in a transaction known by the taker to be for the personal benefit of the fiduciary, or (iii) deposited to an account other than an account of the fiduciary, as such, or an account of the represented person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If an instrument is issued by the represented person or the fiduciary as such, and made payable to the fiduciary personally, the taker does not have notice of the breach of fiduciary duty unless the taker knows of the breach of fiduciary duty.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3308.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    In an action with respect to an instrument, the authenticity of, and authority to make, each signature on the instrument is admitted unless specifically denied in the pleadings. If the validity of a signature is denied in the pleadings, the burden of establishing validity is on the person claiming validity, but the signature is presumed to be authentic and authorized unless the action is to enforce the liability of the purported signer and the signer is dead or incompetent at the time of trial of the issue of validity of the signature. If an action to enforce the instrument is brought against a person as the undisclosed principal of a person who signed the instrument as a party to the instrument, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the defendant is liable on the instrument as a represented person under section 3402(1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the validity of signatures is admitted or proved and there is compliance with subsection (1), a plaintiff producing the instrument is entitled to payment if the plaintiff proves entitlement to enforce the instrument under section 3301, unless the defendant proves a defense or claim in recoupment. If a defense or claim in recoupment is proved, the right to payment of the plaintiff is subject to the defense or claim, except to the extent the plaintiff proves that the plaintiff has rights of a holder in due course which are not subject to the defense or claim.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The person meets either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Was entitled to enforce the instrument when loss of possession occurred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Has directly or indirectly acquired ownership of the instrument from a person that was entitled to enforce the instrument when loss of possession occurred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The loss of possession was not the result of a transfer by the person or a lawful seizure. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The person cannot reasonably obtain possession of the instrument because the instrument was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot be determined, or it is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a person that cannot be found or is not amenable to service of process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A person seeking enforcement of an instrument under subsection (1) must prove the terms of the instrument and the person's right to enforce the instrument.

The court may not enter judgment in favor of the person seeking enforcement unless it finds that the person required to pay the instrument is adequately protected against loss that might occur by reason of a claim by another person to enforce the instrument. Adequate protection may be provided by any reasonable means.</div>

<P>Sec. 3310.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Unless otherwise agreed, if a certified check, cashier's check, or teller's check is taken for an obligation, the obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result if an amount of money equal to the amount of the instrument were taken in payment of the obligation. Discharge of the obligation does not affect any liability that the obligor may have as an endorser of the instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Unless otherwise agreed and except as provided in subsection (1), if a note or an uncertified check is taken for an obligation, the obligation is suspended to the same extent the obligation would be discharged if an amount of money equal to the amount of the instrument were taken, and the following rules apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   In the case of an uncertified check, suspension of the obligation continues until dishonor of the check or until it is paid or certified. Payment or certification of the check results in discharge of the obligation to the extent of the amount of the check.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   In the case of a note, suspension of the obligation continues until dishonor of the note or until it is paid. Payment of the note results in discharge of the obligation to the extent of the payment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Except as provided in subdivision (d), if the check or note is dishonored and the obligee of the obligation for which the instrument was taken is the person entitled to enforce the instrument, the obligee may enforce either the instrument or the obligation. In the case of an instrument of a third person which is negotiated to the obligee by the obligor, discharge of the obligor on the instrument also discharges the obligation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   If the person entitled to enforce the instrument taken for an obligation is a person other than the obligee, the obligee may not enforce the obligation to the extent the obligation is suspended. If the obligee is the person entitled to enforce the instrument but no longer has possession of it because it was lost, stolen, or destroyed, the obligation may not be enforced to the extent of the amount payable on the instrument, and to that extent the obligee's rights against the obligor are limited to enforcement of the instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If an instrument other than one described in subsection (1) or (2) is taken for an obligation, the effect is (i) that stated in subsection (1) if the instrument is one on which a bank is liable as maker or acceptor, or (ii) that stated in subsection (2) in any other case.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Unless subsection (3) applies, the claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that the instrument or an accompanying written communication contained a conspicuous statement to the effect that the instrument was tendered as full satisfaction of the claim.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Subject to subsection (4), a claim is not discharged under subsection (2) if either of the following applies:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The claimant, if an organization, proves that (i) within a reasonable time before the tender, the claimant sent a conspicuous statement to the person against whom the claim is asserted that communications concerning disputed debts, including an instrument tendered as full satisfaction of a debt, are to be sent to a designated person, office, or place, and (ii) the instrument or accompanying communication was not received by that designated person, office, or place. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The claimant, whether or not an organization, proves that within 90 days after payment of the instrument, the claimant tendered repayment of the amount of the instrument to the person against whom the claim is asserted. This subdivision does not apply if the claimant is an organization that sent a statement complying with subdivision (a)(i). </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that within a reasonable time before collection of the instrument was initiated, the claimant, or an agent of the claimant having direct responsibility with respect to the disputed obligation, knew that the instrument was tendered in full satisfaction of the claim.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As used in this section:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Claimant" means a person who claims the right to receive the amount of a cashier's check, teller's check, or certified check that was lost, destroyed, or stolen.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Declaration of loss" means a statement, made in a record under penalty of perjury, to the effect that all of the following apply: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The declarer lost possession of a check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The declarer is the drawer or payee of the check in the case of a certified check, or the remitter or payee of the check in the case of a cashier's check or teller's check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The loss of possession was not the result of a transfer by the declarer or a lawful seizure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The declarer cannot reasonably obtain possession of the check because the check was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot be determined, or it is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a person that cannot be found or is not amenable to service of process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Obligated bank" means the issuer of a cashier's check or teller's check or the acceptor of a certified check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A claimant may assert a claim to the amount of a check by a communication to the obligated bank describing the check with reasonable certainty and requesting payment of the amount of the check if all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The claimant is the drawer or payee of a certified check or the remitter or payee of a cashier's check or teller's check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The communication contains or is accompanied by a declaration of loss of the claimant with respect to the check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The communication is received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable time to act on it before the check is paid. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The claimant provides reasonable identification if requested by the obligated bank.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Delivery of a declaration of loss is a warranty of the truth of the statements made in the declaration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a claim is asserted in compliance with subsection (2), the following rules apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The claim becomes enforceable at the later of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The time the claim is asserted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The 90th day following the date of the check in the case of a cashier's check or teller's check, or the 90th day following the date of the acceptance in the case of a certified check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Until the claim becomes enforceable, it has no legal effect and the obligated bank may pay the check or, in the case of a teller's check, may permit the drawee to pay the check.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the claim becomes enforceable before the check is presented for payment, the obligated bank is not obliged to pay the check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) When the claim becomes enforceable, the obligated bank becomes obliged to pay the amount of the check to the claimant if payment of the check has not been made to a person entitled to enforce the check. Subject to section 4302(1)(a), payment to the claimant discharges all liability of the obligated bank with respect to the check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the obligated bank pays the amount of a check to a claimant under subsection (4)(d) and the check is presented for payment by a person having rights of a holder in due course, the claimant is obliged to do both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Refund the payment to the obligated bank if the check is paid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Pay the amount of the check to the person having rights of a holder in due course if the check is dishonored.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a claimant has the right to assert a claim under subsection (2) and is also a person entitled to enforce a cashier's check, teller's check, or certified check which is lost, destroyed, or stolen, the claimant may assert rights with respect to the check either under this section or section 3309.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    If a person acting, or purporting to act, as a representative signs an instrument by signing either the name of the represented person or the name of the signer, the represented person is bound by the signature to the same extent the represented person would be bound if the signature were on a simple contract. If the represented person is bound, the signature of the representative is the "authorized signature of the represented person" and the represented person is liable on the instrument, whether or not identified in the instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a representative signs the name of the representative to an instrument and the signature is an authorized signature of the represented person, the following rules apply:</DIV>

With respect to any other person, the representative is liable on the instrument unless the representative proves that the original parties did not intend the representative to be liable on the instrument.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 3404.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    If an imposter, by use of the mails or otherwise, induces the issuer of an instrument to issue the instrument to the imposter, or to a person acting in concert with the imposter, by impersonating the payee of the instrument or a person authorized to act for the payee, an endorsement of the instrument by any person in the name of the payee is effective as the endorsement of the payee in favor of a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If (i) a person whose intent determines to whom an instrument is payable in section 3110(1) or (2) does not intend the person identified as payee to have any interest in the instrument, or (ii) the person identified as payee of an instrument is a fictitious person, the following rules apply until the instrument is negotiated by special endorsement:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Any person in possession of the instrument is its holder.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   An endorsement by any person in the name of the payee stated in the instrument is effective as the endorsement of the payee in favor of a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Under subsection (1) or (2), an endorsement is made in the name of a payee if (i) it is made in a name substantially similar to that of the payee or (ii) the instrument, whether or not endorsed, is deposited in a depositary bank to an account in a name substantially similar to that of the payee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   With respect to an instrument to which subsection (1) or (2) applies, if a person paying the instrument or taking it for value or for collection fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss resulting from payment of the instrument, the person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Employee" includes an independent contractor and employee of an independent contractor retained by the employer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Fraudulent endorsement" means (i) in the case of an instrument payable to the employer, a forged endorsement purporting to be that of the employer, or (ii) in the case of an instrument with respect to which the employer is the issuer, a forged endorsement purporting to be that of the person identified as payee. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   "Responsibility" with respect to instruments means authority (i) to sign or endorse instruments on behalf of the employer, (ii) to process instruments received by the employer for bookkeeping purposes, for deposit to an account, or for other disposition, (iii) to prepare or process instruments for issue in the name of the employer, (iv) to supply information determining the names or addresses of payees of instruments to be issued in the name of the employer, (v) to control the disposition of instruments to be issued in the name of the employer, or (vi) to act otherwise with respect to instruments in a responsible capacity. "Responsibility" does not include authority that merely allows an employee to have access to instruments or blank or incomplete instrument forms that are being stored or transported or are part of incoming or outgoing mail, or similar access. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For the purpose of determining the rights and liabilities of a person who, in good faith, pays an instrument or takes it for value or for collection, if an employer entrusted an employee with responsibility with respect to the instrument and the employee or a person acting in concert with the employee makes a fraudulent endorsement of the instrument, the endorsement is effective as the endorsement of the person to whom the instrument is payable if it is made in the name of that person. If the person paying the instrument or taking it for value or for collection fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss resulting from the fraud, the person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Under subsection (2), an endorsement is made in the name of the person to whom an instrument is payable if (i) it is made in a name substantially similar to the name of that person or (ii) the instrument, whether or not endorsed, is deposited in a depositary bank to an account in a name substantially similar to the name of that person.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Under subsection (1), if the person asserting the preclusion fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss, the loss is allocated between the person precluded and the person asserting the preclusion according to the extent to which the failure of each to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Under subsection (1), the burden of proving failure to exercise ordinary care is on the person asserting the preclusion. Under subsection (2), the burden of proving failure to exercise ordinary care is on the person precluded.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as provided in subsection (3), an alteration fraudulently made discharges a party whose obligation is affected by the alteration unless that party assents or is precluded from asserting the alteration. No other alteration discharges a party, and the instrument may be enforced according to its original terms.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A payor bank or drawee paying a fraudulently altered instrument or a person taking it for value, in good faith and without notice of the alteration, may enforce rights with respect to the instrument (i) according to its original terms, or (ii) in the case of an incomplete instrument altered by unauthorized completion, according to its terms as completed.</DIV>

Acceptance may be made at any time and becomes effective when notification pursuant to instructions is given or the accepted draft is delivered for the purpose of giving rights on the acceptance to any person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A draft may be accepted although it has not been signed by the drawer, is otherwise incomplete, is overdue, or has been dishonored. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   "Certified check" means a check accepted by the bank on which it is drawn. Acceptance may be made as stated in subsection (1) or by a writing on the check which indicates that the check is certified.

The right of the drawee to recover damages under this subsection is not affected by any failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in making payment.

Rights of the drawee under this subsection are not affected by failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in paying or accepting the draft.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as provided in subsection (3), if an instrument has been paid or accepted by mistake and the case is not covered by subsection (1), the person paying or accepting may, to the extent permitted by the law governing mistake and restitution, (i) recover the payment from the person to whom or for whose benefit payment was made or (ii) in the case of acceptance, may revoke the acceptance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The remedies provided by subsection (1) or (2) may not be asserted against a person who took the instrument in good faith and for value or who in good faith changed position in reliance on the payment or acceptance. This subsection does not limit remedies provided by section 3417 or 4407.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Notwithstanding section 4215, if an instrument is paid or accepted by mistake and the payor or acceptor recovers payment or revokes acceptance under subsection (1) or (2), the instrument is deemed not to have been paid or accepted and is treated as dishonored, and the person from whom payment is recovered has rights as a person entitled to enforce the dishonored instrument. </DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If an instrument is issued for value given for the benefit of a party to the instrument ("accommodated party") and another party to the instrument ("accommodation party") signs the instrument for the purpose of incurring liability on the instrument without being a direct beneficiary of the value given for the instrument, the instrument is signed by the accommodation party "for accommodation".</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An accommodation party may sign the instrument as maker, drawer, acceptor, or endorser and, subject to subsection (4), is obliged to pay the instrument in the capacity in which the accommodation party signs. The obligation of an accommodation party may be enforced notwithstanding any statute of frauds and whether or not the accommodation party receives consideration for the accommodation. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A person signing an instrument is presumed to be an accommodation party and there is notice that the instrument is signed for accommodation if the signature is an anomalous endorsement or is accompanied by words indicating that the signer is acting as surety or guarantor with respect to the obligation of another party to the instrument. Except as provided in section 3605, the obligation of an accommodation party to pay the instrument is not affected by the fact that the person enforcing the obligation had notice when the instrument was taken by that person that the accommodation party signed the instrument for accommodation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the signature of a party to an instrument is accompanied by words indicating unambiguously that the party is guaranteeing collection rather than payment of the obligation of another party to the instrument, the signer is obliged to pay the amount due on the instrument to a person entitled to enforce the instrument only if (i) execution of judgment against the other party has been returned unsatisfied, (ii) the other party is insolvent or in an insolvency proceeding, (iii) the other party cannot be served with process, or (iv) it is otherwise apparent that payment cannot be obtained from the other party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the signature of a party to an instrument is accompanied by words indicating that the party guarantees payment or the signer signs the instrument as an accommodation party in some other manner that does not unambiguously indicate an intention to guarantee collection rather than payment, the signer is obliged to pay the amount due on the instrument to a person entitled to enforce the instrument in the same circumstances as the accommodated party would be obliged, without prior resort to the accommodated party by the person entitled to enforce the instrument.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An accommodation party who pays the instrument is entitled to reimbursement from the accommodated party and is entitled to enforce the instrument against the accommodated party. In proper circumstances, an accommodation party may obtain relief that requires the accommodated party to perform its obligations on the instrument. An accommodated party that pays the instrument has no right of recourse against, and is not entitled to contribution from, an accommodation party.</div>

<P>Sec. 3420.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The law applicable to conversion of personal property applies to instruments. An instrument is also converted if it is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation, from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment. An action for conversion of an instrument may not be brought by (i) the issuer or acceptor of the instrument or (ii) a payee or endorsee who did not receive delivery of the instrument either directly or through delivery to an agent or a co-payee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In an action under subsection (1), the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument, but recovery may not exceed the amount of the plaintiff's interest in the instrument. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A representative, other than a depository bank, who has in good faith dealt with an instrument or its proceeds on behalf of one who was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument is not liable in conversion to that person beyond the amount of any proceeds that it has not paid out. </DIV>

<P>Sec. 3501.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    "Presentment" means a demand made by or on behalf of a person entitled to enforce an instrument (i) to pay the instrument made to the drawee or a party obliged to pay the instrument or, in the case of a note or accepted draft payable at a bank, to the bank, or (ii) to accept a draft made to the drawee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The following rules are subject to article 4, agreement of the parties, and clearinghouse rules and the like:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Presentment may be made at the place of payment of the instrument and must be made at the place of payment if the instrument is payable at a bank in the United States; may be made by any commercially reasonable means, including an oral, written, or electronic communication; is effective when the demand for payment or acceptance is received by the person to whom presentment is made; and is effective if made to any 1 of 2 or more makers, acceptors, drawees, or other payors.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Upon demand of the person to whom presentment is made, the person making presentment must (i) exhibit the instrument, (ii) give reasonable identification and, if presentment is made on behalf of another person, reasonable evidence of authority to do so, and (iii) sign a receipt on the instrument for any payment made or surrender the instrument if full payment is made.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Without dishonoring the instrument, the party to whom presentment is made may (i) return the instrument for lack of a necessary endorsement, or (ii) refuse payment or acceptance for failure of the presentment to comply with the terms of the instrument, an agreement of the parties, or other applicable law or rule.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The party to whom presentment is made may treat presentment as occurring on the next business day after the day of presentment if the party to whom presentment is made has established a cutoff hour not earlier than 2 p.m. for the receipt and processing of instruments presented for payment or acceptance and presentment is made after the cutoff hour.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Dishonor of a note is governed by the following rules:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the note is payable on demand, the note is dishonored if presentment is duly made to the maker and the note is not paid on the date of presentment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the note is not payable on demand and is payable at or through a bank or the terms of the note require presentment, the note is dishonored if presentment is duly made and the note is not paid on the day it becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If the note is not payable on demand and subdivision (b) does not apply, the note is dishonored if it is not paid on the day it becomes payable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Dishonor of an unaccepted draft other than a documentary draft is governed by the following rules:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If a check is duly presented for payment to the payor bank otherwise than for immediate payment over the counter, the check is dishonored if the payor bank makes timely return of the check or sends timely notice of dishonor or nonpayment under section 4301 or 4302, or becomes accountable for the amount of the check under section 4302.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If a draft is payable on demand and subdivision (a) does not apply, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the drawee and the draft is not paid on the day of presentment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If a draft is payable on a date stated in the draft, the draft is dishonored if (i) presentment for payment is duly made to the drawee and payment is not made on the day the draft becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later, or (ii) presentment for acceptance is duly made before the day the draft becomes payable and the draft is not accepted on the day of presentment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   If a draft is payable on elapse of a period of time after sight or acceptance, the draft is dishonored if presentment for acceptance is duly made and the draft is not accepted on the day of presentment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Dishonor of an unaccepted documentary draft occurs according to the rules stated in subsection (2)(b), (c), and (d), except that payment or acceptance may be delayed without dishonor until no later than the close of the third business day of the drawee following the day on which payment or acceptance is required by those paragraphs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Dishonor of an accepted draft is governed by the following rules:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the draft is payable on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the acceptor and the draft is not paid on the day of presentment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the draft is not payable on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the acceptor and payment is not made on the day it becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   In any case in which presentment is otherwise required for dishonor under this section and presentment is excused under section 3504, dishonor occurs without presentment if the instrument is not duly accepted or paid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If a draft is dishonored because timely acceptance of the draft was not made and the person entitled to demand acceptance consents to a late acceptance, from the time of acceptance the draft is treated as never having been dishonored.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Notice of dishonor may be given by any person; may be given by any commercially reasonable means, including an oral, written, or electronic communication; and is sufficient if it reasonably identifies the instrument and indicates that the instrument has been dishonored or has not been paid or accepted. Return of an instrument given to a bank for collection is sufficient notice of dishonor. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Subject to section 3504(3), with respect to an instrument taken for collection by a collecting bank, notice of dishonor must be given (i) by the bank before midnight of the next banking day following the banking day on which the bank receives notice of dishonor of the instrument, or (ii) by any other person within 30 days following the day on which the person receives notice of dishonor.

A notification is adequate only if it is signed by the transferor or the transferee; reasonably identifies the transferred note; and provides an address at which payments subsequently are to be made. Upon request, a transferee shall seasonably furnish reasonable proof that the note has been transferred.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Any obligations of the principal obligor to the secondary obligor with respect to any previous payment by the secondary obligor are not affected. Unless the terms of the extension preserve the secondary obligor's recourse, the extension correspondingly extends the time for performance of any other duties owed to the secondary obligor by the principal obligor under this article.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) To the extent that the secondary obligor is not discharged under subdivision (b), the secondary obligor may satisfy its obligation on the instrument as if the modification had not occurred, or treat its obligation on the instrument as having been modified correspondingly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the obligation of a principal obligor is secured by an interest in collateral, another party to the instrument is a secondary obligor with respect to that obligation, and a person entitled to enforce the instrument impairs the value of the interest in collateral, the obligation of the secondary obligor is discharged to the extent of the impairment. The value of an interest in collateral is impaired to the extent the value of the interest is reduced to an amount less than the amount of the recourse of the secondary obligor, or the reduction in value of the interest causes an increase in the amount by which the amount of the recourse exceeds the value of the interest. For purposes of this subsection, impairing the value of an interest in collateral includes failure to obtain or maintain perfection or recordation of the interest in collateral, release of collateral without substitution of collateral of equal value or equivalent reduction of the underlying obligation, failure to perform a duty to preserve the value of collateral owed, under article 9 or other law, to a debtor or other person secondarily liable, and failure to comply with applicable law in disposing of or otherwise enforcing the interest in collateral.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A secondary obligor is not discharged under subsection (1)(c), (2), (3), or (4) unless the person entitled to enforce the instrument knows that the person is a secondary obligor or has notice under section 3419(3) that the instrument was signed for accommodation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A secondary obligor is not discharged under this section if the secondary obligor consents to the event or conduct that is the basis of the discharge, or the instrument or a separate agreement of the party provides for waiver of discharge under this section specifically or by general language indicating that parties waive defenses based on suretyship or impairment of collateral. Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, consent by the principal obligor to an act that would lead to a discharge under this section constitutes consent to that act by the secondary obligor if the secondary obligor controls the principal obligor or deals with the person entitled to enforce the instrument on behalf of the principal obligor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A release or extension preserves a secondary obligor's recourse if the terms of the release or extension provide both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That the person entitled to enforce the instrument retains the right to enforce the instrument against the secondary obligor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That the recourse of the secondary obligor continues as if the release or extension had not been granted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (9), a secondary obligor asserting discharge under this section has the burden of persuasion both with respect to the occurrence of the acts alleged to harm the secondary obligor and loss or prejudice caused by those acts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the secondary obligor demonstrates prejudice caused by an impairment of its recourse, and the circumstances of the case indicate that the amount of loss is not reasonably susceptible of calculation or requires proof of facts that are not ascertainable, it is presumed that the act impairing recourse caused a loss or impairment equal to the liability of the secondary obligor on the instrument. In that event, the burden of persuasion as to any lesser amount of the loss is on the person entitled to enforce the instrument.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The liability of a bank for action or non-action with respect to an item handled by it for purposes of presentment, payment, or collection is governed by the law of the place where the bank is located.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The effect of the provisions of this article may be varied by agreement but the parties to the agreement cannot disclaim a bank's responsibility for its lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care or limit the measure of damages for the lack or failure. However, the parties may determine by agreement the standards by which the bank's responsibility is to be measured if those standards are not manifestly unreasonable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Federal Reserve regulations and operating circulars, clearing-house rules, and the like have the effect of agreements under subsection (1), whether or not specifically assented to by all parties interested in items handled.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Action or non-action approved by this article or pursuant to Federal Reserve regulations or operating circulars is the exercise of ordinary care and, in the absence of special instructions, action or non-action consistent with clearing-house rules and the like or with a general banking usage not disapproved by this article, is prima facie the exercise of ordinary care.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The specification or approval of certain procedures by this article is not disapproval of other procedures which may be reasonable under the circumstances.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The measure of damages for failure to exercise ordinary care in handling an item is the amount of the item reduced by an amount that could not have been realized by the exercise of ordinary care.

<P>Sec. 4201.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Unless a contrary intent clearly appears and before the time that a settlement given by a collecting bank for an item is or becomes final, the bank, with respect to the item, is an agent or sub-agent of the owner of the item and any settlement given for the item is provisional. This provision applies regardless of the form of indorsement or lack of indorsement and even though credit given for the item is subject to immediate withdrawal as of right or is in fact withdrawn; but the continuance of ownership of an item by its owner and any rights of the owner to proceeds of the item are subject to rights of a collecting bank, such as those resulting from outstanding advances on the item and rights of setoff. If an item is handled by banks for purposes of presentment, payment, collection, or return, the relevant provisions of this article apply even though action of parties clearly establishes that a particular bank has purchased the item and is the owner of it.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   After an item has been indorsed with the words "pay any bank" or the like, only a bank may acquire the rights of a holder until the item has been either of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Returned to the customer initiating collection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Specially endorsed by a bank to a person who is not a bank.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Presenting an item or sending it for presentment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Sending notice of dishonor or nonpayment or returning an item other than a documentary draft to the bank's transferor after learning that the item has not been paid or accepted, as the case may be.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Settling for an item when the bank receives final settlement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Notifying its transferor of any loss or delay in transit within a reasonable time after discovery thereof.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A collecting bank exercises ordinary care under subsection (1) by taking proper action before its midnight deadline following receipt of an item, notice, or settlement. Taking proper action within a reasonably longer time may constitute the exercise of ordinary care, but the bank has the burden of establishing timeliness.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    If a collecting bank has made provisional settlement with its customer for an item and itself fails by reason of dishonor, suspension of payments by a bank or otherwise to receive a settlement for the item which is or becomes final, the bank may revoke the settlement given by it, charge back the amount of any credit given for the item to its customer's account or obtain refund from its customer whether or not it is able to return the items if by its midnight deadline or within a longer reasonable time after it learns the facts it returns the item or sends notification of the facts.

</P>
<P>Sec. 4401.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    A bank may charge against the account of a customer an item that is properly payable from that account even though the charge creates an overdraft. An item is properly payable if it is authorized by the customer and is in accordance with any agreement between the customer and bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A customer is not liable for the amount of an overdraft if the customer neither signed the item nor benefited from the proceeds of the item.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A bank may charge against the account of a customer a check that is otherwise properly payable from the account, even though payment was made before the date of the check, unless the customer has given notice to the bank of the postdating describing the check with reasonable certainty. The notice is effective for the period stated in section 4403(2) for stop-payment orders, and must be received at such time and in such manner as to afford the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the bank takes any action with respect to the check described in section 4303. If a bank charges against the account of a customer a check before the date stated in the notice of postdating, the bank is liable for damages for the loss resulting from its act. The loss may include damages for dishonor of subsequent items under section 4402.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A bank that in good faith makes payment to a holder may charge the indicated account of its customer according to either of the following: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The original terms of the altered item.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The terms of the completed item, even though the bank knows the item has been completed unless the bank has notice that the completion was improper.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4402.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Except as otherwise provided in this article, a payor bank wrongfully dishonors an item if it dishonors an item that is properly payable, but a bank may dishonor an item that would create an overdraft unless it has agreed to pay the overdraft.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A payor bank is liable to its customer for damages proximately caused by the wrongful dishonor of an item. Liability is limited to actual damages proved and may include damages for an arrest or prosecution of the customer or other consequential damages. Whether any consequential damages are proximately caused by the wrongful dishonor is a question of fact to be determined in each case.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A payor bank's determination of the customer's account balance on which a decision to dishonor for insufficiency of available funds is based may be made at any time between the time the item is received by the payor bank and the time that the payor bank returns the item or gives notice in lieu of return, and no more than 1 determination need be made. If, at the election of the payor bank, a subsequent balance determination is made for the purpose of reevaluating the bank's decision to dishonor the item, the account balance at that time is determinative of whether a dishonor for insufficiency of available funds is wrongful.</DIV>

If the signature of more than 1 person is required to draw on an account, any of these persons may stop payment or close the account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A stop-payment order is effective for 6 months, but it lapses after 14 calendar days if the original order was oral and was not confirmed in a record within that period. A stop-payment order may be renewed for additional 6-month periods by a record given to the bank within a period during which the stop-payment order is effective.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The burden of establishing the fact and amount of loss resulting from the payment of an item contrary to a stop-payment order or order to close an account is on the customer.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A bank is under no obligation to a customer having a checking account to pay a check, other than a certified check, which is presented more than 6 months after its date, but it may charge its customer's account for a payment made thereafter in good faith.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4405.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    A payor or collecting bank's authority to accept, pay or collect an item or to account for proceeds of its collection if otherwise effective is not rendered ineffective by incompetence of a customer of either bank existing at the time the item is issued or its collection is undertaken if the bank does not know of an adjudication of incompetence. Neither death nor incompetence of a customer revokes such authority to accept, pay, collect or account until the bank knows of the fact of death or of an adjudication of incompetence and has reasonable opportunity to act on it.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4406.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    A bank that sends or makes available to a customer a statement of account showing payment of items for the account shall either return or make available to the customer the items paid or provide information in the statement of account sufficient to allow the customer reasonably to identify the items paid. The statement of account provides sufficient information if the item is described by item number, amount, and date of payment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the items are not returned to the customer, the person retaining the items shall either retain the items or, if the items are destroyed, maintain the capacity to furnish legible copies of the items until the expiration of 7 years after receipt of the items. A customer may request an item from the bank that paid the item, and that bank must provide in a reasonable time either the item or, if the item has been destroyed or is not otherwise obtainable, a legible copy of the item.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a bank sends or makes available a statement of account or items pursuant to subsection (1), the customer must exercise reasonable promptness in examining the statement or the items to determine whether any payment was not authorized because of an alteration of an item or because a purported signature by or on behalf of the customer was not authorized. If, based on the statement or items provided, the customer should reasonably have discovered the unauthorized payment, the customer must promptly notify the bank of the relevant facts.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the bank proves that the customer failed, with respect to an item, to comply with the duties imposed on the customer by subsection (3), the customer is precluded from asserting against the bank the following: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The customer's unauthorized signature or any alteration on the item, if the bank also proves that it suffered a loss by reason of the failure.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The customer's unauthorized signature or alteration by the same wrongdoer on any other item paid in good faith by the bank if the payment was made before the bank received notice from the customer of the unauthorized signature or alteration and after the customer had been afforded a reasonable period of time, not exceeding 30 days, in which to examine the item or statement of account and notify the bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If subsection (4) applies and the customer proves that the bank failed to exercise ordinary care in paying the item and that the failure substantially contributed to loss, the loss is allocated between the customer precluded and the bank asserting the preclusion according to the extent to which the failure of the customer to comply with subsection (3) and the failure of the bank to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss. If the customer proves that the bank did not pay the item in good faith, the preclusion under subsection (4) does not apply.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Without regard to care or lack of care of either the customer or the bank, a customer who does not within 1 year after the statement or items are made available to the customer (subsection (1)) discover and report his or her unauthorized signature on or any alteration on the item is precluded from asserting against the bank the unauthorized signature or alteration. If there is a preclusion under this subsection, the payor bank may not recover for breach of warranty under section 4208 with respect to the unauthorized signature or alteration to which the preclusion applies.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The time of receipt of a payment order or communication canceling or amending a payment order is determined by the rules applicable to receipt of a notice stated in section 1202. A receiving bank may fix a cut-off time or times on a funds transfer business day for the receipt and processing of payment orders and communications canceling or amending payment orders. Different cut-off times may apply to payment orders, cancellations, or amendments, or to different categories of payment orders, cancellations, or amendments. A cut-off time may apply to senders generally or different cut-off times may apply to different senders or categories of payment orders. If a payment order or communication canceling or amending a payment order is received after the close of a funds transfer business day or after the appropriate cut-off time on a funds transfer business day, the receiving bank may treat the payment order or communication as received at the opening of the next funds transfer business day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If this article refers to an execution date or payment date or states a day on which a receiving bank is required to take action, and the date or day does not fall on a funds transfer business day, the next day that is a funds transfer business day is treated as the date or day stated, unless the contrary is stated in this article.</div>

<P>Sec. 4A201.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Security procedure" means a procedure established by agreement of a customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying that a payment order or communication amending or canceling a payment order is that of the customer, or (ii) detecting error in the transmission of the content of the payment order or communication. A security procedure may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices. Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen signature of the customer is not by itself a security procedure.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4A202.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A payment order received by the receiving bank is the authorized order of the person identified as sender if that person authorized the order or is otherwise bound by it under the law of agency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment orders issued to the bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order received by the receiving bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if (i) the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing security against unauthorized payment orders, and (ii) the bank proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the security procedure and any written agreement or instruction of the customer restricting acceptance of payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not required to follow an instruction that violates a written agreement with the customer or notice of which is not received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the payment order is accepted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the size, type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the bank, alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly situated. A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if (i) the security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that customer, and (ii) the customer expressly agreed in writing to be bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and accepted by the bank in compliance with the security procedure chosen by the customer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The term "sender" in this article includes the customer in whose name a payment order is issued if the order is the authorized order of the customer under subsection (1), or it is effective as the order of the customer under subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   This section applies to amendments and cancellations of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Except as provided in this section and in section 4A203(1)(a), rights and obligations arising under this section or section 4A203 may not be varied by agreement. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   By express written agreement, the receiving bank may limit the extent to which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The receiving bank is not entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order if the customer proves that the order was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a person (i) entrusted at anytime with duties to act for the customer with respect to payment orders or the security procedure, or (ii) who obtained access to transmitting facilities of the customer or who obtained, from a source controlled by the customer and without authority of the receiving bank, information facilitating breach of the security procedure, regardless of how the information was obtained or whether the customer was at fault.

However, the customer is not entitled to interest from the bank on the amount to be refunded if the customer fails to exercise ordinary care to determine that the order was not authorized by the customer and to notify the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time not exceeding 90 days after the date the customer received notification from the bank that the order was accepted or that the customer's account was debited with respect to the order.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If an accepted payment order was transmitted pursuant to a security procedure for the detection of error and the payment order (i) erroneously instructed payment to a beneficiary not intended by the sender, (ii) erroneously instructed payment in an amount greater than the amount intended by the sender, or (iii) was an erroneously transmitted duplicate of a payment order previously sent by the sender, the following rules apply: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the sender proves that the sender or a person acting on behalf of the sender pursuant to section 4A206 complied with the security procedure and that the error would have been detected if the receiving bank had also complied, the sender is not obliged to pay the order to the extent stated in subdivisions (b) and (c).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the funds transfer is completed on the basis of an erroneous payment order described in subsection (1)(i) or (iii), the sender is not obliged to pay the order and the receiving bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If the funds transfer is completed on the basis of a payment order described in subsection (1)(ii), the sender is not obliged to pay the order to the extent the amount received by the beneficiary is greater than the amount intended by the sender. In that case, the receiving bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary the excess amount received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If (i) the sender of an erroneous payment order described in subsection (1) is not obliged to pay all or part of the order, and (ii) the sender receives notification from the receiving bank that the order was accepted by the bank or that the sender's account was debited with respect to the order, the sender has a duty to exercise ordinary care, on the basis of information available to the sender, to discover the error with respect to the order and to advise the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time, not exceeding 90 days, after the bank's notification was received by the sender. If the bank proves that the sender failed to perform that duty, the sender is liable to the bank for the loss the bank proves it incurred as a result of the failure, but the liability of the sender may not exceed the amount of the sender's order.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a payment order addressed to a receiving bank is transmitted to a funds-transfer system or other third-party communication system for transmittal to the bank, the system is deemed to be an agent of the sender for the purpose of transmitting the payment order to the bank.

<P>Sec. 4A207.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Subject to subsection (2), if, in a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank, the name, bank account number, or other identification of the beneficiary refers to a nonexistent or unidentifiable person or account, no person has rights as a beneficiary of the order and acceptance of the order cannot occur.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank identifies the beneficiary both by name and by an identifying or bank account number and the name and number identify different persons, the following rules apply: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3), if the beneficiary's bank does not know that the name and number refer to different persons, it may rely on the number as the proper identification of the beneficiary of the order. The beneficiary's bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by name or knows that the name and number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the person paid by the beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the originator of the funds transfer. If no person has rights as beneficiary, acceptance of the order cannot occur.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If (i) a payment order described in subsection (2) is accepted, (ii) the originator's payment order described the beneficiary inconsistently by name and number, and (iii) the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by number as permitted by subsection (2)(a), the following rules apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified by number was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator's bank proves that the originator, before acceptance of the originator's order, had notice that payment of a payment order issued by the originator might be made by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of an identifying or bank account number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the originator is obliged to pay its payment order as stated in subsection (3), the originator has the right to recover.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The following rules apply to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank only by an identifying number: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank and need not determine whether the number identifies a bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The following rules apply to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank both by name and an identifying number if the name and number identify different persons.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, when it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person or whether the number refers to a bank. The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, had notice that the receiving bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving bank are governed by subsection (2)(a), as though the sender were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The receiving bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing stating the information to which the notice relates.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Regardless of whether the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the name as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, at the time it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4A209.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Subject to subsection (4), a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order when it executes the order. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Subject to subsections (3) and (4), a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order at the earliest of the following times:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   When the bank pays the beneficiary as stated in section 4A405(1) or (2), or notifies the beneficiary of receipt of the order or that the account of the beneficiary has been credited with respect to the order unless the notice indicates that the bank is rejecting the order or that funds with respect to the order may not be withdrawn or used until receipt of payment from the sender of the order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   When the bank receives payment of the entire amount of the sender's order pursuant to section 4A403(1)(a) or (b).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The opening of the next funds-transfer business day of the bank following the payment date of the order if, at that time, the amount of the sender's order is fully covered by a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the sender or the bank has otherwise received full payment from the sender, unless the order was rejected before that time or is rejected within 1 hour after that time, or 1 hour after the opening of the next business day of the sender following the payment date if that time is later. If notice of rejection is received by the sender after the payment date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the payment date to the day the sender receives notice or learns that the order was not accepted, counting that day as an elapsed day. If the withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest payable is reduced accordingly. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Acceptance of a payment order cannot occur before the order is received by the receiving bank. Acceptance does not occur under subsection (2)(b) or (c) if the beneficiary of the payment order does not have an account with the receiving bank, the account has been closed, or the receiving bank is not permitted by law to receive credits for the beneficiary's account. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A payment order issued to the originator's bank cannot be accepted until the payment date if the bank is the beneficiary's bank, or the execution date if the bank is not the beneficiary's bank. If the originator's bank executes the originator's payment order before the execution date or pays the beneficiary of the originator's payment order before the payment date and the payment order is subsequently canceled pursuant to section 4A211(2), the bank may recover from the beneficiary any payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4A210.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a notice of rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically, or in writing. A notice of rejection need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or will not execute or pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is given by a means that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the notice is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes the means to be used to reject a payment order, any means complying with the agreement is reasonable and any means not complying is not reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice resulted from the use of the noncomplying means.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   This subsection applies if a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank fails to execute a payment order despite the existence on the execution date of a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the sender sufficient to cover the order. If the sender does not receive notice of rejection of the order on the execution date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the execution date to the earlier of the day the order is canceled pursuant to section 4A211(4) or the day the sender receives notice or learns that the order was not executed, counting the final day of the period as an elapsed day. If the withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest is reduced accordingly.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a receiving bank suspends payments, all unaccepted payment orders issued to it are deemed rejected at the time the bank suspends payments. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Acceptance of a payment order precludes a later rejection of the order. Rejection of a payment order precludes a later acceptance of the order.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4A211.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A communication of the sender of a payment order canceling or amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally, electronically, or in writing. If a security procedure is in effect between the sender and the receiving bank, the communication is not effective to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified pursuant to the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Subject to subsection (1), a communication by the sender canceling or amending a payment order is effective to cancel or amend the order if notice of the communication is received at a time and in a manner affording the receiving bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the communication before the bank accepts the payment order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   After a payment order has been accepted, cancellation, or amendment of the order is not effective unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment without agreement of the bank. With respect to a payment order, the following rules apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A payment order accepted by a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, cancellation, or amendment is not effective unless a conforming cancellation or amendment of the payment order issued by the receiving bank is also made.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, cancellation, or amendment is not effective unless the order was issued in execution of an unauthorized payment order, or because of a mistake by a sender in the funds transfer which resulted in the issuance of a payment order that is a duplicate of a payment order previously issued by the sender, that orders payment to a beneficiary not entitled to receive payment from the originator, or that orders payment in an amount greater than the amount the beneficiary was entitled to receive from the originator. If the payment order is canceled or amended, the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   An unaccepted payment order is canceled by operation of law at the close of the fifth funds-transfer business day of the receiving bank after the execution date or payment date of the order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A canceled payment order cannot be accepted. If an accepted payment order is canceled, the acceptance is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance. Amendment of a payment order is deemed to be cancellation of the original order at the time of amendment and issue of a new payment order in the amended form at the same time.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Unless otherwise provided in an agreement of the parties or in a funds-transfer system rule, if the receiving bank, after accepting a payment order, agrees to cancellation or amendment of the order by the sender or is bound by a funds-transfer system rule allowing cancellation or amendment without the bank's agreement, the sender, whether or not cancellation or amendment is effective, is liable to the bank for any loss and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by the bank as a result of the cancellation or amendment or attempted cancellation or amendment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A payment order is not revoked by the death or legal incapacity of the sender unless the receiving bank knows of the death or of an adjudication of incapacity by a court of competent jurisdiction and has reasonable opportunity to act before acceptance of the order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   A funds-transfer system rule is not effective to the extent it conflicts with subsection (3)(b).</DIV>

<P>Sec. 4A212.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If a receiving bank fails to accept a payment order that it is obliged by express agreement to accept, the bank is liable for breach of the agreement to the extent provided in the agreement or in this article, but does not otherwise have any duty to accept a payment order or, before acceptance, to take any action, or refrain from taking action, with respect to the order except as provided in this article or by express agreement. Liability based on acceptance arises only when acceptance occurs as stated in section 4A209, and liability is limited to that provided in this article. A receiving bank is not the agent of the sender or beneficiary of the payment order it accepts, or of any other party to the funds transfer, and the bank owes no duty to any party to the funds transfer except as provided in this article or by express agreement.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 4A301.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A payment order is "executed" by the receiving bank when it issues a payment order intended to carry out the payment order received by the bank. A payment order received by the beneficiary's bank can be accepted but cannot be executed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   "Execution date" of a payment order means the day on which the receiving bank may properly issue a payment order in execution of the sender's order. The execution date may be determined by instruction of the sender but cannot be earlier than the day the order is received and, unless otherwise determined, is the day the order is received. If the sender's instruction states a payment date, the execution date is the payment date or an earlier date on which execution is reasonably necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4A302.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as provided in subsections (2) through (4), if the receiving bank accepts a payment order pursuant to section 4A209(1), the bank has the following obligations in executing the order:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The receiving bank is obliged to issue, on the execution date, a payment order complying with the sender's order and to follow the sender's instructions concerning any intermediary bank or funds-transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer, or the means by which payment orders are to be transmitted in the funds transfer. If the originator's bank issues a payment order to an intermediary bank, the originator's bank is obliged to instruct the intermediary bank according to the instruction of the originator. An intermediary bank in the funds transfer is similarly bound by an instruction given to it by the sender of the payment order it accepts.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the sender's instruction states that the funds transfer is to be carried out telephonically or by wire transfer or otherwise indicates that the funds transfer is to be carried out by the most expeditious means, the receiving bank is obliged to transmit its payment order by the most expeditious available means, and to instruct any intermediary bank accordingly. If a sender's instruction states a payment date, the receiving bank is obliged to transmit its payment order at a time and by means reasonably necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date or as soon thereafter as is feasible.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Unless otherwise instructed, a receiving bank executing a payment order may use any funds-transfer system if use of that system is reasonable in the circumstances, and issue a payment order to the beneficiary's bank or to an intermediary bank through which a payment order conforming to the sender's order can expeditiously be issued to the beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank exercises ordinary care in the selection of the intermediary bank. A receiving bank is not required to follow an instruction of the sender designating a funds-transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer if the receiving bank, in good faith, determines that it is not feasible to follow the instruction or that following the instruction would unduly delay completion of the funds transfer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Unless subsection (1)(b) applies or the receiving bank is otherwise instructed, the bank may execute a payment order by transmitting its payment order by first-class mail or by any means reasonable in the circumstances. If the receiving bank is instructed to execute the sender's order by transmitting its payment order by a particular means, the receiving bank may issue its payment order by the means stated or by any means as expeditious as the means stated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Unless instructed by the sender, the receiving bank may not obtain payment of its charges for services and expenses in connection with the execution of the sender's order by issuing a payment order in an amount equal to the amount of the sender's order less the amount of the charges, and may not instruct a subsequent receiving bank to obtain payment of its charges in the same manner.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4A303.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A receiving bank that executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order in an amount greater than the amount of the sender's order, or issues a payment order in execution of the sender's order and then issues a duplicate order, is entitled to payment of the amount of the sender's order under section 4A402(3) if that subsection is otherwise satisfied. The bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary of the erroneous order the excess payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A receiving bank that executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order in an amount less than the amount of the sender's order is entitled to payment of the amount of the sender's order under section 4A402(3) if that subsection is otherwise satisfied and the bank corrects its mistake by issuing an additional payment order for the benefit of the beneficiary of the sender's order. If the error is not corrected, the issuer of the erroneous order is entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of the order it accepted only to the extent of the amount of the erroneous order. This subsection does not apply if the receiving bank executes the sender's payment order by issuing a payment order in an amount less than the amount of the sender's order for the purpose of obtaining payment of its charges for services and expenses pursuant to instruction of the sender.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a receiving bank executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order to a beneficiary different from the beneficiary of the sender's order and the funds transfer is completed on the basis of that error, the sender of the payment order that was erroneously executed and all previous senders in the funds transfer are not obliged to pay the payment orders they issued. The issuer of the erroneous order is entitled to recover from the beneficiary of the order the payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If the sender of a payment order that is erroneously executed as stated in section 4A303 receives notification from the receiving bank that the order was executed or that the sender's account was debited with respect to the order, the sender has a duty to exercise ordinary care to determine, on the basis of information available to the sender, that the order was erroneously executed and to notify the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time not exceeding 90 days after the notification from the bank was received by the sender. If the sender fails to perform that duty, the bank is not obliged to pay interest on any amount refundable to the sender under section 4A402(4) for the period before the bank learns of the execution error. The bank is not entitled to any recovery from the sender on account of a failure by the sender to perform the duty stated in this section.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 4A305.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a funds transfer is completed but execution of a payment order by the receiving bank in breach of section 4A302 results in delay in payment to the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to pay interest to either the originator or the beneficiary of the funds transfer for the period of delay caused by the improper execution. Except as provided in subsection (3), additional damages are not recoverable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If execution of a payment order by a receiving bank in breach of section 4A302 results in noncompletion of the funds transfer, failure to use an intermediary bank designated by the originator, or issuance of a payment order that does not comply with the terms of the payment order of the originator, the bank is liable to the originator for its expenses in the funds transfer and for incidental expenses and interest losses, to the extent not covered by subsection (1), resulting from the improper execution. Except as provided in subsection (3), additional damages are not recoverable.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Reasonable attorney's fees are recoverable if demand for compensation under subsection (1) or (2) is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim.

</P>
<P>Sec. 4A402.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   This section is subject to sections 4A205 and 4A207. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   With respect to a payment order issued to the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the order by the bank obliges the sender to pay the bank the amount of the order, but payment is not due until the payment date of the order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   This subsection is subject to subsection (5) and to section 4A303. With respect to a payment order issued to a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the order by the receiving bank obliges the sender to pay the bank the amount of the sender's order. Payment by the sender is not due until the execution date of the sender's order. The obligation of that sender to pay its payment order is excused if the funds transfer is not completed by acceptance by the beneficiary's bank of a payment order instructing payment to the beneficiary of that sender's payment order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the sender of a payment order pays the order and was not obliged to pay all or part of the amount paid, the bank receiving payment is obliged to refund payment to the extent the sender was not obliged to pay. Except as provided in sections 4A204 and 4A304, interest is payable on the refundable amount from the date of payment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a funds transfer is not completed as stated in subsection (3) and an intermediary bank is obliged to refund payment as stated in subsection (4) but is unable to do so because not permitted by applicable law or because the bank suspends payments, a sender in the funds transfer that executed a payment order in compliance with an instruction, as stated in section 4A302(1)(a), to route the funds transfer through that intermediary bank is entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of the payment order that it accepted. The first sender in the funds transfer that issued an instruction requiring routing through that intermediary bank is subrogated to the right of the bank that paid the intermediary bank to refund as stated in subsection (4).</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4A403.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Payment of the sender's obligation under section 4A402 to pay the receiving bank occurs as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the sender is a bank, payment occurs when the receiving bank receives final settlement of the obligation through a federal reserve bank or through a funds-transfer system.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the sender is a bank and the sender (i) credited an account of the receiving bank with the sender, or (ii) caused an account of the receiving bank in another bank to be credited, payment occurs when the credit is withdrawn or, if not withdrawn, at midnight of the day on which the credit is withdrawable and the receiving bank learns of that fact.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If the receiving bank debits an account of the sender with the receiving bank, payment occurs when the debit is made to the extent the debit is covered by a withdrawable credit balance in the account. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the sender and receiving bank are members of a funds-transfer system that nets obligations multilaterally among participants, the receiving bank receives final settlement when settlement is complete in accordance with the rules of the system. The obligation of the sender to pay the amount of a payment order transmitted through the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to the extent permitted by the rules of the system, by setting off and applying against the sender's obligation the right of the sender to receive payment from the receiving bank of the amount of any other payment order transmitted to the sender by the receiving bank through the funds-transfer system. The aggregate balance of obligations owed by each sender to each receiving bank in the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to the extent permitted by the rules of the system, by setting off and applying against that balance the aggregate balance of obligations owed to the sender by other members of the system. The aggregate balance is determined after the right of setoff stated in the second sentence of this subsection has been exercised.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If 2 banks transmit payment orders to each other under an agreement that settlement of the obligations of each bank to the other under section 4A402 will be made at the end of the day or other period, the total amount owed with respect to all orders transmitted by 1 bank shall be set off against the total amount owed with respect to all orders transmitted by the other bank. To the extent of the setoff, each bank has made payment to the other.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In a case not covered by subsection (1), the time when payment of the sender's obligation under section 4A402(2) or (3) occurs is governed by applicable principles of law that determine when an obligation is satisfied.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4A404.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Subject to sections 4A211(5), 4A405(4), and 4A405(5), if a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order, the bank is obliged to pay the amount of the order to the beneficiary of the order. Payment is due on the payment date of the order, but if acceptance occurs on the payment date after the close of the funds-transfer business day of the bank, payment is due on the next funds-transfer business day. If the bank refuses to pay after demand by the beneficiary and receipt of notice of particular circumstances that will give rise to consequential damages as a result of nonpayment, the beneficiary may recover damages resulting from the refusal to pay to the extent the bank had notice of the damages, unless the bank proves that it did not pay because of a reasonable doubt concerning the right of the beneficiary to payment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank instructs payment to an account of the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to notify the beneficiary of receipt of the order before midnight of the next funds-transfer business day following the payment date. If the payment order does not instruct payment to an account of the beneficiary, the bank is required to notify the beneficiary only if notice is required by the order. Notice may be given by first-class mail or any other means reasonable in the circumstances. If the bank fails to give the required notice, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the beneficiary on the amount of the payment order from the day notice should have been given until the day the beneficiary learned of receipt of the payment order by the bank. No other damages are recoverable. Reasonable attorney's fees are also recoverable if demand for interest is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The right of a beneficiary to receive payment and damages as stated in subsection (1) may not be varied by agreement or a funds-transfer system rule. The right of a beneficiary to be notified as stated in subsection (2) may be varied by agreement of the beneficiary or by a funds-transfer system rule if the beneficiary is notified of the rule before initiation of the funds transfer.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4A405.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the beneficiary's bank credits an account of the beneficiary of a payment order, payment of the bank's obligation under section 4A404(1) occurs when and to the extent (i) the beneficiary is notified of the right to withdraw the credit, (ii) the bank lawfully applies the credit to a debt of the beneficiary, or (iii) funds with respect to the order are otherwise made available to the beneficiary by the bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the beneficiary's bank does not credit an account of the beneficiary of a payment order, the time when payment of the bank's obligation under section 4A404(1) occurs is governed by principles of law that determine when an obligation is satisfied.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as stated in subsections (4) and (5), if the beneficiary's bank pays the beneficiary of a payment order under a condition to payment or agreement of the beneficiary giving the bank the right to recover payment from the beneficiary if the bank does not receive payment of the order, the condition to payment or agreement is not enforceable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A funds-transfer system rule may provide that payments made to beneficiaries of funds transfers made through the system are provisional until receipt of payment by the beneficiary's bank of the payment order is accepted. A beneficiary's bank that makes a payment that is provisional under the rule is entitled to refund from the beneficiary if (i) the rule requires that both the beneficiary and the originator be given notice of the provisional nature of the payment before the funds transfer is initiated, (ii) the beneficiary, the beneficiary's bank, and the originator's bank agreed to be bound by the rule, and (iii) the beneficiary's bank did not receive payment of the payment order that it accepted. If the beneficiary is obliged to refund payment to the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the payment order by the beneficiary's bank is nullified and no payment by the originator of the funds transfer to the beneficiary occurs under section 4A406.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   This subsection applies to the funds transfer that includes a payment order transmitted over a funds-transfer system that (i) nets obligations multilaterally among participants, and (ii) has in effect a loss-sharing agreement among participants for the purpose of providing funds necessary to complete settlement of the obligations of 1 or more participants that do not meet their settlement obligations. If the beneficiary's bank in the funds transfer accepts a payment order and the system fails to complete settlement pursuant to its rules with respect to any payment order in the funds transfer, (i) the acceptance by the beneficiary's bank is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance, (ii) the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover payment from the beneficiary, (iii) no payment by the originator to the beneficiary occurs under section 4A406, and (iv) subject to section 4A402(5), each sender in the funds transfer is excused from its obligation to pay its payment order under section 4A402(3) because the funds transfer has not been completed.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 4A406.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Subject to sections 4A211(5), 4A405(4), and 4A405(5), the originator of a funds transfer pays the beneficiary of the originator's payment order (i) at the time a payment order for the benefit of the beneficiary is accepted by the beneficiary's bank in the funds transfer and (ii) in an amount equal to the amount of the order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, but not more than the amount of the originator's order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If payment under subsection (1) is made to satisfy an obligation, the obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result from payment to the beneficiary of the same amount in money, unless (i) the payment under subsection (1) was made by a means prohibited by the contract of the beneficiary with respect to the obligation, (ii) the beneficiary, within a reasonable time after receiving notice of receipt of the order by the beneficiary's bank, notified the originator of the beneficiary's refusal of the payment, (iii) funds with respect to the order were not withdrawn by the beneficiary or applied to a debt of the beneficiary, and (iv) the beneficiary would suffer a loss that could reasonably have been avoided if payment had been made by a means complying with the contract. If payment by the originator does not result in discharge under this section, the originator is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary to receive payment from the beneficiary's bank under section 4A404(1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   For the purpose of determining whether discharge of an obligation occurs under subsection (2), if the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order in an amount equal to the amount of the originator's payment order less charges of 1 or more receiving banks in the funds transfer, payment to the beneficiary is deemed to be in the amount of the originator's order unless upon demand by the beneficiary the originator does not pay the beneficiary the amount of the deducted charges.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   As used in this section, "creditor process" means levy, attachment, garnishment, notice of lien, sequestration, or similar process issued by or on behalf of a creditor or other claimant with respect to an account.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   This subsection applies to creditor process with respect to an authorized account of the sender of a payment order if the creditor process is served on the receiving bank. For the purpose of determining rights with respect to the creditor process, if the receiving bank accepts that payment order the balance in the authorized account is deemed to be reduced by the amount of the payment order to the extent the bank did not otherwise receive payment of the order, unless the creditor process is served at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the bank accepts the payment order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a beneficiary's bank has received a payment order for payment to the beneficiary's account in the bank, the following rules apply: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The bank may credit the beneficiary's account. The amount credited may be set off against an obligation owed by the beneficiary to the bank or may be applied to satisfy creditor process served on the bank with respect to the account.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The bank may credit the beneficiary's account and allow withdrawal of the amount credited unless creditor process with respect to the account is served at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act to prevent withdrawal.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If creditor process with respect to the beneficiary's account has been served and the bank has had a reasonable opportunity to act on it, the bank may not reject the payment order except for a reason unrelated to the service of process.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Creditor process with respect to a payment by the originator to the beneficiary pursuant to a funds transfer may be served only on the beneficiary's bank with respect to the debt owed by that bank to the beneficiary. Any other bank served with the creditor process is not obliged to act with respect to the process.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a receiving bank has received more than 1 payment order of the sender or 1 or more payment orders and other items that are payable from the sender's account, the bank may charge the sender's account with respect to the various orders and items in any sequence.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4A506.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If, under this article, a receiving bank is obliged to pay interest with respect to a payment order issued to the bank, the amount payable may be determined (i) by agreement of the sender and receiving bank, or (ii) by a funds-transfer system rule if the payment order is transmitted through a funds-transfer system.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the amount of interest is not determined by an agreement or rule as stated in subsection (1), the amount is calculated by multiplying the applicable federal funds rate by the amount on which interest is payable, and then multiplying the product by the number of days for which interest is payable. The applicable federal funds rate is the average of the federal funds rates published by the federal reserve bank of New York for each of the days for which interest is payable divided by 360. The federal funds rate for any day on which a published rate is not available is the same as the published rate for the next preceding day for which there is a published rate. If a receiving bank that accepted a payment order is required to refund payment to the sender of the order because the funds transfer was not completed, but the failure to complete was not due to any fault by the bank, the interest payable is reduced by a percentage equal to the reserve requirement on deposits of the receiving bank.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The following rules apply unless the affected parties otherwise agree or subsection (3) applies:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The rights and obligations between the sender of a payment order and the receiving bank are governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the receiving bank is located.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The rights and obligations between the beneficiary's bank and the beneficiary are governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the beneficiary's bank is located.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The issue of when payment is made pursuant to a funds transfer by the originator to the beneficiary is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the beneficiary's bank is located.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the parties described in each subdivision of subsection (1) have made an agreement selecting the law of a particular jurisdiction to govern rights and obligations between each other, the law of that jurisdiction governs those rights and obligations, whether or not the payment order or the funds transfer bears a reasonable relation to that jurisdiction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A funds-transfer system rule may select the law of a particular jurisdiction to govern (i) rights and obligations between participating banks with respect to payment orders transmitted or processed through the system, or (ii) the rights and obligations of some or all parties to a funds transfer any part of which is carried out by means of the system. A choice of law made pursuant to clause (i) is binding on participating banks. A choice of law made pursuant to clause (ii) is binding on the originator, other sender, or a receiving bank having notice that the funds-transfer system might be used in the funds transfer and of the choice of law by the system when the originator, other sender, or receiving bank issued or accepted a payment order. The beneficiary of a funds transfer is bound by the choice of law if, when the funds transfer is initiated, the beneficiary has notice that the funds-transfer system might be used in the funds transfer and of the choice of law by the system. The law of a jurisdiction selected pursuant to this subsection may govern, whether or not that law bears a reasonable relation to the matter in issue.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In the event of inconsistency between an agreement under subsection (2) and a choice-of-law rule under subsection (3), the agreement under subsection (2) prevails.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A nominated person who is not a confirmer is not obligated to honor or otherwise give value for a presentation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A person requested to advise may decline to act as an adviser. An adviser that is not a confirmer is not obligated to honor or give value for a presentation. An adviser undertakes to the issuer and to the beneficiary accurately to advise the terms of the letter of credit, confirmation, amendment, or advice received by that person and undertakes to the beneficiary to check the apparent authenticity of the request to advise. Even if the advice is inaccurate, the letter of credit, confirmation, or amendment is enforceable as issued.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A person who notifies a transferee beneficiary of the terms of a letter of credit, confirmation, amendment, or advice has the rights and obligations of an adviser under subsection (3).

Except as otherwise provided in section 5113 and unless otherwise agreed with the applicant, an issuer shall dishonor a presentation that does not appear to comply.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   To give notice to the presenter of discrepancies in the presentation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4), an issuer is precluded from asserting as a basis for dishonor any discrepancy if timely notice is not given, or any discrepancy not stated in the notice if timely notice is given.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Failure to give the notice specified in subsection (2) or to mention fraud, forgery, or expiration in the notice does not preclude the issuer from asserting as a basis for dishonor fraud or forgery as described in section 5109(1) or expiration of the letter of credit before presentation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   An issuer shall observe standard practice of financial institutions that regularly issue letters of credit. Determination of the issuer's observance of the standard practice is a matter of interpretation for the court. The court shall offer the parties a reasonable opportunity to present evidence of the standard practice.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   An issuer is not responsible for:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   An issuer that has honored a presentation as permitted or required by this article:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Is entitled to be reimbursed by the applicant in immediately available funds not later than the date of its payment of funds.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The issuer shall honor the presentation, if honor is demanded by 1 or more of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   A nominated person who has given value in good faith and without notice of forgery or material fraud.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   A confirmer who has honored its confirmation in good faith.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   A holder in due course of a draft drawn under the letter of credit which was taken after acceptance by the issuer or nominated person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)   An assignee of the issuer's or nominated person's deferred obligation that was taken for value and without notice of forgery or material fraud after the obligation was incurred by the issuer or nominated person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The issuer, acting in good faith, may honor or dishonor the presentation in any other cause.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If an applicant claims that a required document is forged or materially fraudulent or that honor of the presentation would facilitate a material fraud by the beneficiary on the issuer or applicant, a court of competent jurisdiction may temporarily or permanently enjoin the issuer from honoring a presentation or grant similar relief against the issuer or other persons only if the court finds all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The relief is not prohibited under the law applicable to an accepted draft or deferred obligation incurred by the issuer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A beneficiary, issuer, or nominated person who may be adversely affected is adequately protected against loss that it may suffer because the relief is granted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   All of the conditions to entitle a person to the relief under the law of this state have been met.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   On the basis of the information submitted to the court, the applicant is more likely than not to succeed under its claim of forgery or material fraud and the person demanding honor does not qualify for protection under subsection (1)(a).</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 5111.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If an issuer wrongfully dishonors or repudiates its obligation to pay money under a letter of credit before presentation, the beneficiary, successor, or nominated person presenting on its own behalf may recover from the issuer the amount that is the subject of the dishonor or repudiation. If the issuer's obligation under the letter of credit is not for the payment of money, the claimant may obtain specific performance or, at the claimant's election, recover an amount equal to the value of performance from the issuer. In either case, the claimant may also recover incidental but not consequential damages. The claimant is not obligated to take action to avoid damages that might be due from the issuer under this subsection. If, although not obligated to do so, the claimant avoids damages, the claimant's recovery from the issuer must be reduced by the amount of damages avoided. The issuer has the burden of proving the amount of damages avoided. In the case of repudiation the claimant need not present any document.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If an issuer wrongfully dishonors a draft or demand presented under a letter of credit or honors a draft or demand in breach of its obligation to the applicant, the applicant may recover damages resulting from the breach, including incidental but not consequential damages, less any amount saved as a result of the breach.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If an adviser or nominated person other than a confirmer breaches an obligation under this article or an issuer breaches an obligation not covered in subsection (1) or (2), a person to whom the obligation is owed may recover damages resulting from the breach, including incidental but not consequential damages, less any amount saved as a result of the breach. To the extent of the confirmation, a confirmer has the liability of an issuer specified in this subsection and subsections (1) and (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   An issuer, nominated person, or adviser who is found liable under subsection (1), (2), or (3) shall pay interest on the amount owed from the date of wrongful dishonor or other appropriate date.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses of litigation shall be awarded to the prevailing party in an action in which a remedy is sought under this article.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Damages that would otherwise be payable by a party for breach of an obligation under this article may be liquidated by agreement or undertaking, but only in an amount or by a formula that is reasonable in light of the harm anticipated.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided in section 5113, unless a letter of credit provides that it is transferable, the right of a beneficiary to draw or otherwise demand performance under a letter of credit may not be transferred.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Even if a letter of credit provides that it is transferable, the issuer may refuse to recognize or carry out a transfer if either of the following applies:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The transfer would violate applicable law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The transferor or transferee has failed to comply with any requirement stated in the letter of credit or any other requirement relating to transfer imposed by the issuer which is within the standard practice referred to in section 5108(5) or is otherwise reasonable under the circumstances.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 5113.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A successor of a beneficiary may consent to amendments, sign and present documents, and receive payment or other items of value in the name of the beneficiary without disclosing its status as a successor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A successor of a beneficiary may consent to amendments, sign and present documents, and receive payment or other items of value in its own name as the disclosed successor of the beneficiary. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5), an issuer shall recognize a disclosed successor of a beneficiary as beneficiary in full substitution for its predecessor upon compliance with the requirements for recognition by the issuer of a transfer of drawing rights by operation of law under the standard practice referred to in section 5108(5) or, in the absence of such a practice, compliance with other reasonable procedures sufficient to protect the issuer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   An issuer is not obliged to determine whether a purported successor is a successor of a beneficiary or whether the signature of a purported successor is genuine or authorized.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Honor of a purported successor's apparently complying presentation under subsection (1) or (2) has the consequences specified in section 5108(9) even if the purported successor is not the successor of a beneficiary. Documents signed in the name of the beneficiary or of a disclosed successor by a person who is neither the beneficiary nor the successor of the beneficiary are forged documents for the purposes of section 5109.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   An issuer whose rights of reimbursement are not covered by subsection (4) or substantially similar law and any confirmer or nominated person may decline to recognize a presentation under subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A beneficiary whose name is changed after the issuance of a letter of credit has the same rights and obligations as a successor of a beneficiary under this section.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 5114.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In this section, "proceeds of a letter of credit" means the cash, check, accepted draft, or other item of value paid or delivered upon honor or giving of value by the issuer or any nominated person under the letter of credit. The term does not include a beneficiary's drawing rights or documents presented by the beneficiary.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A beneficiary may assign its right to part or all of the proceeds of a letter of credit. The beneficiary may do so before presentation as a present assignment of its right to receive proceeds contingent upon its compliance with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   An issuer or nominated person need not recognize an assignment of proceeds of a letter of credit until it consents to the assignment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   An issuer or nominated person has no obligation to give or withhold its consent to an assignment of proceeds of a letter of credit, but consent may not be unreasonably withheld if the assignee possesses and exhibits the letter of credit and presentation of the letter of credit is a condition to honor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Rights of a transferee beneficiary or nominated person are independent of the beneficiary's assignment of the proceeds of a letter of credit and are superior to the assignee's right to the proceeds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The rights recognized by this section between an assignee and an issuer, transferee beneficiary, or nominated person or the issuer's or nominated person's payment of proceeds to an assignee or a third person do not affect the rights between the assignee and any person other than the issuer, transferee beneficiary, or nominated person. The mode of creating and perfecting a security interest in or granting an assignment of a beneficiary's rights to proceeds is governed by article 9 or other law. Against persons other than the issuer, transferee beneficiary, or nominated person, the rights and obligations arising upon the creation of a security interest or other assignment of a beneficiary's right to proceeds and its perfection are governed by article 9 or other law.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 5116.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser for action or omission is governed by the law of the jurisdiction chosen by an agreement in the form of a record signed or otherwise authenticated by the affected parties in the manner provided in section 5104 or by a provision in the person's letter of credit, confirmation, or other undertaking. The jurisdiction whose law is chosen need not bear any relation to the transaction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Unless subsection (1) applies, the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser for action or omission is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the person is located. The person is considered to be located at the address indicated in the person's undertaking. If more than 1 address is indicated, the person is considered to be located at the address from which the person's undertaking was issued. For the purpose of jurisdiction, choice of law, and recognition of interbranch letters of credit, but not enforcement of a judgment, all branches of a bank are considered separate juridical entities and a bank is considered to be located at the place where its relevant branch is considered to be located under this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser is governed by any rules of custom or practice, such as the uniform customs and practice for documentary credits, to which the letter of credit, confirmation, or other undertaking is expressly made subject. If this article would govern the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser under subsection (1) or (2), or the relevant undertaking incorporates rules of custom or practice, or there is conflict between this article and those rules as applied to that undertaking, those rules govern except to the extent of any conflict with the nonvariable provisions specified in section 5103(3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If there is conflict between this article and article 3, 4, 4a, or 9, this article governs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The forum for settling disputes arising out of an undertaking within this article may be chosen in the manner and with the binding effect that governing law may be chosen in accordance with subsection (1).</DIV>

<P>Sec. 5117.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An issuer that honors a beneficiary's presentation is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary to the same extent as if the issuer were a secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the beneficiary and of the applicant to the same extent as if the issuer were the secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the applicant.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An applicant that reimburses an issuer is subrogated to the rights of the issuer against any beneficiary, presenter, or nominated person to the same extent as if the applicant were the secondary obligor of the obligations owed to the issuer and has the rights of subrogation of the issuer to the rights of the beneficiary stated in subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A nominated person who pays or gives value against a draft or demand presented under a letter of credit is subrogated to the rights of all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The issuer against the applicant to the same extent as if the nominated person were a secondary obligor of the obligation owed to the issuer by the applicant.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The beneficiary to the same extent as if the nominated person were a secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the beneficiary.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The applicant to the same extent as if the nominated person were a secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the applicant.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Notwithstanding any agreement or term to the contrary, the rights of subrogation stated in subsections (1) and (2) do not arise until the issuer honors the letter of credit or otherwise pays and the rights in subsection (3) do not arise until the nominated person pays or otherwise gives value. Until then, the issuer, nominated person, and the applicant do not derive under this section present or prospective rights forming the basis of a claim, defense, or excuse.</DIV>

On request of the bailor in a record at the time of signing the storage agreement or within a reasonable time after receipt of the warehouse receipt, the warehouse's liability may be increased on part or all of the goods covered by the storage agreement or the warehouse receipt.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A warehouse has a lien against the bailor on the goods covered by a warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds of those goods in its possession for charges for storage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, insurance, labor, or other charges, present or future, in relation to the goods, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law. If the person on whose account the goods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in relation to other goods whenever deposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that a lien is claimed for charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouse also has a lien against the goods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds of those goods in its possession for those charges and expenses, whether or not the other goods have been delivered by the warehouse. However, as against a person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt is duly negotiated, a warehouse's lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified in the warehouse receipt or, if no charges are so specified, to a reasonable charge for storage of the specific goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A warehouse may also reserve a security interest against the bailor for the maximum amount specified on the receipt for charges other than those specified in subsection (1), such as for money advanced and interest. The security interest is governed by article 9. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A warehouse's lien for charges and expenses under subsection (1) or a security interest under subsection (2) is also effective against any person that so entrusted the bailor with possession of the goods that a pledge of them by the bailor to a good faith purchaser for value would have been valid. However, the lien or security interest is not effective against a person that before issuance of a document of title had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in the goods and that did not do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to the bailor or the bailor's nominee with any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Actual or apparent authority to ship, store, or sell. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Power to obtain delivery under section 7403.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Power of disposition under section 2403, 2A304(2), 2A305(2), 9320, or 9321 or other statute or rule of law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A warehouse's lien on household goods for charges and expenses in relation to the goods under subsection (1) is also effective against all persons if the depositor was the legal possessor of the goods at the time of deposit. As used in this subsection, "household goods" means furniture, furnishings, or personal effects used by the depositor in a dwelling.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A warehouse loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably refuses to deliver.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2), a warehouse's lien may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. The notification must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by the warehouse is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. A warehouse sells in a commercially reasonable manner if the warehouse sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market for the goods, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the preceding sentence. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A warehouse may enforce its lien on goods, other than goods stored by a merchant in the course of its business, only if the following requirements are satisfied: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) All persons known to claim an interest in the goods must be notified.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The notification must include an itemized statement of the claim, a description of the goods subject to the lien, a demand for payment within a specified time not less than 10 days after receipt of the notification, and a conspicuous statement that unless the claim is paid within that time the goods will be advertised for sale and sold by auction at a specified time and place.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The sale must conform to the terms of the notification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The sale must be held at the nearest suitable place to where the goods are held or stored.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) After the expiration of the time given in the notification, an advertisement of the sale must be published once a week for 2 weeks consecutively in a newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held. The advertisement must include a description of the goods, the name of the person on whose account the goods are being held, and the time and place of the sale. The sale must take place at least 15 days after the first publication. If there is no newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held, the advertisement must be posted at least 10 days before the sale in not fewer than 6 conspicuous places in the neighborhood of the proposed sale.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in complying with this section. In that event, the goods may not be sold but must be retained by the warehouse subject to the terms of the receipt and this article.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A warehouse may buy at any public sale held pursuant to this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a warehouse's lien takes the goods free of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the warehouse's noncompliance with this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the warehouse would have been bound to deliver the goods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against a debtor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a lien is on goods stored by a merchant in the course of its business, the lien may be enforced in accordance with subsection (1) or (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A warehouse is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirements for sale under this section and, in case of willful violation, is liable for conversion.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A consignee of a nonnegotiable bill of lading which has given value in good faith, or a holder to which a negotiable bill has been duly negotiated, relying upon the description of the goods in the bill or upon the date shown in the bill, may recover from the issuer damages caused by the misdating of the bill or the nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods, except to the extent that the bill indicates that the issuer does not know whether any part or all of the goods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as in a case in which the description is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity, or condition or the receipt or description is qualified by "contents or condition of contents of packages unknown", "said to contain", "shipper's weight, load, and count", or words of similar import, if that indication is true.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) All of the following apply if goods are loaded by the issuer of a bill of lading:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The issuer shall count the packages of goods if shipped in packages and ascertain the kind and quantity if shipped in bulk. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Words such as "shipper's weight, load, and count", or words of similar import indicating that the description was made by the shipper are ineffective except as to goods concealed in packages. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If bulk goods are loaded by a shipper that makes available to the issuer of a bill of lading adequate facilities for weighing those goods, the issuer shall ascertain the kind and quantity within a reasonable time after receiving the shipper's request in a record to do so. In that case, "shipper's weight" or words of similar import are ineffective. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The issuer of a bill of lading, by including in the bill the words "shipper's weight, load, and count", or words of similar import, may indicate that the goods were loaded by the shipper, and, if that statement is true, the issuer is not liable for damages caused by the improper loading. However, omission of those words does not imply liability for damages caused by improper loading.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A shipper guarantees to an issuer the accuracy at the time of shipment of the description, marks, labels, number, kind, quantity, condition, and weight, as furnished by the shipper, and the shipper shall indemnify the issuer against damage caused by inaccuracies in those particulars. This right of indemnity does not limit the issuer's responsibility or liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A carrier has a lien on the goods covered by a bill of lading or on the proceeds of those goods in its possession for charges after the date of the carrier's receipt of the goods for storage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods incident to their transportation or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law. However, against a purchaser for value of a negotiable bill of lading, a carrier's lien is limited to charges stated in the bill or the applicable tariffs or, if no charges are stated, a reasonable charge.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A lien for charges and expenses under subsection (1) on goods that the carrier was required by law to receive for transportation is effective against the consignor or any person entitled to the goods unless the carrier had notice that the consignor lacked authority to subject the goods to those charges and expenses. Any other lien under subsection (1) is effective against the consignor and any person that permitted the bailor to have control or possession of the goods unless the carrier had notice that the bailor lacked authority.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A carrier's lien on goods may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. The notification must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by the carrier is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. The carrier sells goods in a commercially reasonable manner if the carrier sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market for that type of goods, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in complying with this section. In that event, the goods may not be sold but must be retained by the carrier subject to the terms of the bill of lading and this article.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A carrier may buy at any public sale pursuant to this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a carrier's lien takes the goods free of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the carrier's noncompliance with this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A carrier may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the carrier would have been bound to deliver the goods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against a debtor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A carrier's lien may be enforced pursuant to either subsection (1) or the procedure set forth in section 7210(2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A carrier is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirements for sale under this section and, in case of willful violation, is liable for conversion.</div>

However, such a limitation is not effective with respect to the carrier's liability for conversion to its own use.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) All of the following rules apply to a negotiable tangible document of title: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person, the document is negotiated by the named person's indorsement and delivery. After the named person's indorsement in blank or to bearer, any person may negotiate the document by delivery alone.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the document's original terms run to bearer, it is negotiated by delivery alone.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person and it is delivered to the named person, the effect is the same as if the document had been negotiated. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Negotiation of the document after it has been indorsed to a named person requires indorsement by the named person and delivery.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A document is duly negotiated if it is negotiated in the manner stated in this subsection to a holder that purchases it in good faith, without notice of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person, and for value, unless it is established that the negotiation is not in the regular course of business or financing or involves receiving the document in settlement or payment of a monetary obligation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) All of the following rules apply to a negotiable electronic document of title:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person or to bearer, the document is negotiated by delivery of the document to another person. Indorsement by the named person is not required to negotiate the document.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person and the named person has control of the document, the effect is the same as if the document had been negotiated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A document is duly negotiated if it is negotiated in the manner stated in this subsection to a holder that purchases it in good faith, without notice of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person, and for value, unless it is established that the negotiation is not in the regular course of business or financing or involves taking delivery of the document in settlement or payment of a monetary obligation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Indorsement of a nonnegotiable document neither makes it negotiable nor adds to the transferee's rights.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The naming in a negotiable bill of a person to be notified of the arrival of the goods does not limit the negotiability of the bill or constitute notice to a purchaser of the bill of any interest of that person in the goods.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Title to the goods. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) All rights accruing under the law of agency or estoppel, including rights to goods delivered to the bailee after the document was issued. </div>

However, in the case of a delivery order, the bailee's obligation accrues only upon the bailee's acceptance of the delivery order and the obligation acquired by the holder is that the issuer and any indorser will procure the acceptance of the bailee.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The due negotiation or any prior due negotiation constituted a breach of duty. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Any person has been deprived of possession of a negotiable tangible document or control of a negotiable electronic document by misrepresentation, fraud, accident, mistake, duress, loss, theft, or conversion. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to the bailor or his or her nominee with any of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In the case of a transfer of a nonnegotiable document of title, until but not after the bailee receives notice of the transfer, the rights of the transferee may be defeated by any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) By those creditors of the transferor which could treat the transfer as void under section 2402 or 2A308.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a document of title is lost, stolen, or destroyed, a court may order delivery of the goods or issuance of a substitute document and the bailee may without liability to any person comply with the order. If the document was negotiable, a court may not order delivery of the goods or issuance of a substitute document without the claimant's posting security unless it finds that any person that may suffer loss as a result of nonsurrender of possession or control of the document is adequately protected against the loss. If the document was nonnegotiable, the court may require security. The court may also order payment of the bailee's reasonable costs and attorney fees in any action under this subsection.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The person is a purchaser to whom a security is delivered pursuant to section 8301.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The person acquires a security entitlement to the security pursuant to section 8501. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A person who acquires a security entitlement to a security or other financial asset has the rights specified in part 5, but is a purchaser of any security, security entitlement, or other financial asset held by the securities intermediary only to the extent provided in section 8503.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 8105.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    A person has notice of an adverse claim if 1 or more of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The person knows of the adverse claim.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The person is aware of facts sufficient to indicate that there is a significant probability that the adverse claim exists and deliberately avoids information that would establish the existence of the adverse claim.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The person has a duty, imposed by statute or regulation, to investigate whether an adverse claim exists, and the investigation so required would establish the existence of the adverse claim.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Having knowledge that a financial asset or interest in a financial asset is or has been transferred by a representative imposes no duty of inquiry into the rightfulness of a transaction and is not notice of an adverse claim. However, a person who knows that a representative has transferred a financial asset or interest in a financial asset in a transaction that is, or whose proceeds are being used, for the individual benefit of the representative or otherwise in breach of duty has notice of an adverse claim.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   An act or event that creates a right to immediate performance of the principal obligation represented by a security certificate or sets a date on or after which the certificate is to be presented or surrendered for redemption or exchange does not itself constitute notice of an adverse claim except in the case of a transfer that meets either of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Is more than 1 year after a date set for presentment or surrender for redemption or exchange. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Is more than 6 months after a date set for payment of money against presentation or surrender of the certificate, if money was available for payment on that date. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A purchaser of a certificated security has notice of an adverse claim if the security certificate applies to 1 of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Whether in bearer or registered form, has been indorsed "for collection" or "for surrender" or for some other purpose not involving transfer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Is in bearer form and has on it an unambiguous statement that it is the property of a person other than the transferor, but the mere writing of a name on the certificate is not such a statement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Filing of a financing statement under article 9 is not notice of an adverse claim to a financial asset.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The securities intermediary has agreed that it will comply with entitlement orders originated by the purchaser without further consent by the entitlement holder.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If an interest in a security entitlement is granted by the entitlement holder to the entitlement holder's own securities intermediary, the securities intermediary has control.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A purchaser who has satisfied the requirements of subsection (3)(b) or (4)(b) has control even if the registered owner in the case of subsection (3)(b) or the entitlement holder in the case of subsection (4)(b) retains the right to make substitutions for the uncertificated security or security entitlement, to originate instructions or entitlement orders to the issuer or securities intermediary, or otherwise to deal with the uncertificated security or security entitlement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   An issuer or a securities intermediary may not enter into an agreement of the kind described in subsection (3)(b) or (4)(b) without the consent of the registered owner or entitlement holder, but an issuer or a securities intermediary is not required to enter into such an agreement even though the registered owner or entitlement holder so directs. An issuer or securities intermediary that has entered into such an agreement is not required to confirm the existence of the agreement to another party unless requested to do so by the registered owner or entitlement holder.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The indorsement is effective.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A person who originates an instruction for registration of transfer of an uncertificated security warrants to the issuer both of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The instruction is effective. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   At the time the instruction is presented to the issuer, the purchaser will be entitled to the registration of transfer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A person who presents a certificated security for registration of transfer or for payment or exchange warrants to the issuer that the person is entitled to the registration, payment, or exchange, but a purchaser for value and without notice of adverse claims to whom transfer is registered warrants only that the person has no knowledge of any unauthorized signature in a necessary indorsement. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   "Issuer's jurisdiction" means the jurisdiction under which the issuer of the security is organized or, if permitted by the law of that jurisdiction, the law of another jurisdiction specified by the issuer. An issuer organized under the law of this state may specify the law of another jurisdiction as the law governing the matters specified in subsection (1)(b) through (e).</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 8202.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Even against a purchaser for value and without notice, the terms of a certified security include terms stated on the certificate and terms made part of the security by reference on the certificate to another instrument, indenture, or document or to a constitution, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or order, to the extent the terms referred to do not conflict with terms stated on the certificate. A reference under this subsection does not of itself charge a purchaser for value with notice of a defect going to the validity of the security, even if the certificate expressly states that a person accepting it admits notice. The terms of an uncertificated security include those stated in any instrument, indenture, or document or in a constitution, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, or the like, pursuant to which the security is issued.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The following rules apply if an issuer asserts that a security is not valid:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A security other than one issued by a government or governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality, even though issued with a defect going to its validity, is valid in the hands of a purchaser for value and without notice of the particular defect unless the defect involves a violation of a constitutional provision. In that case, the security is valid in the hands of a purchaser for value and without notice of the defect, other than one who takes by original issue.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Subdivision (a) applies to an issuer that is a government or governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality only if there has been substantial compliance with the legal requirements governing the issuer or the issuer has received a substantial consideration for the issue as a whole or for the particular security and a stated purpose of the issue is one for which the issuer has power to borrow money or issue the security.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as otherwise provided in section 8205, lack of genuineness of a certificated security is a complete defense, even against a purchaser for value and without notice.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   All other defenses of the issuer of a security, including nondelivery and conditional delivery of a certificated security, are ineffective against a purchaser for value who has taken the certificated security without notice of the particular defense.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   This section does not affect the right of a party to cancel a contract for a security "when, as and if issued" or "when distributed" in the event of a material change in the character of the security that is the subject to the contract or in the plan or arrangement pursuant to which the security is to be issued or distributed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If a security is held by a securities intermediary against whom an entitlement holder has a security entitlement with respect to the security, the issuer may not assert any defense that the issuer could not assert if the entitlement holder held the security directly.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Requires the payment of money, the delivery of a certificated security, the registration of transfer of an uncertificated security, or any of them on presentation or surrender of the security certificate, the money or security is available on the date set for payment or exchange, and the purchaser takes the security more than 1 year after that date.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 8304.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    An indorsement may be in blank or special. An indorsement in blank includes an indorsement to bearer. A special indorsement specifies to whom a security is to be transferred or who has power to transfer it. A holder may convert a blank indorsement to a special indorsement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An indorsement purporting to be only of part of a security certificate representing units intended by the issuer to be separately transferable is effective to the extent of the indorsement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   An indorsement, whether special or in blank, does not constitute a transfer until delivery of the certificate on which it appears or, if the indorsement is on a separate document, until delivery of both the document and the certificate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a security certificate in registered form has been delivered to a purchaser without a necessary indorsement, the purchaser may become a protected purchaser only when the indorsement is supplied. However, against a transferor, a transfer is complete upon delivery and the purchaser has a specifically enforceable right to have any necessary indorsement supplied.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   An indorsement of a security certificate in bearer form may give notice of an adverse claim to the certificate, but it does not otherwise affect a right to registration that the holder possesses.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Unless otherwise agreed, a person making an indorsement assumes only the obligations provided in Section 8108 and not an obligation that the security will be honored by the issuer.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The signature was genuine. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The signer was an appropriate person to indorse, or if the signature is by an agent, the agent had actual authority to act on behalf of the appropriate person. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The signer had legal capacity to sign.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A person who specially guarantees the signature of an originator of an instruction makes the warranties of a signature guarantor under subsection (2) and also warrants that at the time the instruction is presented to the issuer:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The person specified in the instruction as the registered owner of the uncertificated security will be the registered owner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The transfer of the uncertificated security requested in the instruction will be registered by the issuer free from all liens, security interests, restrictions, and claims other than those specified in the instruction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A guarantor under subsections (1) and (2) or a special guarantor under subsection (3) does not otherwise warrant the rightfulness of the transfer. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A person who guarantees an indorsement of a security certificate makes the warranties of a signature guarantor under subsection (1) and also warrants the rightfulness of the transfer in all respects.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A person who guarantees an instruction requesting the transfer of an uncertificated security makes the warranties of a special signature guarantor under subsection (3) and also warrants the rightfulness of the transfer in all respects.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   An issuer may not require a special guaranty of signature, a guaranty of indorsement, or a guaranty of instruction as a condition to registration of transfer. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The warranties under this section are made to a person taking or dealing with the security in reliance on the guaranty, and the guarantor is liable to the person for loss resulting from their breach. An indorser or originator of an instruction whose signature, indorsement, or instruction has been guaranteed is liable to a guarantor for any loss suffered by the guarantor as a result of breach of the warranties of the guarantor.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 8402.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The issuer may require the following assurance that each necessary indorsement or each instruction is genuine and authorized: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   In all cases, a guarantee of the signature of the person making an indorsement or originating an instruction including, in the case of an instruction, reasonable assurance of identity. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the indorsement is made or the instruction is originated by an agent, appropriate assurance of actual authority to sign.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If the indorsement is made or the instruction is originated by a fiduciary pursuant to section 8107(1)(d) or (e), appropriate evidence of appointment or incumbency.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   In the case of a fiduciary appointed or qualified by a court, a certificate issued by or under the direction or supervision of that court or an officer of that court and dated within 60 days before the date of presentation for transfer. </DIV>

The demand is effective only if it is received by the issuer at a time and in a manner affording the issuer reasonable opportunity to act on it.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The certificated security has been presented for registration of transfer or instruction for registration of transfer of uncertificated security has been received.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A demand that the issuer not register transfer had previously been received.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The issuer will withhold registration of transfer for a period of time stated in the notification in order to provide the person who initiated the demand an opportunity to obtain legal process or an indemnity bond.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The period described in subsection (2)(c) may not exceed 30 days after the date of communication of the notification. A shorter period may be specified by the issuer if it is not manifestly unreasonable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   An issuer is not liable to a person who initiated a demand that the issuer not register transfer for any loss the person suffers as a result of registration of a transfer pursuant to an effective indorsement or instruction if the person who initiated the demand does not, within the time stated in the issuer's communication, do either of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Obtain an appropriate restraining order, injunction, or other process from a court of competent jurisdiction enjoining the issuer from registering the transfer. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   File with the issuer an indemnity bond, sufficient in the issuer's judgment to protect the issuer and any transfer agent, registrar, or other agent of the issuer involved from any loss it or they may suffer by refusing to register the transfer. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Pursuant to an ineffective indorsement or instruction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   After a demand that the issuer not register transfer became effective under section 8403(1) and the issuer did not comply with section 8403(2). </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    To the extent necessary for a securities intermediary to satisfy all security entitlements with respect to a particular financial asset, all interests in that financial asset held by the securities intermediary are held by the securities intermediary for the entitlement holders, are not property of the securities intermediary, and are not subject to claims of creditors of the securities intermediary, except as otherwise provided in section 8511.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An entitlement holder's property interest with respect to a particular financial asset under subsection (1) is a pro rata property interest in all interests in that financial asset held by the securities intermediary, without regard to the time the entitlement holder acquired the security entitlement or the time the securities intermediary acquired the interest in that financial asset.</DIV>

If the trustee or other liquidator elects not to pursue that right, an entitlement holder whose security entitlement remains unsatisfied has the right to recover its interest in the financial asset from the purchaser.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   An action based on the entitlement holder's property interest with respect to a particular financial asset under subsection (1), whether framed in conversion, replevin, constructive trust, equitable lien, or other theory, may not be asserted against any purchaser of a financial asset or interest therein who gives value, obtains control, and does not act in collusion with the securities intermediary in violating the securities intermediary's obligations under section 8504.</DIV>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>440.9103 Purchase-money security interest; application of payments; burden of establishing.</B><P>
</P>
<P>Sec. 9103.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   As used in this section:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Purchase-money collateral" means goods or software that secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to that collateral.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Purchase-money obligation" means an obligation of an obligor incurred as all or part of the price of the collateral or for value given to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or the use of the collateral if the value is in fact so used.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A security interest in goods is a purchase-money security interest to the following extent, as applicable:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   To the extent that the goods are purchase-money collateral with respect to that security interest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the security interest is in inventory that is or was purchase-money collateral, also to the extent that the security interest secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to other inventory in which the secured party holds or held a purchase-money security interest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Also to the extent that the security interest secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to software in which the secured party holds or held a purchase-money security interest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A security interest in software is a purchase-money security interest to the extent that the security interest also secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to goods in which the secured party holds or held a purchase-money security interest if the debtor acquired its interest in the software in an integrated transaction in which it acquired an interest in the goods, and the debtor acquired its interest in the software for the principal purpose of using the software in the goods.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The security interest of a consignor in goods that are the subject of a consignment is a purchase-money security interest in inventory.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   In a transaction other than a consumer-goods transaction, if the extent to which a security interest is a purchase-money security interest depends on the application of a payment to a particular obligation, the payment must be applied in 1 of the following, as applicable:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   In accordance with any reasonable method of application to which the parties agree.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   In the absence of the parties' agreement to a reasonable method, in accordance with any intention of the obligor manifested at or before the time of payment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   In the absence of an agreement to a reasonable method and a timely manifestation of the obligor's intention, in the following order:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   To obligations that are not secured.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   If more than 1 obligation is secured, to obligations secured by purchase-money security interests in the order in which those obligations were incurred.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   In a transaction other than a consumer-goods transaction, a purchase-money security interest does not lose its status as such, even if the purchase-money collateral also secures an obligation that is not a purchase-money obligation, collateral that is not purchase-money collateral also secures the purchase-money obligation, or the purchase-money obligation has been renewed, refinanced, consolidated, or restructured.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   In a transaction other than a consumer-goods transaction, a secured party claiming a purchase-money security interest has the burden of establishing the extent to which the security interest is a purchase-money security interest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The limitation of the rules in subsections (5), (6), and (7) to transactions other than consumer-goods transactions is intended to leave to the court the determination of the proper rules in consumer-goods transactions. The court may not infer from that limitation the nature of the proper rule in consumer-goods transactions and may continue to apply established approaches.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A security interest attaches to collateral when it becomes enforceable against the debtor with respect to the collateral, unless an agreement expressly postpones the time of attachment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (3) through (9), a security interest is enforceable against the debtor and third parties with respect to the collateral only if all of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Value has been given.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The debtor has rights in the collateral or the power to transfer rights in the collateral to a secured party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) One or more of the following conditions are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The debtor has authenticated a security agreement that provides a description of the collateral and, if the security interest covers timber to be cut, a description of the land concerned.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The collateral is not a certificated security and is in the possession of the secured party under section 9313 pursuant to the debtor's security agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The collateral is a certificated security in registered form and the security certificate has been delivered to the secured party under section 8301 pursuant to the debtor's security agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The collateral is deposit accounts, electronic chattel paper, investment property, letter-of-credit rights, or electronic documents, and the secured party has control under section 7106, 9104, 9105, 9106, or 9107 pursuant to the debtor's security agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Subsection (2) is subject to section 4210 on the security interest of a collecting bank, section 5118 on the security interest of a letter-of-credit issuer or nominated person, section 9110 on a security interest arising under article 2 or 2A, and section 9206 on security interests in investment property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A person becomes bound as debtor by a security agreement entered into by another person if, by operation of law other than this article or by contract, either of the following occurs:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The person becomes generally obligated for the obligations of the other person, including the obligation secured under the security agreement, and acquires or succeeds to all or substantially all of the assets of the other person.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a new debtor becomes bound as debtor by a security agreement entered into by another person, the agreement satisfies subsection (2)(c) with respect to existing or after-acquired property of the new debtor to the extent the property is described in the agreement, and another agreement is not necessary to make a security interest in the property enforceable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The attachment of a security interest in collateral gives the secured party the rights to proceeds provided by section 9315 and is also attachment of a security interest in a supporting obligation for the collateral.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The attachment of a security interest in a right to payment or performance secured by a security interest or other lien on personal or real property is also attachment of a security interest in the security interest, mortgage, or other lien.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The attachment of a security interest in a securities account is also attachment of a security interest in the security entitlements carried in the securities account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The attachment of a security interest in a commodity account is also attachment of a security interest in the commodity contracts carried in the commodity account.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A statute, regulation, or treaty of the United States whose requirements for a security interest's obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to the property preempt section 9310(1).</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5), a buyer of goods from a person who used or bought the goods for use primarily for personal, family, or household purposes takes free of a security interest, even if perfected, if the buyer buys without knowledge of the security interest, for value, primarily for the buyer's personal, family, or household purposes, and before the filing of a financing statement covering the goods.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   To the extent that it affects the priority of a security interest over a buyer of goods under subsection (2), the period of effectiveness of a filing made in the jurisdiction in which the seller is located is governed by section 9316(1) and (2).</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   A debtor engaged in farming operations who provides a written list of potential buyers to a secured party pursuant to subsection (7) shall not sell farm products that secure the debt to a buyer who is not identified on the list without the prior written consent of the secured party. A person who knowingly or intentionally violates this subsection is guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 3 years or a fine of not more than $10,000.00, or both. If appropriate given the facts and circumstances of the case, the court shall place the person on probation upon the condition that restitution be made to the secured party.

This subsection does not apply to any payment or partial payment made before notice under subsection (9) has been received by the buyer. A buyer of farm products who violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 90 days or a fine of not more than $1,000.00, or both. Payment of the debt upon which the security interest is based is an absolute defense to a prosecution under this subsection if payment is made prior to commencement of prosecution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   As used in subsections (6) to (12), "person buying farm products" or "buyer" includes a commission merchant or selling agent who sells farm products in the ordinary course of business for a person engaged in farming operations.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(14)   A buyer in ordinary course of business who receives notice pursuant to subsection (9), who buys farm products from a person engaged in farming operations, and who withholds all or part of the proceeds of the sale from the seller in order to satisfy a debt owed by the seller to the buyer, takes subject to a security interest in those farm products created by the seller, unless the debt owed by the seller to the buyer was secured by a prior perfected security interest. For purposes of this subsection, "debt" does not include the cost of harvesting; processing, including packaging, freezing, canning, and drying; storing; marketing; or transporting farm products to market.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(15)   Except as otherwise provided by subsection (16), a commission merchant or selling agent who sells farm products, in the ordinary course of business, for a person engaged in farming operations is not liable to the holder of a security interest in those farm products even though the security interest is perfected and even though the commission merchant or selling agent knows of its existence.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(16)   A commission merchant or selling agent who sells farm products, in the ordinary course of business, for a person engaged in farming operations, and who receives notice pursuant to subsection (9), shall not be protected from liability under subsection (15) if the commission merchant or selling agent withholds from the seller all or part of the proceeds of a sale of the farm products in order to satisfy a debt owed by the seller to the commission merchant or selling agent, unless the debt was secured by a prior perfected security interest.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Conflicting perfected security interests and agricultural liens rank according to priority in time of filing or perfection. Priority dates from the earlier of the time a filing covering the collateral is first made or the security interest or agricultural lien is first perfected, if there is no period thereafter when there is neither filing nor perfection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A perfected security interest or agricultural lien has priority over a conflicting unperfected security interest or agricultural lien.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The first security interest or agricultural lien to attach or become effective has priority if conflicting security interests and agricultural liens are unperfected.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), both of the following apply:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Any supporting obligation for the collateral.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Proceeds of the collateral if all of the following are met:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Subsection (4) applies only if the proceeds of the collateral are not cash proceeds, chattel paper, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property, or letter-of-credit rights.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 9334.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A security interest under this article may be created in goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures. A security interest does not exist under this article in ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   This article does not prevent creation of an encumbrance upon fixtures under real property law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In cases not governed by subsections (4) through (8), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the related real property other than the debtor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (8), a perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property and all of the following are met:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The security interest is a purchase-money security interest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The security interest is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within 20 days thereafter.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the debtor has an interest of record in the real property or is in possession of the real property, and the security interest is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record and has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If before the goods become fixtures, the security interest is perfected by any method permitted by this article and the fixtures are readily removable factory or office machines, readily removable equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real property, or readily removable replacements of domestic appliances that are consumer goods.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If the conflicting interest is a lien on the real property obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the security interest was perfected by any method permitted by this article.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   If the security interest is created in a manufactured home in a manufactured-home transaction and perfected pursuant to a statute described in section 9311(1)(b).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A security interest in fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if either of the following is met:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The encumbrancer or owner has, in an authenticated record, consented to the security interest or disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The debtor has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The priority of the security interest under subsection (6)(b) continues for a reasonable time if the debtor's right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner terminates.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   A mortgage is a construction mortgage to the extent that it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land, including the acquisition cost of the land, if a recorded record of the mortgage so indicates. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (5) and (6), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a construction mortgage if a record of the mortgage is recorded before the goods become fixtures and the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. A mortgage has this priority to the same extent as a construction mortgage to the extent that it is given to refinance a construction mortgage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   A perfected security interest in crops growing on real property has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest or record in or is in possession of the real property.</DIV>

The secured party need not reimburse the holder or owner for any diminution in value of the whole or the other goods caused by the absence of the accession removed or by any necessity for replacing it. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the secured party gives adequate assurance for the performance of the obligation to reimburse.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (6), the other provisions of this part determine the priority of a security interest that attaches to the product or mass under subsection (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If more than 1 security interest attaches to the product or mass under subsection (3), the following rules determine priority:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A security interest that is perfected under subsection (4) has priority over a security interest that is unperfected at the time the collateral becomes commingled goods.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If more than 1 security interest is perfected under subsection (4), the security interests rank equally in proportion to the value of the collateral at the time it became commingled goods.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The office of secretary of state in all other cases, including a case in which the collateral is goods that are or are to become fixtures and the financing statement is not filed as a fixture filing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The office in which to file a financing statement to perfect a security interest in collateral, including fixtures, of a transmitting utility is the office of the secretary of state. The financing statement also constitutes a fixture filing as to the collateral indicated in the financing statement which is or is to become fixtures.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Any financing statement filed under subsection (1)(a) with a register of deeds and any continuation statement, termination statement, amendment, or assignment relating to the financing statement and meeting the formal requisites of this part shall be recorded by the register of deeds, notwithstanding the provisions for witnessing and acknowledging instruments to be recorded in the real property records contained in section 47 of 1846 RS 65, MCL 565.47.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the office of secretary of state receives a financing statement under subsection (1)(b) or (2) for filing, and any debtor identified on the financing statement is an individual, the secretary of state shall provide written notice of the filing of the financing statement to that debtor. The secretary of state shall determine the form of the written notice and the written notice shall contain at least all of the following information:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The debtor's name and address as shown on the financing statement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The secured party's name and address as shown on the financing statement.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   In addition to the written notice described in subsection (4), the secretary of state shall provide at no charge to a debtor described in that subsection a copy or image of the filed financing statement and any attachments. If the debtor requests additional copies or searches, the fees provided in section 9525 apply to that request.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A person shall not knowingly or intentionally file a false or fraudulent financing statement with the office of the secretary of state under subsection (1)(b) or (2). In addition to any other penalty provided by law, a violation of this subsection is a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years or a fine of not more than $2,500.00, or both. If the person is convicted of the violation, the court may find that the financing statement is ineffective and may order the office of the secretary of state to terminate the financing statement and may order restitution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If a person files a false or fraudulent financing statement with the office of the secretary of state under subsection (1)(b) or (2), a debtor named in that financing statement may file an action against the person that filed the financing statement seeking appropriate equitable relief or damages, including, but not limited to, an order declaring the financing statement ineffective and ordering the office of the secretary of state to terminate the financing statement, and reasonable attorney fees.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A person identified as a debtor in a financing statement filed with the secretary of state may file an affidavit with the secretary of state in the form prescribed under subsection (2) stating that the financing statement is fraudulent. A person shall not file an affidavit under this subsection with respect to a financing statement filed by a regulated financial institution or a representative of a regulated financial institution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The secretary of state shall adopt and make available a form affidavit to be used to give notice of a fraudulent financing statement under subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) On receipt of an affidavit under subsection (1), the secretary of state shall terminate the financing statement effective on the date the affidavit is filed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The secretary of state shall not charge a fee to file an affidavit under this section. The secretary of state shall not return any filing fee paid for filing the financing statement, regardless of whether the financing statement is terminated under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The secretary of state shall send notice of the termination of a financing statement under subsection (3) to the filer of the financing statement advising the filer that the financing statement has been terminated. If the filer of the financing statement believes in good faith that the statement was legally filed and is not fraudulent, the filer may file an action to reinstate the financing statement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the court in an action under this section or section 9520(7) determines that the financing statement should be reinstated or accepted, the court shall provide a copy of its order to the secretary of state. On receipt of an order reinstating a financing statement, the secretary of state shall file a record that identifies by its file number the initial financing statement to which the record relates and indicates that the financing statement has been reinstated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) On the filing of a record reinstating a financing statement under subsection (6), the financing statement is effective as a filed record from the initial filing date. If a financing statement that is reinstated would have lapsed during the period of termination, the secured party may file a continuation statement within 30 days after the record reinstating the financing statement is filed. The continuation statement is effective as a filed record from the date the financing statement would have lapsed. However, a financing or continuation statement is not retroactive as provided in this subsection as against a purchaser of the collateral that gives value in reasonable reliance on the absence of the record from the files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the court in an action under this section determines that the financing statement is fraudulent, the filer of the financing statement shall pay the costs and expenses incurred by the person identified as a debtor in the financing statement in the action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An individual who files a materially false or fraudulent affidavit under subsection (1) is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years or a $2,500.00 fine, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) As used in this section, "regulated financial institution" means a financial institution subject to regulatory oversight or examination by a state or federal agency. Regulated financial institution includes a bank, savings bank, savings association, building and loan association, credit union, consumer finance company, industrial bank, industrial loan company, insurance company, investment company, installment seller, mortgage servicer, sales finance company, or leasing company.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A financing statement sufficiently provides the name of the debtor if it meets all of the following that apply to the debtor:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (c), if the debtor is a registered organization or the collateral is held in a trust that is a registered organization, only if the financing statement provides the name that is stated to be the registered organization's name on the public organic record most recently filed with or issued or enacted by the registered organization's jurisdiction of organization which purports to state, amend, or restate the registered organization's name.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Subject to subsection (6), if the collateral is being administered by the personal representative of a decedent, only if the financing statement provides, as the name of the debtor, the name of the decedent and, in a separate part of the financing statement, indicates that the collateral is being administered by a personal representative.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the collateral is held in a trust that is not a registered organization, only if the financing statement does both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Provides 1 of the following as the name of the debtor:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) If the organic record of the trust specifies a name for the trust, the name specified.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) If the organic record of the trust does not specify a name for the trust, the name of the settlor or testator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Meets 1 of the following in a separate part of the financing statement:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) If the name is provided in accordance with subparagraph (i)(A), indicates that the collateral is held in a trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) If the name is provided in accordance with subparagraph (i)(B), provides additional information sufficient to distinguish the trust from other trusts having 1 or more of the same settlors or the same testator and indicates that the collateral is held in a trust, unless the additional information so indicates.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A financing statement may provide the name of more than 1 debtor and the name of more than 1 secured party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The name of the decedent indicated on the order appointing the personal representative of a decedent issued by the court that has jurisdiction over the collateral is sufficient as the "name of the decedent" under subsection (1)(b).</div>

<P>Sec. 9505.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A consignor, lessor, or other bailor of goods, a licensor, or a buyer of a payment intangible or promissory note may file a financing statement, or may comply with a statute or treaty described in section 9311(1), using the terms "consignor", "consignee", "lessor", "lessee", "bailor", "bailee", "licensor", "licensee", "owner", "registered owner", "buyer", "seller", or words of similar import, instead of the terms "secured party" and "debtor".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   This part applies to the filing of a financing statement under subsection (1) and, as appropriate, to compliance that is equivalent to filing a financing statement under section 9311(2), but the filing or compliance is not of itself a factor in determining whether the collateral secures an obligation. If it is determined for another reason that the collateral secures an obligation, a security interest held by the consignor, lessor, bailor, licensor, owner, or buyer which attaches to the collateral is perfected by the filing or compliance.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (2), (5), (6), and (7), a filed financing statement is effective for a period of 5 years after the date of filing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (5), (6), and (7), an initial financing statement filed in connection with a manufactured-home transaction is effective for a period of 30 years after the date of filing if it indicates that it is filed in connection with a manufactured-home transaction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The effectiveness of a filed financing statement lapses on the expiration of the period of its effectiveness unless before the lapse a continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (4). Upon lapse, a financing statement ceases to be effective and any security interest or agricultural lien that was perfected by the financing statement becomes unperfected, unless the security interest is perfected otherwise. If the security interest or agricultural lien becomes unperfected upon lapse, it is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A continuation statement may be filed only within 6 months before the expiration of the 5-year period specified in subsection (1) or the 30-year period specified in subsection (2), whichever is applicable.</div>

Upon the expiration of the 5-year period, the financing statement lapses in the same manner as provided in subsection (3), unless, before the lapse, another continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (4). Succeeding continuation statements may be filed in the same manner to continue the effectiveness of the initial financing statement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a debtor is an organization identified as a transmitting utility and a filed initial financing statement so indicates, the financing statement is effective until a termination statement is filed. A financing statement that is filed before March 29, 2009 is effective for a period of 5 years after the date of filing and shall not be continued under this section if the financing statement indicates either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That the debtor is an individual purporting to be a transmitting utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That the debtor is an individual showing his or her name as an organization and purporting to be a transmitting utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A record of a mortgage that is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing under section 9502(3) remains effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing until the mortgage is released or satisfied of record or its effectiveness otherwise terminates as to the real property.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For purposes of subsection (2), both of the following apply:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A record that does not indicate that it is an amendment or identify an initial financing statement to which it relates, as required by section 9512, 9514, or 9518, is an initial financing statement.</div>

<P>Sec. 9519.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   For each record filed in a filing office, the filing office shall do all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Assign a unique number to the filed record.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Create a record that bears the number assigned to the filed record and the date and time of filing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Maintain the filed record for public inspection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Index the filed record in accordance with subsections (3), (4), and (5).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A file number assigned after January 1, 2002 must include a digit that is mathematically derived from or related to the other digits of the file number, and aids the filing office in determining whether a number communicated as the file number includes a single-digit or transpositional error.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (4) and (5), the filing office shall do both of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Index an initial financing statement according to the name of the debtor and index all filed records relating to the initial financing statement in a manner that associates with one another an initial financing statement and all filed records relating to the initial financing statement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Index a record that provides a name of a debtor that was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the record relates also according to the name that was not previously provided.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a financing statement is filed as a fixture filing or covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, it must be filed for record and the filing office shall index it under both of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Under the names of the debtor and of each owner of record shown on the financing statement as if they were the mortgagors under a mortgage of the real property described.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   To the extent that the law of this state provides for indexing of records of mortgages under the name of the mortgagee, under the name of the secured party as if the secured party were the mortgagee thereunder, or, if indexing is by description, as if the financing statement were a record of a mortgage of the real property described.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a financing statement is filed as a fixture filing or covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, the filing office shall index an assignment filed under section 9514(1) or an amendment filed under section 9514(2) under both of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Under the name of the assignor as grantor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   To the extent that the law of this state provides for indexing a record of the assignment of a mortgage under the name of the assignee, under the name of the assignee.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   To retrieve a record by the name of the debtor and by 1 of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   If the filing office is described in section 9501(1)(a), by the file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates and the date that the record was filed or recorded.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A filing office shall refuse to accept a record for filing for a reason set forth in section 9516(2) or, if the filing office is the secretary of state, subsection (5) and may refuse to accept a record for filing only for a reason set forth in section 9516(2) or, if the filing office is the secretary of state, subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a filing office refuses to accept a record for filing, it shall communicate to the person that presented the record the fact of and reason for the refusal and the date and time the record would have been filed had the filing office accepted it. The communication must be made at the time and in the manner prescribed by filing-office rule but, in the case of a filing office described in section 9501(1)(b), in no event more than 2 business days after the filing office receives the record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A filed financing statement satisfying section 9502(1) and (2) is effective, even if the filing office is required to refuse to accept it for filing under subsection (1). However, section 9338 applies to a filed financing statement providing information described in section 9516(2)(e) that is incorrect at the time the financing statement is filed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a record communicated to a filing office provides information that relates to more than 1 debtor, this part applies as to each debtor separately.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, if a person presents a record to the secretary of state for filing or recording, the secretary of state may refuse to accept the record for filing or recording if 1 or more of the following circumstances exist:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The record is not required or authorized to be filed or recorded with the secretary of state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The record is being filed or recorded for a purpose outside the scope of this article.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The secretary of state has reasonable cause to believe the record is materially false or fraudulent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The record asserts a claim against a current or former employee or officer of a federal, state, county, or other local governmental unit that relates to the performance of the officer's or employee's public duties, and for which the filer does not hold a properly executed security agreement or judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The record indicates that the debtor and the secured party are substantially the same or that an individual debtor is a transmitting utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If an information statement filed with the secretary of state under section 9518 alleges that a previously filed record was wrongfully filed, the secretary of state shall, without undue delay, determine whether the contested record was wrongfully filed. To determine whether the record was wrongfully filed, the secretary of state may require the person who filed the information statement or the secured party to provide any additional relevant information requested by the secretary of state, including an original or copy of a security agreement that is related to the record. If the secretary of state finds that the record was wrongfully filed, the secretary of state shall terminate the record and the record is void and ineffective. The secretary of state shall notify the secured party named in the contested record of the termination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the secretary of state refuses to accept a record for filing or recording under subsection (5), the person who presented the record to the secretary of state may commence an action under section 9501a to require the secretary of state to accept the record for filing or recording. A record ordered by the court to be accepted is effective as a filed record from the initial filing date except as against a purchaser of the collateral that gives value in reasonable reliance on the absence of the record from the files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A filing officer who, acting in a manner that does not subject the filing officer to personal liability under the statutes of this state, improperly refuses to accept a record for filing or recording under subsection (5) is not personally liable for the improper refusal or determination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Subsection (5) does not apply to a financing statement filed by a regulated financial institution or a representative of a regulated financial institution. If a regulated financial institution that is attempting to file a financing statement is organized under the law of a governmental unit other than this state, the secretary of state may request the regulated financial institution or its representative to provide verification of regulation or licensure in the jurisdiction under whose law the institution is organized. As used in this subsection, "regulated financial institution" means that term as defined in section 9501a.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A record is sufficient to disclaim warranties under subsection (5) if it indicates "There is no warranty relating to title, possession, quiet enjoyment, or the like in this disposition" or uses words of similar import.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 9615.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A secured party shall apply or pay over for application the cash proceeds of disposition under section 9610 in the following order:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   To the reasonable expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for disposition, processing, and disposing, and, to the extent provided for by agreement and not prohibited by law, reasonable attorney fees and legal expenses incurred by the secured party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   To the satisfaction of obligations secured by the security interest or agricultural lien under which the disposition is made.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   To the satisfaction of obligations secured by any subordinate security interest in or other subordinate lien on the collateral if both of the following, if applicable, are met:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The secured party receives from the holder of the subordinate security interest or other lien an authenticated demand for proceeds before distribution of the proceeds is completed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   In a case in which a consignor has an interest in the collateral, the subordinate security interest or other lien is senior to the interest of the consignor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   To a secured party that is a consignor of the collateral if the secured party receives from the consignor an authenticated demand for proceeds before distribution of the proceeds is completed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If requested by a secured party, a holder of a subordinate security interest or other lien shall furnish reasonable proof of the interest or lien within a reasonable time. Unless the holder does so, the secured party need not comply with the holder's demand under subsection (1)(c).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A secured party need not apply or pay over for application noncash proceeds of disposition under section 9610 unless the failure to do so would be commercially unreasonable. A secured party that applies or pays over for application noncash proceeds shall do so in a commercially reasonable manner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the security interest under which a disposition is made secures payment or performance of an obligation, after making the payments and applications required by subsection (1) and permitted by subsection (3), both of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Unless subsection (1)(d) requires the secured party to apply or pay over cash proceeds to a consignor, the secured party shall account to and pay a debtor for any surplus.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The obligor is liable for any deficiency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the underlying transaction is a sale of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes, the debtor is not entitled to any surplus, and the obligor is not liable for any deficiency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The surplus or deficiency following a disposition is calculated based on the amount of proceeds that would have been realized in a disposition complying with this part to a transferee other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor if both of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The transferee in the disposition is the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The amount of proceeds of the disposition is significantly below the range of proceeds that a complying disposition to a person other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor would have brought.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   All of the following apply to a secured party that receives cash proceeds of a disposition in good faith and without knowledge that the receipt violates the rights of the holder of a security interest or other lien that is not subordinate to the security interest or agricultural lien under which the disposition is made:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The secured party takes the cash proceeds free of the security interest or other lien.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The secured party is not obligated to apply the proceeds of the disposition to the satisfaction of obligations secured by the security interest or other lien.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The secured party is not obligated to account to or pay the holder of the security interest or other lien for any surplus.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   States the amount of the surplus or deficiency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Provides an explanation in accordance with subsection (3) of how the secured party calculated the surplus or deficiency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   States, if applicable, that future debits, credits, charges, including additional credit service charges or interest, rebates, and expenses may affect the amount of the surplus or deficiency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)   Provides a telephone number or mailing address from which additional information concerning the transaction is available.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Request" means a record that meets all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Authenticated by a debtor or consumer obligor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Requesting that the recipient provide an explanation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   Sent after disposition of the collateral under section 9610.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Send an explanation to the debtor or consumer obligor, as applicable, after the disposition and in accordance with both of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Sent before or when the secured party accounts to the debtor and pays any surplus or first makes written demand on the consumer obligor after the disposition for payment of the deficiency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Sent within 14 days after receipt of a request.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   In the case of a consumer obligor who is liable for a deficiency, within 14 days after receipt of a request, send to the consumer obligor a record waiving the secured party's right to a deficiency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   To comply with subsection (1)(a)(ii), a writing must provide the following information in the following order:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The aggregate amount of obligations secured by the security interest under which the disposition was made, and, if the amount reflects a rebate of unearned interest or credit service charge, an indication of that fact, calculated as of a specified date, that is 1 of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   If the secured party takes or receives possession of the collateral after default, not more than 35 days before the secured party takes or receives possession.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   If the secured party takes or receives possession of the collateral before default or does not take possession of the collateral, not more than 35 days before the disposition.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The amount of proceeds of the disposition.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The aggregate amount of the obligations after deducting the amount of proceeds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The amount, in the aggregate or by type, and types of expenses, including expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for disposition, processing, and disposing of the collateral, and attorney fees secured by the collateral that are known to the secured party and relate to the current disposition.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The amount, in the aggregate or by type, and types of credits, including rebates of interest or credit service charges, to which the obligor is known to be entitled and that are not reflected in the amount in subdivision (a).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The amount of the surplus or deficiency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A particular phrasing of the explanation is not required. An explanation complying substantially with the requirements of subsection (1) is sufficient, even if it includes minor errors that are not seriously misleading.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A debtor or consumer obligor is entitled without charge to 1 response to a request under this section during any 6-month period in which the secured party did not send to the debtor or consumer obligor an explanation pursuant to subsection (2)(a). The secured party may require payment of a charge not exceeding $25.00 for each additional response.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If it is established that a secured party is not proceeding in accordance with this article, a court may order or restrain collection, enforcement, or disposition of collateral on appropriate terms and conditions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to subsections (3), (4), and (6), a person is liable for damages in the amount of any loss caused by a failure to comply with this article. Loss caused by a failure to comply may include loss resulting from the debtor's inability to obtain, or increased costs of, alternative financing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in section 9628, both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A person that, at the time of the failure, was a debtor, was an obligor, or held a security interest in or other lien on the collateral may recover damages under subsection (2) for its loss.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the collateral is consumer goods, a person that was a debtor or a secondary obligor at the time a secured party failed to comply with this part may recover for that failure in any event an amount not less than the credit service charge paid plus 10% of the principal amount of the obligation or the time-price differential paid plus 10% of the cash price.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A debtor whose deficiency is eliminated under section 9626 may recover damages for the loss of any surplus. However, a debtor or secondary obligor whose deficiency is eliminated or reduced under section 9626 may not otherwise recover under subsection (2) for noncompliance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance. Regardless of whether the debtor's or secondary obligor's deficiency is eliminated or reduced under section 9626 or other applicable law, any damages recovered by the debtor or secondary obligor under subsection (3) shall be reduced by the amount that the sum of the secured obligation, expenses, and attorney's fees exceeds the proceeds of collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) In addition to any damages recoverable under subsection (2), the debtor, consumer obligor, or person named as a debtor in a filed record, as applicable, may recover $500.00 in each case from a person that does 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Fails to comply with section 9208.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Fails to comply with section 9209.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Files a record that the person is not entitled to file under section 9509(1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Fails to cause the secured party of record to file or send a termination statement as required by section 9513(1) or (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Fails to comply with section 9616(2)(a) and whose failure is part of a pattern, or consistent with a practice, of noncompliance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Fails to comply with section 9616(2)(b).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A debtor or consumer obligor may recover damages under subsection (2) and, in addition, $500.00 in each case from a person that, without reasonable cause, fails to comply with a request under section 9210. A recipient of a request under section 9210 that never claimed an interest in the collateral or obligations that are the subject of a request under that section has a reasonable excuse for failure to comply with the request within the meaning of this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a secured party fails to comply with a request regarding a list of collateral or a statement of account under section 9210, the secured party may claim a security interest only as shown in the list or statement included in the request as against a person that is reasonably misled by the failure.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The fact that a greater amount could have been obtained by a collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the secured party is not of itself sufficient to preclude the secured party from establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance was made in a commercially reasonable manner.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If action, other than the filing of a financing statement, is taken before this amendatory act takes effect and the action would have resulted in priority of a security interest over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor had the security interest become enforceable before this amendatory act takes effect, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under this amendatory act within 1 year after this amendatory act takes effect. An attached security interest becomes unperfected 1 year after this amendatory act takes effect unless the security interest becomes a perfected security interest under this amendatory act before the expiration of that period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The filing of a financing statement before this amendatory act takes effect is effective to perfect a security interest to the extent the filing would satisfy the applicable requirements for perfection under this amendatory act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   This amendatory act does not render ineffective an effective financing statement that, before this amendatory act takes effect, is filed and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in section 9103 before this amendatory act takes effect. However, except as otherwise provided in subsections (4) and (5) and section 9706, the financing statement ceases to be effective at the earlier of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under the law of the jurisdiction in which it is filed.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The filing of a continuation statement after this amendatory act takes effect does not continue the effectiveness of the financing statement filed before this amendatory act takes effect. However, upon the timely filing of a continuation statement after this amendatory act takes effect and in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in part 3, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed in the same office in that jurisdiction before this amendatory act takes effect continues for the period provided by the law of that jurisdiction.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The filing of an initial financing statement in that office would be effective to perfect a security interest under this amendatory act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The pre-effective-date financing statement was filed in an office in another state or another office in this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The initial financing statement satisfies subsection (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The filing of an initial financing statement under subsection (1) continues the effectiveness of the pre-effective-date financing statement if both of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the initial financing statement is filed before this amendatory act takes effect, for the period provided in section 9403 before this amendatory act takes effect with respect to a financing statement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the initial financing statement is filed after this amendatory act takes effect, for the period provided in section 9515 with respect to an initial financing statement.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4), if the law of this state governs perfection of a security interest, the information in a pre-effective-date financing statement may be amended after this amendatory act takes effect only if 1 of the following is met:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   This amendatory act determines the priority of conflicting claims to collateral.
