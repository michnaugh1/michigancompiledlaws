</P>
<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   By November 1, 2001, and every 10 years thereafter, the legislature shall enact a redistricting plan for the senate and house of representatives. Except as otherwise required by federal law for legislative districts in this state, the redistricting plan shall be enacted using only the following guidelines:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The senate districts shall consist of 38 single-member districts.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The house of representatives districts shall consist of 110 single-member districts. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Senate and house of representatives districts shall be areas of convenient territory contiguous by land. Areas that meet only at the points of adjoining corners are not contiguous.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Senate and house of representatives districts shall have a population not exceeding 105% and not less than 95% of the ideal district size for the senate or the house of representatives unless and until the United States supreme court establishes a different range of allowable population divergence for state legislative districts.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Senate and house of representatives district lines shall preserve county lines with the least cost to the principle of equality of population provided for in subdivision (d).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   If it is necessary to break county lines to stay within the range of allowable population divergence provided for in subdivision (d), the fewest whole cities or whole townships necessary shall be shifted. Between 2 cities or townships, both of which will bring the districts into compliance with subdivisions (d) and (h), the city or township with the lesser population shall be shifted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Within those counties to which there is apportioned more than 1 senate district or house of representatives district, district lines shall be drawn on city and township lines with the least cost to the principle of equality of population between election districts consistent with the maximum preservation of city and township lines and without exceeding the range of allowable divergence provided for in subdivision (d).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   If it is necessary to break city or township lines to stay within the range of allowable divergence provided for in subdivision (d), the number of people necessary to achieve population equality shall be shifted between the 2 districts affected by the shift, except that in lieu of absolute equality the lines may be drawn along the closest street or comparable boundary.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Within a city or township to which there is apportioned more than 1 senate district or house of representatives district, district lines shall be drawn to achieve the maximum compactness possible within a population range of 98% to 102% of absolute equality between districts within that city or township.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)   Compactness shall be determined by circumscribing each district within a circle of minimum radius and measuring the area, not part of the Great Lakes and not part of another state, inside the circle but not inside the district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(k)   If a discontiguous township island exists within an incorporated city or discontiguous portions of townships are split by an incorporated city, the splitting of the township shall not be considered a split if any of the following circumstances exist: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   (i) The city must be split to stay within the range of allowable divergence provided for in subdivision (d) and it is practicable to keep the township together within 1 district. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   (ii) A township island is contained within a whole city and a split of the city would be required to keep the township intact.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   (iii) The discontiguous portion of a township cannot be included in the same district with another portion of the same township without creating a noncontiguous district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   (l) Senate and house districts shall not violate the precedents established in Miller v Johnson, 115 S Ct 2475; 132 L Ed 2d 762 (1995); Bush v Vera, 116 S Ct 1941; 135 L Ed 2d 248 (1996); and, Shaw v Hunt, 116 S Ct 1894; 135 L Ed 2d 207 (1996).</DIV>

  <p><BR><B>History:</B> 1983, Act 256, Eff. Jan. 1, 1986 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> Act 256 of 1983, which purported to reapportion the Legislature, was unconstitutional because it was so altered and amended from the time it was introduced as a bill of housekeeping amendments of the Election Law until it was approved that its original purpose was changed, and because it was passed by the Legislature during a regular session without having been in the possession of each house for at least five days. Anderson v Oakland County Clerk, 419 Mich 313, 353 NW2d 448 (1984).This act violates the second sentence of Const 1963, art 4, § 24, and is therefore unconstitutional.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The legislature finds and declares all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That the state capitol, which was designed by renowned architect Elijah Myers, remains 1 of the most impressive state capitols in the United States. Construction of the state capitol took 6 years, from 1872 to 1878, and it was dedicated to the people of the state of Michigan in 1879, at a cost of $1,500,000.00. From 1989 to 1992, the state capitol underwent a thorough restoration designed to return it to its former beauty and ensure that it continues to serve as the seat of Michigan state government. The restoration was designed to preserve an irreplaceable piece of Michigan history, art, and architecture, while preparing it for another 100 years of service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That the grounds of the state capitol contain monuments that commemorate some of the most important events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and that serve as dramatic reminders of the sacrifices made by many generations to preserve the freedoms enjoyed by those in the twenty-first century, including all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The Grand Army of the Republic Memorial, the First Michigan Sharpshooters Monument, the Engineers Monument, and the statue of Governor Austin Blair, which honor individuals and units involved in the American Civil War.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The Hiker Memorial, which recognizes veterans of the Spanish-American War, the Philippine Insurrection, and the China Relief Expedition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The Michigan Veterans Memorial, which recognizes the contributions and sacrifices of Michigan veterans in World War I, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The Freedom Tree, which honors all those captured and made prisoners of war or missing in action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) That, in 1992, the state capitol was awarded a National Preservation Honor Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the highest such award in the country, recognizing both the challenge and the success of its magnificent restoration. The state capitol has also been designated as a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service, a distinction granted only to the most historically important and significant national sites.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 5.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   All of the following apply to the redistricting plans in sections 1 and 2:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   In adopting the redistricting plans for the house of representatives and the senate, it is the intention of the legislature to comply fully with sections 1 and 1a of 1996 PA 463, MCL 4.261 and 4.261a.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The number of county breaks in the redistricting plans is determined by the following principles:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Breaking a county line means assigning part of the population of a county to 1 or more counties in the formation of a district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   If population is shifted from a county to a single election district, including a district from 2 geographically-separate whole cities or whole townships, there is 1 break. Except as provided in subparagraph (iii), if population from a county is shifted to 2 or more election districts, there are 2 or more breaks.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   If 1 part of a county is shifted to a district and the rest of the county is shifted to another district, there is 1 break.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The number of municipal breaks in the redistricting plans is determined by the following principles:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Breaking a municipal line means assigning part of the population of a municipality to 1 or more municipalities or counties in the formation of a district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   If population is shifted from a municipality to a single election district, there is 1 break. Except as provided in subparagraph (iii), if population from a municipality is shifted to 2 or more election districts, there are 2 or more breaks.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   If 1 part of a municipality is shifted to a district and the rest of the municipality is shifted to another district, there is 1 break.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)   If the boundary of a city, which is located in more than 1 county, is broken in order to preserve a county boundary, that does not count as a municipal break.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The redistricting plans were designed to comply fully with both section 2 of the voting rights act of 1965, Public Law 89-110, 42 U.S.C. 1973, and the requirements of the equal protection clause of amendment XIV of the constitution of the United States, as set forth in Shaw v Reno, 509 US 630 (1993), and subsequent cases concerning racial gerrymandering. In light of these dual obligations, the plans avoid any practice or district lines that result in the denial of any racial or ethnic group's equal opportunity to elect a representative of its choice and, at the same time, does not subordinate traditional redistricting principles for the purpose of accomplishing a racial gerrymander or creating a majority-minority district. As a consequence, the plans do not result in retrogression or dilution of minority voting strength, particularly in light of the demographic limitations caused by relative population losses and the neutral criteria set forth in section 1 of 1996 PA 463, MCL 4.261. However, the plans do not sacrifice traditional neutral principles, such as, most importantly, the Michigan constitutional principles of preservation of county and municipal boundaries, for the purpose of engaging in a gerrymander that unnecessarily favors 1 racial group over others.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The plans further the underlying purpose of the state constitution of 1963 by facilitating effective representation in the legislature where elected representatives can advance the shared interests of unified municipalities or counties. They do so without sacrificing voting rights act of 1965 principles, equal electoral opportunities, or racial fairness.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The redistricting plan for the house of representatives consists of 110 single member districts comprised of convenient territories contiguous by land. All of the following apply to the plan:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The districts range in size between 85,861 and 94,823 residents.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   The number of breaks in county boundaries is 17.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   The number of breaks in city and township lines is 18.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)   The cities of Detroit and Grand Rapids each contain more than 1 whole district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(v)   The range of population divergence between whole districts within the city of Detroit is 167 and within the city of Grand Rapids is 245.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi)   The number of whole cities and townships shifted to form a district with residents of another county is 57.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii)   The number of residents shifted in the cities and townships described in subparagraph (vi) is 364,727.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   The redistricting plan for the senate consists of 38 single member districts comprised of convenient territories contiguous by land. All of the following apply to the senate plan:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The districts range in size between 248,635 and 274,578 residents.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   The number of breaks in county boundaries is 6.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   There are 3 city or township line breaks.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)   The city of Detroit contains more than 1 whole district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(v)   The range of population divergence between whole districts within the city of Detroit is 619.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi)   The number of whole cities and townships shifted to form a district with residents of another county is 26.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii)   The number of residents shifted in the cities and townships described in subparagraph (vi) is 274,180.</DIV>
