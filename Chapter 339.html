</P>
<P>Sec. 203.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The department may issue a license or registration to a person pursuant to a specific article, if the person demonstrates to the satisfaction of the department and a board that the licensure or registration requirements do not constitute a fair and adequate measure of the person's knowledge and skills or that a required examination for receipt of a license or registration does not serve as an adequate basis for determining whether a person could perform an occupation with competence. The procedure to be followed in obtaining the review by the director and a board is prescribed in article 5. A person shall not have a license or registration issued under this section until the person pays the appropriate fees as prescribed in article 4.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A license or registration issued under this article may be issued with a limitation. The department shall notify the appropriate board of the department's intent to impose a limitation on the issuance of a license or registration of a person seeking a license or registration in the occupation for which the board serves. The department may impose the limitation only with the approval of the notified board. However, if the notified board, within 60 days after receipt of the notification by the department, neither approves nor disapproves the imposition of a limitation, the department may impose the limitation. A person who receives a license or registration with a limitation may receive a review of the limitation as provided in section 519.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, a person licensed, registered, or certified under an act repealed by this act to practice an occupation on the day immediately preceding the effective date of this act shall be considered to be appropriately licensed, registered, or certified under this act until the expiration of the licensure, registration, or certification granted under the repealed act.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Unless otherwise provided in this act and subject to the limitations under this section, the department shall renew the license or registration of a person that does all of the following: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Applies to the department on a form provided by the department for renewal of a license or registration. The applicant must deliver the application for renewal to the department on or before the expiration date of the person's current license or registration.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Meets the renewal requirements set forth in a specific article or a rule or order issued under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in this act, a board that requires evidence of attendance in a continuing education program as a condition to license renewal may waive that requirement if, after receiving a written application, the board finds the failure of the licensee to attend was due to the licensee's disability, military service, or absence from the continental United States or due to circumstances beyond the control of the licensee that the board considers sufficient cause to waive the requirement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in article 7, the department may renew a license or registration under this act with a limitation. The department shall notify the appropriate board of the department's intent to impose a limitation on the renewal of a license of a person seeking license renewal in the occupation for which the board serves. The department may impose the limitation only with the approval of the notified board. However, if the notified board, within 30 days after receipt of the notification by the department, does not approve or disapprove the imposition of a limitation, the department may impose the limitation. A person that receives a license or registration renewed with a limitation may receive a review of that limitation under section 519.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) It is the responsibility of the licensee or registrant to renew a license or registration. The department shall send a renewal application to the last known address of a licensee or registrant on file with the department. The failure of a licensee or registrant to notify the department of a change of address does not extend the expiration date of a license or registration and may result in disciplinary action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A licensee or registrant shall report to the department a change in name or mailing address, or a change of electronic mail address if the licensee or registrant has provided an electronic mail address under subsection (6), not later than 30 days after the change occurs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the department is required or permitted under this act to deliver or serve a notice or other communication to a licensee or registrant by mail, the department may deliver or serve the notice or communication by electronic mail rather than by first-class mail if the licensee or registrant has provided an electronic mail address to the department, authorized the department in writing to deliver or serve notices and communications to the licensee or registrant at the electronic mail address, and agreed in writing that the licensee or registrant consents to the service of any notice or communication sent to the electronic mail address that the department would otherwise serve by mail.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to subsection (2), a person that fails to renew a license or registration on or before the expiration date shall not practice the occupation, operate, or use the title of that occupation after the expiration date printed on the license or registration. A license or registration shall lapse on the day after the expiration date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A person that fails to renew a license or registration on or before the expiration date is permitted to renew the license or registration by payment of the required license or registration fee and a late renewal fee within 60 days after the expiration date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in this act, a person that fails to renew a license or registration within the time period set forth in subsection (2) may be relicensed or reregistered without examination and without meeting additional education or training requirements in force at the time of application for relicensure or reregistration if all of the following conditions are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The person applies within 3 years after the expiration date of the last license or registration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The person pays an application processing fee, the late renewal fee, and the per year license or registration fee for the upcoming licensure or registration period, subject to subsection (8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Any penalties or conditions imposed by disciplinary action in this state or any other jurisdiction have been satisfied.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The person submits proof of having completed the equivalent of 1 year of continuing education within the 12 months immediately preceding the date of application or as otherwise provided in a specific article or by rule, if continuing education is required of licensees or registrants under a specific article.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as otherwise provided in this act, a person may be relicensed or reregistered subsequent to 3 or more years after the expiration date of the last license or registration if the person shows that the person meets the requirements for licensure or registration as established by the department in rules or procedures, which may require a person to pass all or part of a required examination, to complete continuing education requirements, or to meet current education or training requirements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Unless otherwise provided in this act, a person that seeks reinstatement of a license or registration shall file an application on a form provided by the department, pay the application processing fee, and file a petition to the department and the appropriate board stating reasons for reinstatement and including evidence that the person can and is likely to serve the public in the regulated activity with competence and in conformance with all other requirements prescribed by law, rule, or an order of the department or board. The procedure for conducting the review of a petition for reinstatement is prescribed in article 5. If approved for reinstatement, the person shall pay the per year license or registration fee for the upcoming license or registration period if appropriate, in addition to completing any requirements imposed under section 203(2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The department shall issue an initial or renewal license or registration not later than 90 days after the applicant files a completed application. The application is considered received on the date the application is received by any agency or department of this state. If the application is considered incomplete by the department, the department shall notify the applicant in writing, or make information electronically available, within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The 90-day period is tolled from the date the department notifies the applicant of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the department. The determination of the completeness of an application does not operate as an approval of the application for the license or registration and does not confer eligibility of an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license or registration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Notwithstanding the time periods described in subsection (6), in the case of a real estate broker and associate broker licensed under article 25, the time period for approval by the department of a completed application is 30 days and the time period for notification sent in writing, or made electronically available, by the department to the applicant regarding an incomplete application is 15 days after the receipt of the application by any agency or department of this state. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the department fails to issue or deny a license or registration within the time required by this section, the department shall return the license or registration fee, and shall reduce the license or registration fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. A failure to issue or deny a license or registration within the time required under this section does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and the department shall place that application, when completed, in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of an application based on the fact that the license or registration fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The director shall submit a report by December 1 of each year to the standing committees and appropriations subcommittees of the senate and house of representatives concerned with occupational issues. The director shall include all of the following information in the report concerning the preceding state fiscal year:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The number of initial and renewal applications the department received and completed within the 90-day time period described in subsection (6) and the 30-day time period described in subsection (7).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The number of applications denied by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The number of applicants that were not issued a license or registration within the applicable time period and the amount of money returned to licensees and registrants under subsection (8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The number of applications denied by the department because of an applicant's lack of good moral character and a summary, by category of offense, of the criminal convictions on which those denials were based. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Subsection (6) does not apply to a license or registration for any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A certified public accountant and registered accountant under article 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An agency non-owner manager of a collection agency under article 9.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A barber, student barber, student instructor, or barber instructor under article 11.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) An employment and consulting agent of a personnel agency under article 10.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A cosmetologist, manicurist, natural hair culturist, esthetician, electrologist, instructor, or registered student under article 12.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A hearing aid salesperson and trainee under article 13.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) A mortuary science licensee, embalmer, or resident trainee in mortuary science under article 18.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) An individual architect, surveyor, or engineer under article 20.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) An individual landscape architect under article 22.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) An individual residential builder and alteration and maintenance contractor or a salesperson for a residential builder and alteration and maintenance contractor under article 24.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) A real estate salesperson under article 25.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) A real estate appraiser under article 26.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Notwithstanding any provision in this act to the contrary, an individual or qualifying officer who is a licensee or registrant under this act and who is mobilized for military duty in the Armed Forces of the United States by the President of the United States is temporarily exempt from any renewal license fee, continuing education requirements, or other related requirements of this act applicable to that license or registration. It is the obligation of the licensee or registrant to inform the department by written or electronic mail of the desire to exercise the temporary exemption under this subsection. If the licensee applying for the temporary exemption is the individual responsible for supervision and oversight of licensed activities, the licensee shall provide notice of arrangements for adequate provision of that supervision and oversight to the department. The licensee or registrant shall accompany the request with proof, as determined by the department, to verify the mobilized duty status. If it receives a request for a temporary exemption under this subsection, the department shall make a determination of the requestor's status and grant the temporary exemption after verification of mobilized duty status under this subsection. A temporary exemption is valid until 90 days after the licensee's or registrant's release from the mobilized duty on which the exemption was based, but shall not exceed 36 months from the date of expiration of the license or registration. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) As used in this section, "completed application" means an application that is complete on its face and submitted with any applicable licensing or registration fees and any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of this state.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A change in ownership or change in location of a funeral establishment, or a change in business entity or change in ownership of a business entity that owns a funeral establishment, automatically cancels its license.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If the applicant is a business entity, the application shall designate which individuals who are control persons of the entity will be performing acts regulated by this article as principals.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A real estate broker shall maintain a place of business in this state. If a real estate broker maintains more than 1 place of business in this state, the real estate broker must obtain a branch office license for each of those additional places of business. If a branch office is located more than 25 miles from the nearest boundary of the municipality in which the main office of the real estate broker is located, the broker shall ensure that the branch office is under the direct supervision of an associate broker.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A passing score on an examination, or on a portion of an examination if the examination is given in separate parts, is valid for 1 year from the date of the examination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The department shall require proof that each applicant for a real estate broker's license, if the applicant is an individual, or each principal if the applicant is a business entity, has the equivalent of 3 years of full-time experience in the business of real estate. All of the following apply in determining whether an individual meets this experience requirement:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For purposes of calculating whether an individual has the equivalent of 3 years of experience, the department shall grant the following credit or credits toward that 3-year requirement:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the individual is a real estate salesperson, 1 year of credit for each 12-month period of licensure in which he or she closed 5 or more real estate transactions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the individual is a builder, 1 year of credit for each 12-month period in which he or she built and personally sold or leased at least 5 residential units, commercial units, or industrial units or a combination of those types of units. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If the individual is a real estate investor, 6 months of credit for each 5 real property transactions personally negotiated for a purchase or sale by the individual for his or her own account, with a maximum of 1 year of credit allowed. However, an individual shall not receive credit under this subdivision if he or she engaged in more than 5 sales in any 12-month period in violation of section 2502b.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to section 411, a person whose license is suspended, revoked, or lapsed, as determined by the records of the department, is considered unlicensed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A person that violates subsection (1) is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $500.00 or imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A person that violates subsection (1) a second time is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 or imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A person that violates subsection (1) a third or subsequent time is guilty of a felony punishable by a fine of not more than $25,000.00 or imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The remedies or penalties imposed for a violation of subsection (1) may include a requirement that restitution be made, based on proofs submitted to and findings made by the trier of fact as provided by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Notwithstanding the existence and pursuit of any other remedy or penalty, an affected person may pursue an action for injunctive relief to restrain or prevent a person from violating subsection (1). If successful in obtaining injunctive relief, the affected person is entitled to actual costs and attorney fees. As used this subsection, "affected person" means a person that is directly affected by the actions of another person that is suspected of violating subsection (1) and includes, but is not limited to, a licensee, a board, the department, a person that has utilized the services of the person suspected of violating subsection (1), or a private association that is composed primarily of members of the occupation in which the person is engaging in or attempting to engage in or in which the person is using a title designated under this act without a license under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If construction is being undertaken contrary to a building permit, this act, or other applicable laws or ordinances, the enforcing agency shall give written notice to the person that holds the building permit, or if a permit has not been issued then to the person doing the construction, notifying that person of the violation of this act, or other applicable laws and ordinances, and that the person should appear and show cause why the construction should not be stopped. If the person doing the construction is not known, or cannot be located with reasonable effort, the enforcing agency may deliver the notice to the individual in charge of, or apparently in charge of, the construction. If the holder of the permit or the person doing the construction fails to appear and show good cause within 1 full working day after notice is delivered, the enforcing agency shall cause a written order to stop construction to be posted on the premises. A person shall not continue, or cause or allow to be continued, construction in violation of a stop construction order, except with permission of the enforcing agency to abate the dangerous condition or remove the violation, or except by court order. If an order to stop construction is not obeyed, the enforcing agency may apply to the circuit court for the county in which the premises are located for an order enjoining the violation of the stop construction order. This remedy is in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedy provided by law or ordinance, and does not prevent criminal prosecution for failure to obey the order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An investigation may be conducted under article 5 to enforce this section. A person that violates this section is subject to this section and sections 511, 603, and 611.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The remedies under this section are independent and cumulative. The use of 1 remedy by a person does not bar the use of other lawful remedies by that person or the use of a lawful remedy by another person.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If a conviction under subsection (3), (4), or (5) is entered by a court, the court shall notify the department by mail, facsimile transmission, or electronic mail.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The attorney general or the prosecuting attorney of a county may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce this section.</div>
