<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   When land shall be detached from any city, township or village in this state and attached to any city, township or village, as in the first section of this act provided, and a special assessment district or districts shall have been created and a special assessment roll or rolls shall have been made and special assessments levied thereon by such city, township or village prior to the detachment therefrom of land as aforesaid, and the same shall not have been paid in full, such city, township or village from which such land is detached or to which such land is annexed may create a new assessment district or districts out of the territory of such special assessment district or districts so attached or remaining, as the case may be, and may make a new assessment roll, and charge the property of such assessment district or districts or the owner or owners thereof with the payment of the whole or any portion of the special assessment unpaid; Provided, That in case any part of the assessment so made upon any lot or parcel of land shall have been paid in whole or in part, the said lot or parcel of land in said assessment district or districts shall be credited with the payment thereof upon such new assessment roll, or a certified copy of such special assessment roll may be made by the city, township or village having the custody thereof, and when so made shall be turned over to the municipality to which land has been annexed or detached, as the case may be, as aforesaid; and the collection of the said special assessment upon said assessment district or districts so divided shall be continued in all respects according to law by the proper officer of each of said municipalities upon the portion of the assessment district or districts within either of said municipalities after such annexation or detachment of land as aforesaid; or if the whole of any special assessment district or districts so created as aforesaid shall be annexed to another municipality, a new special assessment may be made upon the territory of the original assessment district or districts by the municipality to which said special assessment district or districts shall have been annexed, and the assessment collected in the same manner as special assessments are collected by such municipality; or the original assessment roll made by the municipality from which the land shall have been taken as aforesaid may be used by the municipality to which the assessment district or districts has been annexed, upon which to collect the assessment or any part thereof; or where any tax whatever has been levied by a municipality and subsequently part of the territory of such municipality shall have been annexed to another municipality, and said tax or any part thereof shall remain uncollected and unpaid, a certified copy of the tax roll shall be made by the municipality having the custody thereof and turned over to the municipality to which a part of such territory has been annexed, and said tax shall then be collected by the proper officer of each of said municipalities upon the portion of territory within the jurisdiction of each, and in case the whole of the territory of a municipality is taken by being annexed to another municipality or a new municipality created therefrom, the tax roll of the municipality making the same may be used by such municipality or the municipality to which such land is annexed, and the tax collected in the same manner as other taxes are collected by municipalities under the law. Where a special assessment district shall have been charged with the payment of money evidenced by bond issue or otherwise and the same shall have been divided by the detachment of land as aforesaid, and the authorities of each of the municipalities are unable to agree upon the division and assumption of said bond issue or other indebtedness, then the circuit court in chancery of the county wherein is located the municipality to which land has been attached shall have the power to apportion the payment of said bonds or other evidence of indebtedness between the said special assessment district or districts, according to the proportion each part of said special assessment district or districts should bear when divided as aforesaid. If for any reason any special or general assessment or tax levy in this act enumerated shall be declared void by a court of competent jurisdiction on account of any error or omission in the proceedings had or taken in making such special or general assessment or tax levy, the common council or other proper authority of such municipality shall cause a re-assessment to be made upon the original assessment district or so much thereof as is within its jurisdiction, in the same manner and with like effect as assessments of like character are made by such municipality for general and special purposes under the charter and laws of such municipality; nor shall any assessment herein mentioned be held invalid by any court on account of any defect or omission in the proceedings had or taken in the making of said assessment, unless the person or persons complaining thereof be required to pay such sum or sums as said court may find the property assessed in said assessment roll shall have been benefited by the making of such assessment. The said circuit court in chancery is hereby given full and ample power to determine and adjudicate every question which may arise under the provisions of this act, where provision for the solution of such question is not herein already made. The foregoing act as in this section amended shall apply and be applicable to all cases where the boundaries of cities, townships or villages have been heretofore changed or may hereafter be changed, in the manner specified in section 1 of this act.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The owner or owners of any such area of land who desire such disconnection shall file a petition in the circuit court of the county where the land, or the greater part thereof, is situated, and in such petition shall allege facts in support of such disconnection. The particular city or village shall be made defendant, and it, or any taxpayer resident in such municipality, may appear and defend against such petition. If the court finds that the allegations of the petition are true and that the petitioner has met the qualifications as set forth in section 1 hereof, then such area of land shall be entitled to disconnection under the provisions of this act, and the court shall order said land disconnected from such city or village. In case of the disconnection from a city of any land which previously constituted a part of 1 or more townships, such land shall thereupon attach to and become a part of such township or townships, which shall be specified in the judgment. In case of the disconnection of any other land, the court shall determine and specify in the judgment what township or townships such land shall attach to and become a part of: Provided, however, That if by reason of city or village owned sewers, sidewalks, highways, water mains, gas mains, or other public improvements, upon or abutting said property, it would be inequitable to such city or village to grant said petition, in such case only may the court in its discretion deny the same even though petitioner has met the qualifications set forth in section 1 hereof.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A municipal corporation, referred to in this act as a corporation, authorized by law to sell water outside of its territorial limits, may contract for the sale of water with a city, village, township, or authority authorized to provide a water supply for its inhabitants.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The price charged by the city to its customers shall be at a rate which is based on the actual cost of service as determined under the utility basis of ratemaking. This subsection shall not remove any minimum or maximum limits imposed contractually between the city and its wholesale customers during the remaining life of the contract. This subsection shall not apply to a water system that is not a contractual customer of another water department and that serves less than 1% of the population of the state. This subsection shall take effect with the first change in wholesale or retail rate by the city or its contractual customers following the effective date of this subsection. Any city that has not adjusted rates in conformity with this subsection by April 1, 1982 shall include in the next ensuing rate period an adjustment to increase or decrease rates to wholesale or retail customers, so that each class of customer pays rates which will yield the same estimated amount of revenue as if the rate adjustment had been retroactive to April 1, 1982. A city that is subject to section 5e of Act No. 279 of the Public Acts of 1909, being section 117.5e of the Michigan Compiled Laws, shall begin proceedings to determine rate changes pursuant to section 5e(b) of Act No. 279 of the Public Acts of 1909, being section 117.5e of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The retail rate charged to the inhabitants of a city, village, township, or authority which is a contractual customer as provided by subsection (2) shall not exceed the actual cost of providing the service.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   This act shall not apply to a jointly operated water system or authority that supplies raw untreated water to 2 or more municipalities.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whenever 2 or more cities in Michigan determine to extend and improve their municipally owned water systems through the acquisition of an additional source of water supply consisting of a water supply line from one of the great lakes, bays thereof, and connecting waters between, together with related pumping station or stations, intake, meters, valves, rights of way, real estate and appurtenant apparatus and equipment (all of which are hereinafter referred to as the "source of supply"), such cities may jointly acquire, own and operate such source of supply, or any part thereof, and each such city may finance all or part of its agreed share of the cost thereof through the issuance of its water revenue bonds under the provisions of Act No. 94 of the Public Acts of 1933, as such act now exists or may hereafter be amended. The governing bodies of such cities are hereby empowered to enter into such agreements for the acquisition, operation, control, management and improvement of such source of supply (any which agreement may run for a term of years) as they may in their discretion see fit, including, but without limitation, agreements with each other, with water customers and with any board, agency or commission in which may be imposed the operation of the source of supply. Such agreements may provide for and fix the membership, powers and duties of a joint board, agency or commission to operate the source of supply, in which event the governing bodies may delegate to such board, agency or commission such of their powers with respect to the operation of the source of supply as they may see fit. Such board, agency or commission is empowered to enter into such agreements with said cities and with water consumers, including other cities, villages and public corporations, for the sale of water thereto and with respect to the operation of the source of supply, as may be consistent with the provisions of the agreements creating such board, agency or commission and as it may consider advantageous. The expense of the operation, maintenance, management, control and improvement of the source of supply may be paid either through the sale of water by the operating board to the cities and other customers, or by contributions to be made by the respective cities, or both, all as may be provided in the agreements between the cities, as originally entered into or as modified and supplemented from time to time.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 11.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   After the effective date of the 2002 amendatory act that added this section, a qualified authority shall not enter into or extend any contract, obligation, bond, or note that has, or as extended would have, a termination date after the termination date of the authority's most recently approved contract under section 5(1), unless the contract, obligation, bond, or note or extension thereof, is approved by all members.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Within 90 days after a qualified authority decides to sell or transfer real property located within the territory of a member or former member, the member or former member may exercise the right of first refusal to purchase the real property at a price not less than the greater of the real property's current market value or the highest price offered for the real property in an arm's length, bona fide offer by a third party. The current market value of such real property shall be determined by an appraiser acceptable to the authority and the interested member. Any dispute regarding a determination of current market value shall be resolved by independent arbitration.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Unless its withdrawal would cause an impairment of any contract, a member may withdraw from a qualified authority if all of the following requirements are met:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The legislative body of the member adopts a resolution stating that the authority is no longer effectively serving the member's needs and declaring its decision to withdraw from the authority on a date specified in the resolution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The withdrawal date specified in the resolution under subdivision (a) is not either of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Less than 60 days after the date the resolution is adopted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Within 1 year before the termination date of the authority's most recently approved contract under section 5(1) unless the filings required by subdivision (c) are made more than 1 year before the specified withdrawal date.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The clerk of the member promptly files a certified copy of the resolution adopted under subdivision (a) with the authority and the secretary of state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   By the withdrawal date, the withdrawing member, at its option, either shall pay to the authority the amount of the withdrawing member's fair share of the negative equity of the authority, if any, determined as of the withdrawal date, or shall provide the authority with a bond or other independent, insured guarantee that any such amount will be paid not later than 30 days after the expiration date of the authority's most recently approved contract under section 5(1). This subsection does not relieve the withdrawing member from either of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The member's fair share of any obligation to reimburse the authority following the member's withdrawal for any environmental liabilities subsequently incurred by the authority, to the extent that the environmental liabilities result from the authority's disposal of the withdrawn former member's municipal solid waste, recyclable materials, or yard waste.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The member's payment of any money damages, owed on account of its or the authority's default under a contract under section 6 if the default and damages result directly and solely from the member's withdrawal and are necessary to prevent an impairment of the contract. If 2 or more members withdraw, they are jointly liable for damages under this subdivision.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The member's fair share of any obligation to reimburse the authority following the member's withdrawal for liability incurred by the authority as a result of litigation or arbitration proceedings that were initiated before the date of withdrawal, or litigation or arbitration involving a cause of action arising before the date of withdrawal, if the total amount of the member's fair share of the obligation cannot be exactly determined by the date of withdrawal.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   At the option of the authority, by the withdrawal date, the authority shall pay to the withdrawing member the withdrawing member's fair share of the equity of the authority, determined as of the withdrawal date, or shall provide the withdrawing member with a bond or other independent, insured guarantee that such amount will be paid no later than 30 days after the expiration date of the authority's most recently approved contract under section 5(1). If an authority elects to provide such a bond or other guarantee, the withdrawn former member may direct the bonding company or guarantor at any time thereafter to pay from the bond or other guarantee any obligation or liability owed to the authority by the withdrawn former member, including, but not limited to, an obligation described in subsection (4)(a) or (b).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Unless it would cause an impairment of an authority contract under section 6, a qualified authority shall dissolve if both of the following requirements are met:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The legislative bodies of 60% of the members, weighted by the percentage of recent waste delivery, each adopt a resolution stating that the authority is no longer effectively serving the public good for which it was created and directing that the authority be dissolved pursuant to this subsection and subsections (7) to (9).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The clerk of each member whose legislative body adopts a resolution under subdivision (a) promptly files a certified copy of the resolution with the authority and the secretary of state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Within 6 months after the requirements of subsection (6) are met, the qualified authority shall establish a mechanism to manage and pay for environmental activities required under existing law and cease the activities described in section 1 for which it was incorporated. Within 6 months after ceasing activities described in section 1, the authority shall settle its accounts, including, but not limited to, all vested or accrued employee benefits, employment contracts, collective bargaining agreements, and unemployment compensation, and, subject to subsection (2), shall sell all of its property. In addition, the authority shall establish a mechanism for handling future environmental liabilities. A qualified authority with respect to which the requirements of subsection (6) have been met and a new authority incorporated under subsection (10) may agree to the assignment of contracts from the qualified authority to the new authority.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   After the requirements of subsection (7) are met, the qualified authority shall distribute to each member that member's fair share of the authority's remaining assets.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   Upon distribution of the qualified authority's assets under subsection (8), both of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The authority is dissolved.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   All liabilities of each member and former member of the authority are terminated, except for both of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Any environmental liabilities attributed to the authority to the extent that the environmental liabilities result from the authority's disposal of the member's or former member's fair share of municipal solid waste, recyclable materials, or yard waste.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   The member's fair share of any obligation to reimburse the authority following the dissolution for liability incurred by the authority as a result of litigation or arbitration proceedings that were initiated before the date of dissolution, or litigation or arbitration involving a cause of action arising before the date of dissolution, if the total amount of the member's fair share of the obligation cannot be exactly determined by the time the requirements of subsection (7) are met.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   Subsections (6) to (9) do not prevent the incorporation of a new authority by some or all of the members or former members of an authority with respect to which the requirements of subsection (6) have been met.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   If, after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this section, a qualified authority is incorporated or amends its articles of incorporation, the qualified authority shall include in its articles the provisions of subsections (3) to (9).</DIV>

Any such public market shall be divided into 2 distinct areas. One area shall be devoted exclusively to facilities for the wholesale marketing of farm products as hereinafter defined. The other area shall be devoted to the wholesale marketing of food products and the authority shall have no interest in such area, or any part thereof, which is actually made use of but said authority may limit the type and nature of the use to be made of the whole or any part thereof in its conveyance of the real property which is sold to any person, firm, partnership or corporation. The authority shall have no interest in any improvements on the land or any part thereof of the area known as the food products marketing area.</DIV>

Said ordinance shall fix the method of selecting the board of directors of said authority, the number thereof, which shall not be less than 5 nor more than 9, the qualifications of members of said board and their terms and compensation, if any. A city establishing a market authority as herein provided shall have power to appropriate such moneys from the general fund as may be required in addition to funds available from revenue bonds of the authority to insure the successful maintenance and operation of said market. In the event that any profit shall accrue from the operation of said market over and above payments required to be made on principal and interest on the bonds or for funds required to be established for the payment of said bonds and above costs of operation, such profit shall be transferred to the general fund of the city. Any construction, repair or ornamentation as respects the market shall be governed by the provisions of Act No. 187 of the Public Acts of 1905, as amended, being sections 570.101 to 570.105, inclusive, of the Compiled Laws of 1948.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 11.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The acquirement of a water supply, sewage disposal or refuse system, or the making of lake improvements or erosion control systems, or the improvement, enlargement, or extension of any of these may be financed by 1 or more of the following methods:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   By the issuance of revenue bonds under the revenue bond act of 1933, 1933 PA 94, MCL 141.101 to 141.140, or any other applicable act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   By the issuance of bonds in anticipation of payments to become due under contracts where 1 or more municipalities agree to pay to the county operating under this act certain sums toward the cost of the acquisition, improvement, enlargement, or extension of a project that may be made under this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   By the issuance of bonds in anticipation of the payment of special assessments made by the board of public works.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   By money advanced by a county operating under this act under agreements with a municipality or municipalities for the repayment of the money.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   By money advanced, from time to time, before or during construction of a project by a public corporation, in which event the county operating under this act shall reimburse the corporation, with interest not to exceed 8% per annum or without interest as may be agreed, when funds are available for that purpose. The obligation of the county to make the reimbursement may be evidenced by a contract or note, the contract or note may be made payable out of the payments to be made by municipalities, under contracts as described in section 12 or 15, or out of the proceeds of bonds issued under this act by the county or out of any other available funds. The contract or note is not subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Bonds issued under this act shall be authorized by an ordinance or a resolution approved by the board of public works and adopted by the county board of commissioners of the county operating under this act. The county board of commissioners is authorized by a 3/5 vote of its members elect, to pledge the full faith and credit of the county for the prompt payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds issued pursuant to this act. The county's full faith and credit may be pledged to the payment of principal and interest on revenue bonds issued under subsection (1)(a). If it becomes necessary for the county operating under this act to advance any money, other than its share of the cost of the project, for the payment of principal and interest, then it shall be entitled to reimbursement from any surplus from time to time existing in the fund from which the principal and interest are primarily payable. If the faith and credit of the county is pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on any bonds issued under this act, the county may, in the case of insufficiency of funds primarily pledged for the payment, pay the funds from its general fund or levy taxes without limitation as to rate or amount in addition to any other taxes that the county is authorized to levy but not in excess of the rate or amount necessary to make up the deficiency. The bonds shall be issued in the name of the county and shall be executed by the chairperson of the county board of commissioners and its county clerk, who shall also cause their facsimile signatures to be affixed to the interest coupons to be attached to the bonds. The county clerk shall also affix to the bonds the seal of the county. Bonds issued under this act are negotiable instruments and shall be serial bonds payable annually, with the first maturity due not more than 5 years and the last maturity not more than 40 years from the date of issue. This subsection shall apply to special assessment bonds as well as other bonds. Annual maturity payable after 5 years from the date of the bonds shall not be less than 1/4 of the amount of any subsequent maturity on the same series of bonds. The bonds shall bear interest at not more than the maximum rate permitted by the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821, payable semiannually except that the first coupon may be for any number of months not exceeding 10. The bonds and coupons shall be made payable in lawful money of the United States of America and shall be exempt from all taxation by this state or by any taxing authority within this state. The county board of commissioners may authorize the board of public works to sell the bonds in accordance with the laws of this state.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 12.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A county operating under this act and any 1 or more municipalities including the county itself may enter into a contract or contracts for the acquisition, improvement, enlargement, or extension of a water supply, a sewage disposal, or a refuse system, or the making of lake improvements or erosion control systems and for the payment of the costs by the contracting municipalities, with interest, over a period not exceeding 40 years.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In the contract, each contracting municipality may pledge its full faith and credit for the payment of its obligations under the contract. If the municipality has taxing power, it may each year levy a tax in an amount that will be sufficient for the prompt payment of all or part of the contract obligations due before the following year's tax collection. If the contract or an unlimited tax pledge in support of the contract has been approved by the electors, the tax may be in addition to any tax that the municipality may otherwise be authorized to levy and may be imposed without limitation as to rate or amount but shall not be in excess of the rate or amount necessary to pay the contract obligation. The contract is not subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821. For the payment of contractual obligations incurred under this act, a township shall levy a tax only on the taxable property in the unincorporated areas of the township unless the township and a village have agreed that a part of the capacity in the county system allocated to the township by contract pursuant to this act will be used to serve areas in a village located wholly or partly within the township and the village has not itself agreed to purchase the capacity in the county system. If a contracting municipality at the time of its annual tax levy has on hand in cash any amount pledged to the payment of the current obligations for which the tax levy is to be made, then the annual tax levy may be reduced by that amount. For the purpose of obtaining the credit, funds may be raised by a municipality by using 1 or more of the following methods:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   By service charges to users of the system or lake improvements.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   By special assessment upon lands benefited.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   By the exaction of charges for the connection of properties, directly or indirectly, to the system or for the availability of the system to serve properties, directly or indirectly, or at a present or future time.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   By setting aside any state collected funds disbursed to the municipality and usable therefor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   By setting aside any other available money.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   For the purpose of obtaining the credit, municipalities contracting for the acquisition, improvement, enlargement, or extension of an erosion control system shall levy special assessments upon all lands benefited to cover not less than 3/4 of the total project cost contracted for by the local unit. A municipality may agree to raise all or any part of its contract obligation by any of the methods provided in this section that are available. The powers in this act granted to any municipality shall be exercised by its governing body. A contract entered into before May 12, 1959, which complies with this act, is validated.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A contract or assessment made under this act may provide that if a municipality shall fail to pay to a county operating under this act any amount required to be paid under any contract or assessment when due, then the county treasurer shall notify the state treasurer, or other appropriate disbursing official, who is hereby directed to deduct the amount from any moneys in his possession belonging to the municipality which are not pledged to the payment of debts, but the state treasurer or other official shall not withhold in any 1 year a sum greater than 25% of the total amount owed the county by the delinquent municipality as stated in the notice from the county treasurer. Nothing in this section shall permit the deduction of moneys in contravention of the constitution, but a municipality itself may authorize, in any contract with a county operating under this act, the deduction and transfer from moneys derived from unrestricted state funds returnable to the municipality.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A county, city, village, or township for itself and any other of the units of government may acquire, construct, lease, or maintain a building or buildings to house any of their offices, or facilities for any other public use and purpose of the units of government, which building may be or include a memorial hall for war veterans of the United States of America and for public assemblage and to acquire a site or sites for those purposes. However, no county, city, village, or township shall for joint purposes and uses acquire a site or sites or erect any building or buildings unless the unit of government has entered into a contract or contracts for the rental of a portion of the site or sites and quarters or space with each of the other participating units of government in the amount or amounts and for the period or periods of time and in the form as will provide revenues from payments to it of a reasonably proportionate or equitable share of the total cost in relation to the portion, space, use, and public benefits provided in the contract or contracts for the lessee or lessees. The contract or contracts shall be executed following approval by a majority vote of the members elected to and serving in the legislative body of each unit of government participating in and a party to the contract. The contract is not subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The county, city, village, or township that singly acquires a site or sites or acquires, constructs, or leases a building or buildings for the purposes authorized in this section may obtain funds for those purposes by gift or by means of general obligation bonds or by the issuance of self-liquidating revenue bonds to be paid from the revenues derived in pursuance of a contract or contracts as provided in subsection (1) and under the provisions of the revenue bond act of 1933, 1933 PA 94, MCL 141.101 to 141.140. In the event that the revenues to be derived under the contract or contracts shall be only sufficient to permit the issuance of revenue bonds for a portion of the cost of the site or sites or building or buildings, authority is hereby granted to issue revenue bonds to the extent to which the revenue shall permit. However, the entire improvement or improvements on which revenue bonds are issued shall be subject to the provisions of the revenue bond act of 1933, 1933 PA 94, MCL 141.101 to 141.140. However, as a prerequisite to the lease or purchase of any property, the lease, purchase, or construction of any building or buildings or the issuance of any revenue or general obligation bonds under the provision of this section, the board of commissioners of the county involved shall submit the question to the qualified electors of the county at the next general election or at a special election to be called by the board of commissioners of the county. However, if the majority vote of the qualified electors in the largest city of the county and a majority vote of the qualified electors in all the rest of the county shall vote in favor of the question, the provisions of this section shall then become operative. However, no self-liquidating revenue bonds shall be sold unless prior to the sale an advertisement is made of the date of the sale, the number and amount of bonds, and other matters covering the revenue bonds. However, sealed bids shall be taken on the day of the sale of the bonds from any and all persons who may bid, and the bonds shall be sold to the highest bidder at the sale. The proceeds derived from the sale of any and all the bonds shall be used only for the purpose of acquiring a site or constructing building or buildings, as authorized in this act, and shall be used for no other purpose.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The provisions of this section shall apply only to counties having a population of 300,000 or over according to the latest federal census. However, the provisions of this section shall not apply in a county unless and until the board of supervisors of the county shall adopt a resolution approved by a 2/3 vote of the members elected to and serving on the board.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 8a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The incorporating unit or units contracting under this act shall in the contract of lease agree to pay to the authority, as cash rental for the property, periodic amounts or their designated shares of periodic amounts that are sufficient to enable the authority to pay the principal of and the interest on the authorized bonds when due either at maturity of the bonds, or, in the case of term bonds, by the required prior redemption or maturity of the bonds. The incorporating unit or units may also agree to pay the costs and expenses of operation and maintenance of the property and the operating expenses of the authority including expenses incidental to the issuance and payment of the bonds. The obligations set forth in this subsection shall, unless specifically stated to the contrary in the contract of lease, be general obligations of the incorporating unit or units.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If bonds are issued by the authority in anticipation of a full faith and credit contractual general obligation of the incorporating unit or units to pay the cash rental, as provided in this section, then the incorporating unit or units shall levy each year ad valorem taxes that are necessary for the payment of the cash rental in anticipation of which bonds are issued. These taxes may be levied without limitation as to rate or amount and shall be in addition to any other taxes that the incorporating unit or units may otherwise be authorized to levy, but not in an amount or at a rate exceeding that necessary to pay the contractual obligation. If the incorporating unit or units, at the time prescribed by law for the making of a tax levy, have other funds on hand that have been set aside and earmarked for payment of its obligations for which a tax levy would otherwise have to be made, then the tax levy shall be reduced by the amount of the other funds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The incorporating unit or units may raise and provide other funds from any lawful source, including but not limited to money received from the state or other governmental entity for use to pay rental to the authority, from the sublease or contract for the use of the property by any person, firm, or corporation, or from revenues earned by the incorporating unit from operation of the property. The contract of lease may provide the obligation of the incorporating unit for the payment of the cash rental shall not be subject to setoff by the incorporating unit nor shall there be an abatement of the cash rentals for any cause including, but not limited to, casualty that results in the property being untenantable.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Proceedings for consolidation may be initiated by the filing of a petition with the commission signed by a number of registered electors who are residents of 1 or more of the affected municipalities at least equal to 5% of the total population of the affected municipalities:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Provided, however, That no new city may be created by the consolidation process unless at least 1 of the municipalities to be consolidated is an incorporated city.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Any township having a common boundary that is contiguous with a city or village proposed for consolidation may be included in the consolidation if no village is incorporated within the territorial boundaries of the township or, if 1 or more villages are incorporated within the territorial boundaries of the township, then such village or villages shall be included within the consolidation. When any township is included in a consolidation, the term "municipality" as used in sections 12 to 17 shall include the township and the procedures set forth in such sections shall be altered as may be necessary to provide for the township.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The petition shall name the municipalities proposed to be consolidated and shall request the commission to take the proceedings necessary for consolidation under this act. The commission shall reject a petition for consolidation if a proposition to consolidate the identical municipalities has been voted on within the 2 years immediately preceding the filing of the later petition.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the commission finds that a petition does not conform to the provisions of this act, Act No. 278 of the Public Acts of 1909, as amended, or of Act No. 279 of the Public Acts of 1909, as amended, to the extent that provisions thereof are not superseded by this act, or to the rules promulgated by the commission, the commission shall return the petition to the person from whom it was received together with a certified copy of its reasons for rejecting the petition. If the commission finds that the petition is proper it shall proceed in the manner specified for the processing of petitions which propose incorporation.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a proposed consolidation includes a portion of a township, the term "municipality" as defined in sections 1 and 12 when used in this section and sections 14, 15, and 17 means only that portion included within the proposed consolidated city. Except as provided in subsection (2), when its order approving a proposed consolidation becomes final, the commission shall call an election of 9 charter commissioners who shall be registered electors of the municipalities proposed for consolidation, each having a residence of at least 2 years in the municipality from which he or she is to be elected immediately before the election. The commission shall determine the number of charter commissioners to be elected from each municipality proposed for consolidation, which number shall be as nearly proportionate as possible to the municipality's population. Each municipality proposed for consolidation is entitled to a minimum of 1 charter commissioner, regardless of population. If charter commissioners are elected at the same election at which the proposition to consolidate is submitted, the election of the charter commissioners is void if the proposition to consolidate is not adopted. If charter commissioners are not elected at the election at which the proposition to consolidate is submitted they shall be elected at a separate election to be held within 60 days after a favorable vote on the proposition to consolidate, which election date shall be set by the commission. A municipal officer or employee, elected or appointed, shall not be eligible for election to the charter commission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The municipalities proposed for consolidation may, by resolution of their respective governing bodies, choose to appoint their charter commissioners pursuant to this subsection. If the municipalities proposed for consolidation choose to appoint their charter commissioners pursuant to this subsection, the commission, when its order approving a proposed consolidation becomes final, shall instruct the governing bodies of the municipalities proposed for consolidation to appoint not less than 8 and not more than 10 charter commissioners. The governing body of each municipality proposed for consolidation shall appoint an equal number of charter commissioners. The appointees for charter commissioner shall be residents of the municipalities from which they are to be appointed for not less than 2 years immediately preceding the appointment and shall also be registered electors in the municipalities from which they are to be appointed. The charter commissioners shall be appointed within 180 days after the commission's order approving a proposed consolidation becomes final as determined pursuant to section 12a(3). A municipal officer or employee, elected or appointed, shall not be eligible for appointment to the charter commission. This subsection shall apply to all municipalities whose proposals for consolidation are approved by the commission after January 1, 1982.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The contents or language of the articles of incorporation under this act shall be a permissive subject of collective bargaining between the local government and a bargaining representative of its employees. If the local government and a bargaining representative of its employees engage in collective bargaining before the articles of incorporation are approved and the local government and that bargaining representative reach an agreement on issues that would obligate an entity that will function as an employer in the authority, the articles of incorporation shall include those obligations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Nothing in this act creates an employment relationship between the existing employees of the local government and the proposed authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An authority is effective through its articles of incorporation at least 180 days before the actual transfer of personnel and equipment. Before the authority's effective date, the local government shall affirm in writing to the authority those employees, if any, who will be transferred to the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If any employees who are transferred to the authority are represented by a labor organization, those employees are subject to their previous terms and conditions of employment until those terms and conditions of employment are modified in accordance with 1947 PA 336, MCL 423.201 to 423.217, or for 6 months after the transfer to the authority, whichever is earlier. Negotiations on a collective bargaining agreement with an authority shall begin no later than 180 days before the date the employees, if any, transfer to the authority.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) This section does not limit the rights of employees, under applicable law, to assert that a bargaining representative protected by subsection (6) is no longer their representative. The employees of the authority are eligible as of the day the authority becomes effective through its articles of incorporation to choose their representative under 1947 PA 336, MCL 423.201 to 423.217. This subsection does not extend the time limits as provided in subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If multiple labor organizations assert the right to represent all or part of the authority's workforce or where a substantial portion of the transferred employees were not previously represented, in the absence of a voluntary mutual agreement, at the request of any party or on the initiative of the Michigan employment relations commission, the Michigan employment relations commission shall conduct a representation election.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) In the absence of a voluntary mutual agreement, the authority's workforce shall be merged by using a single seniority list for each of the same or similar classifications.

Disputes concerning the single seniority list or use of the single seniority list shall be heard by a single arbitrator appointed by the Michigan employment relations commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Nothing in this section requires a local government or an authority to assume a collective bargaining agreement between another local government and its employees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) An employee who left the employ of the local government to enter the military service of the United States shall have the same employment rights as to the local government or the authority as he or she would have had under 1951 PA 263, MCL 35.351 to 35.356.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An authority and the local government comprising the authority may enter into a contract providing for the construction, acquisition, improvement, enlargement, or extension of a lighting system, including the payment of engineering, legal, and financing expenses in connection with the lighting system, and after the establishment of the initial service rates and the execution of contracts for the provision of construction services, purchase of power, and other related activities within the corporate limits of the authority. Contracts shall provide for the rates and charges for the local government. The local government may pledge its full faith and credit for the payment of the obligation in the manner and times specified in the contract. If the local government makes this pledge, it may include in its annual tax levy an amount sufficient so the estimated collections from the tax levy will be sufficient to promptly pay when due the portion of the obligation falling due before the time of the following year's tax collection, subject to constitutional, statutory, and charter limitations. If the contract or an unlimited tax pledge in support of the contract has been approved by the electors of the local government, the tax may be in addition to any tax that the local government may otherwise be authorized to levy and may be imposed without limitation as to rate or amount, but shall not be in excess of the rate or amount necessary to pay the contractual obligation. If, at the time of making the annual tax levy, there are other funds on hand earmarked for the payment of the contractual obligation, credit for those funds may be taken upon the annual levy for the payment of the obligation. The contract is not subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The contract may provide for other funds to be raised and pledged by the local government by the use of 1 or more of the following additional methods:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The levy of special assessments to the extent legally permitted by the local government. The procedures relative to the levying and collection of the special assessments shall conform as nearly as is applicable to charter or statutory provisions for the levying and collection, except that a petition is not required from property owners.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The levy and collection of charges to users and beneficiaries of the service or services furnished by the lighting system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A pledge of revenue that would otherwise be received by the local government under the city utility users tax act, 1990 PA 100, MCL 141.1151 to 141.1177, as provided in subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The receipt of money derived from the imposition of taxes by this state, except to the extent that the use of the money for this purpose is expressly prohibited by the state constitution of 1963.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The receipt of other funds that may be validly used for this purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If an authority issues bonds pursuant to this section to be paid from revenues from a contract entered into pursuant to this section, the local government, in furtherance of its obligations under the contract, may by resolution or order pledge revenues to be received by the local government pursuant to the city utility users tax act, 1990 PA 100, MCL 141.1151 to 141.1177, to bonds of the authority issued pursuant to the contract. If the local government pledges these revenues, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Before the pledge and the contract become effective, the local government shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Enter into a trust agreement with the authority, the Michigan finance authority, and a trustee to provide for both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) Collection of pledged revenues by public utilities and resale customers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) Direct payment of those pledged revenues to the trustee for the purposes provided in this act. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Levy the tax.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Send a notice to each public utility and resale customer collecting the tax to remit those collections to the trustee designated in the trust agreement, pursuant to the city utility users tax act, 1990 PA 100, MCL 141.1151 to 141.1177.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Take all other steps necessary and convenient to arrange for and ensure the orderly collection of the taxes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) After the pledge and contract become effective, the local government shall continue to do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Levy the tax at not lower than the rate at which the tax is levied when the contract becomes effective. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Take all other steps necessary and convenient to ensure orderly collection of the taxes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Perform all of its other lawful obligations under the contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The pledged revenues collected or to be collected by public utilities and resale customers shall be held in trust to be applied for the sole and exclusive benefit of authority bondholders to the extent and in the manner provided for by this act, the contract, and the trust agreement, and may not be commingled with any other funds.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The pledged revenues are exempt from being levied upon, taken, sequestered, or applied toward paying the debts or liabilities of the local government other than for payment of debt service on the authority bonds and related administrative costs to which the contract and trust agreement apply. The pledged revenues shall be exempt from any further taxes or special assessments of this state or a political subdivision of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Although the pledged revenues are held in trust, to the extent that the local government or authority retains any interest in the pledged revenues, and solely to that extent, the pledged revenues shall be subject to a lien in favor of the authority bondholders. This lien is paramount and superior to all other liens and interests of any kind, including any interest of the local government or the authority, and shall be for the sole purpose of ensuring payment of the principal, interest, and related administrative costs of authority bonds secured by the contract and the trust agreement. The lien created is effected and perfected without delivery, recording, or notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A trust agreement may provide that, should the trustee determine that it holds funds in excess of those it reasonably considers necessary to make bond payments obligated under the contract and trust agreement, the trustee may release some or all of the excess funds from the trust and distribute them to the local government.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The local government may not enter into a contract pledging revenues pursuant to subsection (3) that would result in outstanding bonds secured by those pledged revenues having an aggregate annual debt service that exceeds $12,500,000.00 in any 1 year taking into account any anticipated federal credits as determined by the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Bonds" includes any ancillary facility or other financing instruments entered into by the authority if the facilities are permitted by the contract entered into between the local government and the authority. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Pledged revenues" means all money to be received by the local government pursuant to the city utility users tax act, 1990 PA 100, MCL 141.1151 to 141.1177, to the extent pledged for repayment of authority bonds under the contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Public utilities" and "resale customers" mean those terms as defined in the city utility users tax act, 1990 PA 100, MCL 141.1151 to 141.1177.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Calculate separately for each category of property the captured value of all industrial personal property and commercial personal property in the municipality that is a tax increment finance authority in 2013 and add any increased captured value for the current year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For the 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 calendar years' calculations, from each amount calculated in subdivision (a), subtract the captured value of all industrial personal property and commercial personal property in the municipality that is a tax increment finance authority in the current year for that category of property and multiply the resulting amount by each individual millage rate calculated under section 13(5), to the extent the millage is subject to capture by that tax increment finance authority for that category of property. For the calendar year 2021 and subsequent years' calculations, from each amount calculated in subdivision (a), subtract the captured value of all industrial personal property and commercial personal property in the municipality that is a tax increment finance authority in the current year for that category of property and multiply the resulting amount by each individual millage rate calculated under section 13(4) and (5) and the state education tax levied under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, to the extent the millage is subject to capture by that tax increment finance authority for that category of property.</div>

Funds appropriated under this subdivision for fiscal year 2015-2016 may be used to pay a corrected tax increment small taxpayer exemption loss for 2014 if a tax increment finance authority submits before June 1, 2016 a correction to a report that was filed under section 16a before October 1, 2014.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For fiscal years after 2013-2014, to the department, an amount equal to the necessary expenses incurred by the department in implementing this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Beginning in fiscal year 2019-2020 and each fiscal year thereafter, an amount sufficient to allow the authority to continue exercising its powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities under section 11(1)(b), including, for fiscal year 2019-2020, an amount sufficient for the creation of a database.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In fiscal year 2014-2015 and fiscal year 2015-2016, the authority shall distribute to municipalities those funds appropriated under subsection (1)(a). However, in fiscal year 2014-2015, if the authority is not able to make the distribution under this subsection, the department shall make the distribution under this subsection on behalf of the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For calendar years 2014 and 2015, the authority shall distribute local community stabilization share revenue to each city in an amount determined by multiplying the sum of the local community stabilization share revenue for the calendar years and the amounts calculated under section 14(3)(e) and (f) by a fraction, the numerator of which is that city's amount calculated under section 14(3)(d) and the denominator of which is the total amount calculated under section 14(3)(d), and subtracting from the result each city's amounts calculated under section 14(3)(e) and (f).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Beginning for calendar year 2016, after any distributions under subsection (10), the authority shall distribute local community stabilization share revenue as follows in the following order of priority:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The authority shall distribute to each municipality an amount equal to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) 100% of that municipality's school debt loss in the current year as calculated under section 13(4) and 100% of its amount calculated under section 15.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) 100% of the amount calculated in section 14(2). For calendar years 2016 and 2017 only, however, the amount distributed to a municipality under this subparagraph shall not exceed the amount calculated in section 14(1)(d). For all calendar years, all distributions under this subparagraph shall be used to fund essential services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) For a municipality that is a tax increment finance authority, 100% of its amount calculated under section 16a(2), as confirmed or adjusted by the department. For calculations made under section 16a(2), as modified by section 16b(2), in calendar years 2016 and 2017 only, amounts claimed for increased captured value shall be included as claimed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) 100% of that municipality's amount calculated under section 14(4).</div>

The department of licensing and regulatory affairs shall certify to the department and the authority the amount to be paid to each municipality under this subparagraph.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(viii) Beginning for calendar year 2019, for municipalities that incur certain reasonable and allowable costs of required and allowable health services described in section 2475 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.2475, $10,000,000.00 of those costs not otherwise reimbursed pursuant to section 2475 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.2475, or other appropriation. The department of health and human services shall certify to the department and the authority the amount to be paid to each municipality under this subparagraph.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Beginning for calendar year 2021, after the distributions under subdivision (a), and subject to subparagraph (viii), the authority shall distribute an amount equal to 10% of the total qualified loss for the current calendar year to each municipality that is not a local school district, intermediate school district, tax increment finance authority, or a local authority that first levied a millage rate after 2013 in an amount determined as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Calculate the total acquisition cost of all eligible personal property in the municipality.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Multiply the result of the calculation in subparagraph (i) by each individual millage levied by the municipality as calculated under section 13(5) that is not used to calculate a distribution under subdivision (a)(i) to (iv). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Divide the sum of the amounts calculated under subparagraph (ii) for all municipalities subject to the calculation by total qualified loss.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Multiply the result of the calculation in subparagraph (iii) by the difference between the amount calculated under section 16a(2) for captured taxes for each individual millage levied by the municipality not including taxes attributable to increased captured value and the subtraction amounts calculated under section 14(2)(d), (2)(f), and (4)(d) for that millage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Subtract from the amount calculated under subparagraph (ii) the amount calculated under subparagraph (iv) for the individual millage levied.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) Divide the result of the calculation in subparagraph (v) by the sum of the calculation under subparagraph (v) for all millages for all municipalities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vii) Multiply the result of the calculation in subparagraph (vi) by the amount to be distributed under this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(viii) For calendar year 2022, and each calendar year thereafter, the percentage amount described in this subdivision shall be increased an additional 10% each year, not to exceed 100%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For calendar years 2016 and 2017, after the distributions in subdivision (a), the authority shall distribute the remaining balance of the local community stabilization share fund for a calendar year to each municipality in an amount determined by multiplying the remaining balance by a fraction, the numerator of which is that municipality's qualified loss and the denominator of which is the total qualified loss. Beginning for calendar year 2018, after the distributions in subdivisions (a) and (b), the authority shall distribute local community stabilization share revenue under this subdivision to each municipality in an amount determined by multiplying total qualified loss minus the total amount distributed in subdivision (b) for a calendar year by a fraction, the numerator of which is that municipality's qualified loss and the denominator of which is the total qualified loss.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) After the distributions under subdivisions (a) to (c), beginning for calendar year 2018, the department shall adjust the amounts calculated under subdivisions (b) and (c) for a municipality that is a county, township, village, city, or community college district by the amount of any overpayment to that municipality under those subdivisions for that calendar year and the authority shall distribute the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) To a municipality, the amount of any underpayment calculated under subsection (5) for calendar years after 2016.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) For calendar year 2018 only, a total of $13,600,000.00 to municipalities with state facilities under 1977 PA 289, MCL 141.951 to 141.956. The department of licensing and regulatory affairs shall certify to the department the amount to be paid to each municipality under this subparagraph. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, after the distributions under subdivisions (a) to (d), the authority shall distribute the remaining balance of the local community stabilization share fund for the calendar year to each municipality that is a county, township, village, city, or community college district in an amount determined by multiplying the remaining balance by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of that municipality's amount received under subdivisions (b), (c), and (d), only to the extent that the distribution under subdivision (d) is for an underpayment of the current calendar year's subdivision (b) or (c) amount, and the overpayment adjustment under subdivision (d), and the denominator of which is the sum of the total amount distributed to all counties, townships, villages, cities, and community college districts under subdivisions (b), (c), and (d), only to the extent that the distribution under subdivision (d) is for an underpayment of the current calendar year's subdivision (b) or (c) amount, and the total overpayment adjustments for all counties, townships, villages, cities, and community college districts under subdivision (d). For any municipality that, in total, was overpaid under subdivisions (a), (b), and (c), the distribution under this subdivision, which for purposes of this calculation for any municipality other than a county, township, village, city, or community college district shall be $0, shall be reduced by any positive amount determined by subtracting the corrected amounts under subdivisions (a) to (c) for that municipality from the distributed amounts under subdivisions (a) to (c) for that municipality and subtracting $10,000.00. If the resulting distribution amount is negative, the municipality has been overpaid for the year by the amount of the negative balance. The municipality shall pay to the authority the amount of the overpayment in 3 equal annual payments, due by September 20 1 year following notice of the overpayment and by September 20 of the subsequent 2 years. A municipality may pay the amount of the overpayment at any time during the 3-year period. If a municipality fails to repay the amount of the overpayment as provided in this subdivision, the authority shall add interest to the entire amount of the original overpayment from the date of notice of the overpayment and may reduce subsequent distributions to the municipality under this section to recover the outstanding balance of the overpayment and interest. Interest added under this subdivision shall be at the rate determined under section 23 of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.23. Any overpayment amounts repaid to the authority under this subdivision by September 30 of each year shall be added to the local community stabilization share revenue available for distribution for the calendar year. If reductions to distributions calculated under this section result in the authority having a year-end balance of local community stabilization share revenue, that revenue shall be added to the local community stabilization share revenue available for distribution for the subsequent calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The department and authority shall administer overpayments and underpayments as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For calendar years before 2016, if a municipality received an overpayment under this section due to an error in reporting or calculation, the authority may reduce a subsequent payment to the municipality or bill the municipality to recover the overpayment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Before November 7, 2017, the department shall recalculate 2016 payments to correct any errors in reporting under section 13(3) or (4) and any calculation errors made by the department, and adjust the 2017 payment to each municipality for any change in its 2016 payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For calendar year 2018, for any errors in reporting under section 13(3) or (4) in calendar year 2017 or 2018, any calculation errors made by the department in calendar year 2017 or 2018, or any prior year error adjustment used in the calculation of the calendar year 2017 distributions, that resulted in an underpayment or overpayment under this section to a municipality for the prior calendar year or current calendar year, the department shall calculate the amount of underpayment or overpayment. For each municipality, the department shall add together the calendar year 2016 and calendar year 2017 underpayment and overpayment amounts. If a municipality has a net underpayment for calendar years 2016 and 2017, the amount of the net underpayment shall be added to the calendar year 2018 underpayment or overpayment amount for that municipality. If a municipality has a net overpayment for calendar years 2016 and 2017, the amount of the net overpayment shall be excused by the authority and shall not be added to the calendar year 2018 underpayment or overpayment amount for that municipality. The following apply to determining underpayment or overpayment amounts:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) For calendar year 2016, the underpayment or overpayment of a municipality's qualified loss shall be calculated by multiplying the municipality's qualified loss by 261.3820%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) For calendar year 2017, the underpayment or overpayment of a municipality's qualified loss shall be calculated by multiplying the municipality's qualified loss by 292.4677%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Beginning for calendar year 2019, for any errors in reporting under section 13(3) or (4), and for any calculation errors made by the department, that resulted in an underpayment or overpayment under this section to a municipality for the current calendar year, the department shall calculate the amount of underpayment or overpayment. A calculation made under this subdivision shall not recalculate a prior year payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Except as provided in subsection (6), any underpayment shall be paid to the municipality as provided in subsection (4)(d). Any underpayment amount determined by the department to be the fault of that municipality, by either the municipality reporting inaccurate information or filing information after the reporting due dates, shall not be included in any payment made under subsection (4)(d) or (6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) For any overpayment for which the state treasurer determines that the municipality was at fault and acted in bad faith, the department may calculate the amount of the overpayment for all years to which the bad faith applied without any adjustment and the municipality shall immediately repay the amount of the overpayment and interest to the authority within 30 days following notice of the overpayment. If a municipality fails to repay the amount of the overpayment and interest to the authority, the authority shall reduce subsequent payments to the municipality under this section to recover the outstanding balance of the overpayment and interest. Interest added under this subsection shall be at the rate determined under section 23 of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.23. Any overpayment amounts repaid to the authority under this subsection by September 30 of each year shall be added to the local community stabilization share revenue available for distribution for the calendar year. Any reduction of subsequent payments due to municipalities failing to repay the amount of the overpayment and interest shall be added to the local community stabilization share revenue available for distribution for the subsequent calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a municipality received an underpayment under this section of $500,000.00 or more for calendar year 2017 due to an error in reporting under section 13(3) or (4), or a calculation error made by the department, including a prior year error adjustment used in the calculation of the calendar year 2017 distributions, the municipality may notify the department of any errors identified by providing substantiating documentation to support an adjustment to the payment amount by August 1, 2018. Upon the department's review of the substantiating documentation and verification of the errors, the department shall calculate an underpayment amount in accordance with subsection (5)(c). The underpayment amount shall be calculated using the appropriate proration factor provided for under subsection (5)(c). The department shall determine if the substantiating documentation is sufficient. The department shall notify the authority to make an advance 2018 payment to the municipality for the amount of the 2017 underpayment. The advance payment shall be deducted from the municipality's payment for calendar year 2018 that includes the distribution under subsection (4)(d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For payments received beginning October 20, 2018, a municipality shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Allocate payments received, up to 100% reimbursement, under this section based on the portion of the municipality's payment attributable to each millage levied by the municipality. The portion of the payment allocated to each millage other than the general operating millage shall be considered restricted and recorded by the municipality in the same manner as the millage levied. As used in this subsection, "100% reimbursement" means the amounts received under subsection (4)(a)(i) to (vi), (b), (c), and (d)(i), only to the extent that the distribution under subsection (4)(d)(i) is for an underpayment of the current calendar year's subsection (4)(a)(i) to (vi), (b), or (c) amount.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For millage levied by a county under section 20b of 1909 PA 283, MCL 224.20b, the governing bodies of the cities and villages in the county and the board of county road commissioners shall agree to a formula that allocates a portion of the payments under this section to each city and village based on the city and village share of the losses and acquisition cost used to calculate the payment to the county described in this subdivision and each city's and village's portion of that share. The formula once established will be in effect until the effective date of any subsequent agreement. If the governing bodies of the cities and villages and the board of county road commissioners described in this subdivision do not agree on a formula by March 31 following the receipt of the subsection (8)(b) payment, the department may prescribe a formula for allocating the payments under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Payments under this section, except for the payments under subsection (4)(a)(vii) and (viii) and subsection (4)(d)(ii), to a municipality that is participating in an intergovernmental conditional transfer by contract under 1984 PA 425, MCL 124.21 to 124.30, or any other interlocal agreement that provides for a millage-based sharing of revenue, shall be allocated between the parties based on the proportionate share of the payment as it is attributable to the area subject to the agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The authority shall make the payments required by subsection (3) not later than June 20, 2016, payments required by subsection (6) not later than October 20, 2018, and payments required by subsection (4) not later than on the following dates:</div>
