<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Within 24 hours after receiving a report made or information obtained under section 11a, the county department shall commence an investigation to determine whether the person suspected of being or believed to be abused, neglected, or exploited is an adult in need of protective services. A reasonable belief on the part of the county department that the person is an adult in need of protective services is a sufficient basis for investigation. If an investigation pertains to an adult residing in an adult foster care facility licensed by the department of licensing and regulatory affairs, the county department shall provide the adult foster care licensee with the substance of the abuse or neglect allegations as soon as practicable after the beginning of the investigation. The licensee must have the opportunity to respond to the allegations, and the response must be included in the record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Upon a request by the county department, local law enforcement officers shall cooperate with the county department in an investigation of suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation. The investigation required by this section is not in place of an investigation by the appropriate police agency regarding suspected criminal conduct arising from the suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The investigation must include a determination of the nature, extent, and cause of the abuse, neglect, or exploitation; examination of evidence; identification, if possible, of the person responsible for the abuse, neglect, or exploitation; the names and conditions of other adults in the place of residence; an evaluation of the persons responsible for the care of the adult, if appropriate; the environment of the residence; the relationship of the adult to the person responsible for the adult's care; an evaluation as to whether or not the adult would consent to receiving protective services; and other pertinent data.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The investigation must include an in-person interview with the adult. The county department shall conduct the interview by means of a personal visit with the adult in the adult's dwelling or in the office of the county department. In attempting to conduct a personal visit with the adult in the adult's dwelling, if admission to the dwelling is denied, the county department may seek to obtain a search warrant as provided in 1966 PA 189, MCL 780.651 to 780.659.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The investigation may include a medical, psychological, social, vocational, and educational evaluation and review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) In the course of an investigation, the county department shall determine if the adult is or was abused, neglected, or exploited. The county department shall make available to the adult the appropriate and least restrictive protective services, directly or through the purchase of services from other agencies and professions, and shall take necessary action to safeguard and enhance the adult's welfare, if possible. The county department also shall collaborate with law enforcement officers, courts of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate state and community agencies providing human services, which services are provided in relation to preventing, identifying, and treating adult abuse, neglect, or exploitation. If the abuse, neglect, or exploitation involves substance use disorder, the county department shall collaborate with the local substance use disorder coordinating agency as designated by the office of recovery oriented systems of care in the department for a referral for substance use disorder services. The county department may petition for a finding of incapacity and to have a guardian or temporary guardian appointed as provided in section 5303 or 5312 of the estates and protected individuals code, 1998 PA 386, MCL 700.5303 and 700.5312, and may petition to have a conservator appointed as provided in section 5401 of the estates and protected individuals code, 1998 PA 386, MCL 700.5401, for a vulnerable adult. If a financial institution made the report of suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation, the county department may inform that financial institution of the status of the investigation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Upon completion of an investigation, the county department shall prepare a written report of the investigation and its findings. A copy of this written report shall be forwarded to the department upon request. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The county department may provide a copy of the written report to the prosecuting attorney for the county in which the adult suspected of being or believed to be abused, neglected, or exploited resides or is found.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A representative from the department, the department of state police, the department of attorney general, and the office of services to the aging, and an individual who is a representative of long-term care providers and is designated by the department of attorney general, shall meet and develop a state model protocol for investigating vulnerable adult abuse cases. A county prosecuting attorney, in cooperation with the local county department and local law enforcement agencies, may adopt a local protocol for investigating vulnerable adult abuse cases that is based on the state model protocol.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The state department has all of the following additional powers and duties:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   To allocate and distribute to the county and district departments of social services, as provided in section 18, and in accordance with the rules promulgated by the director, money appropriated by the legislature or received from the federal government for the relief of destitution or unemployment within the state, or a political subdivision of the state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   To distribute, as provided in this act, subject to federal rules and regulations, and in accordance with the rules promulgated by the director, money appropriated by the legislature or received from the federal government for the granting of aid to dependent children and supplemental security income; for medical, dental, optometric, nursing, pharmaceutical, and burial relief; for services furnished by professions under the public health code, Act No. 368 of the Public Acts of 1978, as amended, being sections 333.1101 to 333.25211 of the Michigan Compiled Laws; and for other relief or welfare services provided by law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   To operate a day care program in rural and urban areas and assist in the development of sound programs and standards for day care by public organizations throughout the state. If the director, commissioner, or those officials responsible for enforcing a state or local building code determine that a dwelling unit fails to meet the standards of that code through fault of the landlord, the department may refuse to pay public assistance grants authorized under this act for payment of rent on the dwelling unit. A written notice of the refusal, stating the grounds for the refusal and listing the defects to be corrected, shall be mailed immediately to the landlord by certified mail. During the period of refusal, the landlord may bring an action against the department in the nature of quo warranto, but may not maintain an action for the rent or possession of the premises. If the defects have been corrected or if the department's refusal to pay is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be wrongful, the department shall pay the rent that is owed, but not more than the amount of the grants withheld. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   To assist other departments, agencies, and institutions of the federal and state governments, when so requested, in performing services in conformity with the purposes of this act.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   To collect and compile statistics, make special fact-finding studies, and publish reports in reference to the field of welfare, including a biennial report as provided in section 17.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   To arbitrate and decide disputed or contested claims between 2 or more counties relative to the settlement or domicile of a person or family given or in need of any form of public aid or relief, and to determine and declare the county of settlement or domicile in any instance when so requested or on the department's own volition. All decisions and determinations made under this subdivision shall be binding upon the county departments of social services. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)   To administer or supervise relief or welfare functions vested in the department by law, and to provide for the progressive codification of the laws governing relief and welfare problems.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(k)   To inspect county infirmaries and places of detention for juveniles for the purpose of obtaining facts pertaining to the usefulness and proper management of the infirmaries and places of detention, and of promoting proper, efficient, and humane administration of those infirmaries and places of detention. A reasonable order of the department fixing minimum standards of sanitation, fire protection, food, and comfortable lodging may be enforced, through mandamus or injunction in the circuit court for the county where the county infirmary or place of detention for the juveniles is located, through proper proceedings instituted by the attorney general on behalf of the department. The burden of proof shall be on the department to establish the reasonableness of the order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(l)   To promulgate by rules a recommended schedule of payment for care and maintenance, pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, as amended, being sections 24.201 to 24.328 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, to be used, as provided by law, in determining the amount of payment to be made by patients, their guardians, or relatives who are liable for the care and maintenance of persons entitled to treatment under the mental health code, Act No. 258 of the Public Acts of 1974, as amended, being sections 330.1001 to 330.2106 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. The department in promulgating the schedule may give consideration to the person's income, the number of other persons he or she is obligated to support, his or her estate, medical and other necessary expenses, and other relevant matters.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(n)   To provide or contract for legal services for persons receiving assistance under this act in guardianship and support proceedings.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(p)   To provide services to adults and aging persons, which shall include:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Services for the blind in accordance with the rehabilitation act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 701 to 796i.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Services authorized in title XX of the social security act, 42 U.S.C. 1397 to 1397e.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(q)   To license and regulate child care organizations and programs as described in Act No. 116 of the Public Acts of 1973, as amended, being sections 722.111 to 722.128 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Other sections of this act notwithstanding, all powers and duties of the county social services boards to develop, implement, and administer a program of general public relief, are transferred to the state department effective beginning with the first county fiscal year following December 1, 1975.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As used in this section, "Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly" or "PACE" means an innovative model of community-based care that enables elderly individuals, who are certified as needing nursing facility care, to live as independently as possible.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A prospective PACE organization can be a not-for-profit, for-profit, or public entity that is primarily engaged in providing PACE services and participates in both Medicare and Medicaid. Michigan licensure as a health care entity is not required. An unlicensed PACE entity may serve any eligible enrollee. A prospective PACE entity must meet the federal requirements for a PACE organization, enroll as a Michigan Medicaid provider, and complete a feasibility study.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A prospective PACE organization must submit both of the following to the department:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Not later than 90 calendar days after submitting a letter of intent, a feasibility study.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Not later than 1 year after the department approves the feasibility study, a provider application.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) When submitting a letter of intent, a prospective PACE entity must state in the application the service area proposed for the PACE program. If the state determines that there is unmet need in a designated geographic area already covered by an existing PACE organization, the department must notify that PACE organization in a reasonable amount of time, and that PACE organization must be given the opportunity to submit a plan to expand capacity sufficient to accommodate need. The department must give the existing PACE program 6 months from notice of the determination of unmet need to submit an expansion plan. If the existing PACE organization fails to submit a reasonable plan for expansion within 6 months, the state may allow proposals from other PACE organizations. The department shall work with the PACE Association of Michigan and other appropriate provider representatives to develop an acceptable methodology to determine unmet need.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For purposes of the family independence program and medical assistance under this act, a resident of this state is a person who is living in this state voluntarily with the intention of making his or her home in this state and not for a temporary purpose and who is not receiving assistance from another state. For purposes of medical assistance, a resident of this state also includes a person and the dependents of a person who, at the time of application, is living in this state, is not receiving assistance from another state, and entered the state with a job commitment or seeking employment in this state.

This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit a person from acquiring or retaining a legal residence.</DIV>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>400.55 Administration of public welfare program by county department.</B><P>Sec. 55.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The county department shall administer a public welfare program, as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) To grant general assistance, including medical care and care in the county medical care facility, but not including hospitalization and infirmary care except for care in the county medical care facility or a county infirmary existing on January 1, 1981, to any person domiciled in the county who has a legal settlement in this state. General assistance may also be granted to a person who has a legal settlement in this state but no domicile in the county and a recoupment may be made when appropriate in the manner provided in cases of emergency hospitalization under this act. In a temporary emergency, general assistance may be given to indigents without a settlement in this state as the county department considers necessary, including, if other funds are not available for the purpose, all necessary expenses in transporting an indigent to his or her domicile in this state, or in another state or nation, when information reasonably tends to show that the person has a home available in his or her place of domicile in this state or a legal residence in another state or nation. A legal settlement in this state is acquired by an emancipated person who has lived continuously in this state for 1 year with the intent to make it his or her home and who, during the 1-year period has not received public assistance, other than assistance received during and as a direct result of a civil defense emergency, or support from relatives. Time spent in a public institution shall not be counted in determining settlement. A legal settlement shall be lost by remaining away from this state for an uninterrupted period of 1 year except that absence from this state for labor or other special or temporary purpose shall not occasion loss of settlement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) To administer categorical assistance including medical care.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) To supervise and be responsible for the operation of the county infirmary and county medical care facility. In a county having a population of 1,000,000 or more that maintains a county infirmary or county hospital or a joint infirmary and hospital providing for mental patients, the institution and the admissions to the institution are subject to the control of a board to be known as the board of county institutions. The board shall consist of 5 members appointed by the county board of commissioners, except that in a county having a board of county auditors, 3 members of the board of county institutions shall be appointed by the county board of commissioners and 2 members shall be appointed by the board of county auditors. Each member of the board shall hold office for a term and receive compensation as the county board of commissioners provides by ordinance. In relation to the administration of the institutions the board has and succeeds to all powers and duties formerly vested by law, general, local or special, in the superintendents of the poor in the county and the board of county institutions as constituted on April 13, 1943. The board of county institutions of the county may also maintain outpatient facilities for the treatment of needy persons suffering from mental disorders. The board also has the same powers as are given to the county board in section 78.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) To furnish in all cases, insofar as practicable, care and treatment that will tend to restore needy persons to a condition of financial and social independence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) To require that each applicant shall furnish proof satisfactory to the county board that the applicant is entitled to the aid, assistance, or benefit sought.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) To investigate, in respect to each application for any form of public aid or assistance, the circumstances of the applicant, both at the time of application and periodically during the receipt of aid or assistance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) To maintain adequate social and financial records pertaining to each recipient of aid or assistance and so far as is practicable engage in the prevention of social disabilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, to investigate, when requested by the probate court or the family division of circuit court, matters pertaining to dependent, neglected, and delinquent children and wayward minors under the court's jurisdiction, to provide supervision and foster care as provided by court order, and to furnish the court, on request, investigational service in respect to the hospitalization of children under the program of services for children and youth with special health care needs established under part 58 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.5801 to 333.5879, which services shall include the follow-up investigation and continuing observations. If the county is a county juvenile agency as defined in section 2 of the county juvenile agency act, 1998 PA 518, MCL 45.622, the county department's obligations under this subdivision are limited to public wards within the county's jurisdiction under the youth rehabilitation services act, 1974 PA 150, MCL 803.301 to 803.309, and county juvenile agency services as defined in section 117a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) To assist other departments, agencies, and institutions of the federal, state, and county governments, when requested, in performing services in conformity with the purposes of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) To assist in the development of sound programs and standards of child welfare, and promote programs and policies looking toward the prevention of dependency, neglect, and delinquency and other conditions affecting adversely the welfare of families and children.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) To create within the county department a division of medical care. The county board may appoint a properly qualified and licensed doctor of medicine as the head of the division and an advisory committee. The advisory committee shall consist of 1 doctor of medicine, nominated by the county medical society; 1 dentist, nominated by the district dental society; and 1 pharmacist, nominated by the district pharmaceutical association, to assist in formulating policies of medical care and auditing and reviewing bills. "Medical care" as used in this act means medical care rendered under the supervision of a licensed physician in an organized out-patient department of a hospital licensed by the department of community health under article 17 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.20101 to 333.22260, or home and office attendance by a physician, osteopathic physician and surgeon, or podiatrist licensed or otherwise authorized to engage in practice under article 15 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.16101 to 333.18838; and when prescribed by the physician, osteopathic physician and surgeon, or podiatrist, diagnostic services requiring the use of equipment not available in his or her offices, if the services do not require overnight care, dental service, optometric service, bedside nursing service in the home, or pharmaceutical service. The private physician-patient relationship shall be maintained. The normal relationships between the recipients of dental, optometric, nursing, and pharmaceutical services, and the services furnished by a physician, osteopathic physician and surgeon, podiatrist, or a chiropractor licensed or otherwise authorized to engage in practice under article 15 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.16101 to 333.18838, and the persons furnishing these services shall be maintained. This section does not affect the office of a city physician or city pharmacist established under a city charter, a county health officer, or the medical superintendent of a county hospital. This section permits the use of a case management system, a patient care management system, or other alternative system for providing medical care.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) To cause to be suitably buried the body of a deceased indigent person who has a domicile in the county, when requested by the person's relative or friend, or of a stranger, when requested by a public official following an inquest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) To administer additional welfare functions as are vested in the department, including hospitalization.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) To act as an agent for the state department in matters requested by the state department under the rules of the state department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(o) To provide temporary general assistance for each family found ineligible for family independence assistance by reason of unsuitable family home as provided in section 56.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In accordance with 42 USC 608(a)(7)(A) and 45 CFR 260.31, the department shall not provide family independence program assistance to any program group that includes an adult who has received assistance under any state program funded with temporary assistance for needy families for more than 60 months, whether or not consecutive, after October 1, 1996. This subsection does not apply to a program group that includes an adult who is exempt from participation in the PATH program under section 57f(3) or (4)(b), (e), or (f), if that adult also was exempt from participation in the former JET program under section 57f(3) or (4)(b), (e), or (f) on January 9, 2013.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A new parent or stepparent described in subsection (5) and his or her children shall not be included in determining an increase in the size of the recipient's program group. If the recipient wishes to increase the size of his or her program group as a result of marriage, he or she may choose to reject the income disregard described in subsection (5). If the recipient rejects the income disregard described in subsection (5), his or her new spouse and the spouse's children, as determined by the department under federal rules and regulations, may be included in determining the size of the recipient's program group.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The income disregard described in subsection (5) and section 57b(1)(b) only applies if the department receives approval from the federal government to implement this program.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An individual who meets all of the following requirements is eligible for family independence program assistance:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Is a member of a family or a family independence program assistance group.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Is a member of a program group whose income and assets are less than the income and asset limits set by the department. Except as provided in section 57a(6) and (7), when determining a program group's income and assets, the department shall disregard the income and assets of a new parent or new stepparent, who becomes a new program group member as the result of marriage, from 1 month after the date of the marriage until 18 months after that date unless the income and assets disregard results in a decrease of eligible assistance. The disregard of a new parent's or new stepparent's income and assets only applies if the program group's income and assets do not exceed twice the income and asset limits set by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) In the case of a minor parent, meets the requirements of subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Is a United States citizen, a permanent resident alien, or a refugee.

Child care in conjunction with participation in education, employment readiness, training, or employment programs, that have been approved by the department, shall be provided for the minor parent's child. The minor parent and child shall live with the minor parent's parent, stepparent, or legal guardian unless the department determines that there is good cause for not requiring the minor parent and child to live with a parent, stepparent, or legal guardian. The department shall determine the circumstances that constitute good cause, based on a parent's, stepparent's, or guardian's unavailability or unwillingness or based on a reasonable belief that there is physical, sexual, or substance abuse, or domestic violence, occurring in the household, or that there is other risk to the physical or emotional health or safety of the minor parent or child. If the department determines that there is good cause for not requiring a minor parent to live with a parent, stepparent, or legal guardian, the minor parent and child shall live in another adult-supervised household. A local office director may waive the requirement set forth in this subsection with respect to a minor parent who is at least 17 years of age, attending secondary school full-time, and participating in a department service plan or a teen parenting program, if moving would require the minor parent to change schools.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a recipient who is otherwise eligible for family independence program assistance under this section is currently applying for supplemental security income and seeking exemption from the PATH program, the recipient shall be evaluated and assessed as provided in this section before a family self-sufficiency plan is developed under section 57e.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A determination that the recipient is exempt from PATH program participation under section 57f and a referral for supplemental security income advocacy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The department may contract with a legal services organization to assist recipients with the process for applying for supplemental security income. The department may also contract with a nonprofit rehabilitation organization to perform the evaluation and assessment described under subsection (3). If the department contracts with either a nonprofit legal or rehabilitation services organization, uniform contracts shall be used statewide that include, but are not limited to, uniform rates and performance measures.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The auditor general shall conduct an annual audit of the evaluation and assessment process required under this section and submit a report of his or her findings to the legislature.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Except as provided in subsection (7) and beginning after the date on which the department implements the policy described in subsection (7), a family independence program assistance group shall not receive family independence program assistance if a member of the program group does not meet the attendance requirements of section 1561 of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1561, with respect to a child under the age of 16. Except as provided in subsection (7) and beginning after the date on which the department implements the policy described in subsection (7), if a member of the program group does not meet the attendance requirements of section 1561 of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1561, with respect to a child age 16 and above, the child shall be removed from the program group. The department shall implement policies in accordance with this subsection that are effective and binding on all program groups and are exempt from the rule promulgation requirements of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Not later than June 11, 2016, the department shall implement a policy that it must follow before terminating a family independence program assistance group from receiving family independence program assistance as provided in subsection (6) or before removing a child from the program group as provided in subsection (6). The department shall apply the policy described in this subsection before removing a family independence program assistance group from receiving family independence program assistance as described in subsection (6) and before removing a child from a family independence program assistance group as described in subsection (6).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Each family receiving family independence program assistance shall execute a family self-sufficiency plan outlining the responsibilities of members of the family independence program assistance group, the contractual nature of family independence program assistance, and the focus on the goal of attaining self-sufficiency.

The family self-sufficiency plan shall identify compliance goals that are to be met by members of the family independence program assistance group and goals and responsibilities of the members of the family independence program assistance group, the department, and the JET program. The family self-sufficiency plan shall reflect the individual needs and abilities of the particular family, and shall include at least all of the following:</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The state department in accordance with its rules and regulations may pay for medical care that a recipient of aid to the blind, aid to disabled, aid to dependent children, or old age assistance, receives in the county medical care facility. Other persons admitted to care in the facility shall be charged for the cost of their care to the extent of their financial ability as determined by the county department and such financial ability shall not preclude their eligibility for such care. Prior consideration shall be given to any person who comes within the definition of a "poor person" set forth in section 1 of chapter 1 of Act No. 146 of the Public Acts of 1925, as amended, being section 401.1 of the Compiled Laws of 1948.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Any county department which shall accept state financial aid for capital expenditures related to the establishment, extension or improvement of its facilities shall accept for care any patient eligible for admission as provided in section 58a, and having a domicile in the county and any patient for whom care is requested by the state department because of being found in the county without either a known domicile in the state or a place of residence outside the state to which he may be returned.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Direct state financial aid to meet part of the cost of capital expenditures for the establishment, extension or improvement of a county medical care facility may be provided from the general funds of the state or from such federal funds as may be made available in the following manner: The county social welfare board with the approval of the county board of supervisors will make an application to the state department as otherwise provided in section 58 but shall make in addition, a showing of need, in the same manner as provided in section 18, that it is unable to meet all of the capital expenses of a county medical care facility. The state department shall determine the percentage of the total capital cost of the facility which the county will be unable to meet and shall request from the legislature an appropriation from the general fund of the state or such federal funds as may be made available for this purpose to meet this amount. Requests of the legislature from the state department for such appropriations shall be separate items for each medical care facility. The amount of state aid actually granted the county by the state department shall not exceed (1) the amount appropriated by the legislature in respect to the amount of the item in the budget, or (2) the percentage of state aid required as previously determined by the state department, whichever is the lesser.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   To defray the cost of construction in the establishment or extension of the medical care facility, the board of supervisors may raise in any 1 year a sum not exceeding .1 mill of each dollar of assessed valuation of the county, such tax to be regarded as a special tax collected in the same manner as other county charges, and moneys received therefrom shall be transmitted to the treasurer of the county who shall deposit same in a special fund to be used solely for the purposes for which the tax is spread. Money expended for construction in the establishment or extension of the facility shall be paid out by the county treasurer on the order of the county social welfare board.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 63.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as provided in subsection (2), all aid, relief, or assistance given under this act is absolutely inalienable by any assignment, sale, garnishment, execution, or otherwise, and in the event of bankruptcy, shall not pass to or through any trustee or other person acting on behalf of creditors.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   To the extent allowed by law, if a judgment is entered against a recipient for damages arising from the recipient's breach of an oral or written lease agreement for rental housing and the judgment creditor submits a certified copy of the judgment to the department, the department shall deduct up to 10% of each cash grant for which the department determines the recipient is eligible and convey that amount to the judgment creditor until the judgment is satisfied. This subsection applies only to a lease agreement for property that has not been found to be in violation of an applicable housing code by a state or local agency authorized to enforce housing laws. This subsection does not create a cause of action against the department for damages caused by a recipient's breach of a lease agreement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a federal waiver is necessary to implement subsection (2), the department shall promptly seek the waiver. In the absence of a necessary waiver, the department shall apply this section only to recipients of assistance programs financed entirely by state or local revenues.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The judgment creditor shall pay a $1.00 processing fee to the department for each payment made under subsection (2). The department may deduct the processing fee from each payment made to the judgment creditor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The department shall include in its biennial report required under section 17 the number of cases and the dollar amounts deducted under subsection (2). The report shall include statewide totals and information broken down by county.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   As used in this section, "recipient" means an individual receiving direct cash assistance under this act.</DIV>

The department shall submit recommended procedures to the appropriate standing committees of the legislature for approval in order to allow other counties to adopt a patient care management system pursuant to this act. Such procedures shall be submitted by January 1, 1989. If a county's original application for certification of a patient care management system is approved under this section, the county shall apply to the state department in each subsequent year for recertification of its patient care management system according to the standards established under this subsection. The application for recertification shall be submitted not later than April 1 of each year, and shall be considered automatically approved by the state department unless denied by the state department, based upon the standards established under this section, within 30 days after being received by the state department.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Under a patient care management system, a county shall establish sufficient rates of reimbursement and appropriate length of stay for inpatient treatments for hospitals and other health care providers and shall contract with hospitals and other health care providers for medical care of persons determined to be eligible by the county. The county shall enter into sufficient contracts to assure that persons determined to be eligible by the county have access to hospital services, physician services, and other medical services considered appropriate by the county board of social services.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A county that establishes a patient care management system annually shall submit a report to the state department containing information on the number of patients served, the services rendered for those patients, the amount of funds spent for those services and the terms of the contracts entered into pursuant to subsection (3). The report shall be submitted not later than 90 days after the end of the county's fiscal year. A county's expenditures for the operation and administration of a patient care management system are subject to audit by the state.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 66n.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a patient care management system is established in a county in which the total payments to hospitals in the county for the county's resident county hospitalization program exceeded $10,000,000.00 during the county's full fiscal year immediately before the effective date of this section, the state shall appropriate for fiscal year 1988-89 the aggregate amount to the county which the state had appropriated under this act in fiscal year 1987-88 as separate amounts for programs of resident county hospitalization and medical care for general assistance recipients in the county. Funds appropriated to a county under this section shall only be used for a patient care management system as prescribed in sections 66j to 66n, and shall only be made available to the county if the county appropriates and expends for its residential county hospitalization program in the county's fiscal year 1988-89 not less than $15,500,000.00. The ratio of the state's appropriation of $19,500,000.00 to the county appropriation of $15,500,000.00 for the resident county hospitalization program of a county described in this subsection shall be maintained for subsequent fiscal year appropriations by the county, unless the state appropriation is less than $19,500,000.00 in a subsequent year, in which case the county appropriation may decrease in order to maintain the ratio from the base year of $19,500,000.00 state funds to $15,500,000.00 county funds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a patient care management system is established in any county other than a county described in subsection (1), the state shall appropriate to the county for the state fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the patient care management system is established the aggregate amount which the state had appropriated under this act in the preceding fiscal year as separate amounts for programs of resident county hospitalization and medical care for general assistance recipients in the county. Funds appropriated to a county under this section shall only be used for a patient care management system as prescribed in sections 66j to 66n. Not more than 3% of the funds appropriated to a county under this subsection, and not more than 3% of the county funds appropriated for those same purposes, shall be used for administration of the patient care management system.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   For fiscal years following the year in which an aggregate amount is appropriated as prescribed in either subsection (1) or (2), that part of the aggregate amount appropriated that is attributable to former state payments to that county for medical care for general assistance recipients shall be adjusted by any changes in the county's general assistance caseload during the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the appropriation is to be made.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the cost of medical care in a county under a patient care management system exceeds the amount appropriated to the county under this section in any fiscal year, the county shall be liable for the difference.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Not less than $5,000,000.00 of the funds appropriated under this section to a county described in subsection (1) shall be set aside annually by the county to meet the inpatient hospitalization expenses of persons who are not general assistance recipients as of the date they are admitted to the hospital. If less than the entire $5,000,000.00 is spent in any year for the care of those persons, the remainder may be used for other expenses of the patient care management system.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Any state or local appropriations for a patient care management system that are not expended in the year for which they were appropriated shall be placed by the county in a special fund to be used exclusively for the purposes of the patient care management system in subsequent years.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The state treasurer shall not release funds appropriated to a county for a patient care management system unless the county to which the appropriation is to be made certifies annually to the state administrative board that the county meets the requirements established by this act for a patient care management system, and the state administrative board concurs annually with that certification.</DIV>

Agreements for the reimbursement of the county department of social welfare for relief granted to persons or families in their own homes may be required in the cases of applicants whose need for relief is based in whole or in part on inability to obtain funds, moneys, moneys which may be received, income or assets unavailable at the time of application for or grant of relief: Provided, however, That earnings from wages or salaries not due or owing at the time of application for or grant of relief shall not be included in reimbursement agreements. Reimbursements for any form of hospital care provided at county expense shall be collected and paid over by the department of social welfare to the county treasurer for deposit to the fund from which such expenditure was made: Provided, That no county department of social welfare nor any other agency of county government shall collect or receive reimbursements for hospitalization or other treatment for tuberculosis, whether there is an agreement to reimburse the county or not, unless such reimbursement has been ordered by the state commissioner of health or is found acceptable by him as a voluntary reimbursement as provided in section 3a of Act No. 314 of the Public Acts of 1927, as added, being section 329.403a of the Compiled Laws of 1948, and no county department of social welfare shall collect or receive reimbursements for hospitalization or other treatment for any other communicable disease or diseases.

All such employees, and all collection records and files in the county on cases investigated by the department of social welfare prior to the effective date hereof, shall be transferred to and be under the supervision, control and jurisdiction of the board of social welfare in such county.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If a county has acknowledged liability or has reimbursed another county for the cost of any form of aid, relief or hospital care provided at county expense, the county so reimbursed shall credit or remit, as the case may be, to the paying county within 60 days, any additional collections thereon from any other source.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As used in this act, "medically indigent individual" means any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An individual receiving family independence program benefits or an individual receiving supplemental security income under title XVI or state supplementation under title XVI subject to limitations imposed by the director according to title XIX.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Except as provided in sections 106a and 106b, an individual who meets all of the following conditions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The individual has applied in the manner the department prescribes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The individual's need for the type of medical assistance available under this act for which the individual applied has been professionally established and payment for it is not available through the legal obligation of a public or private contractor to pay or provide for the care without regard to the income or resources of the patient. The department is subrogated to any right of recovery that a patient may have for the cost of hospitalization, pharmaceutical services, physician services, nursing services, and other medical services not to exceed the amount of money expended by the department for the care and treatment of the patient. The patient or other person acting on the patient's behalf shall execute and deliver an assignment of claim or other authorizations as necessary to secure the right of recovery to the department. A payment may be withheld under this act for medical assistance for an injury or disability for which the individual is entitled to medical care or reimbursement for the cost of medical care under chapter 31 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.3101 to 500.3179, or under another policy of insurance providing medical or hospital benefits, or both, for the individual unless the individual's entitlement to that medical care or reimbursement is at issue. If a payment is made, the department, to enforce its subrogation right, may do either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) intervene or join in an action or proceeding brought by the injured, diseased, or disabled individual, the individual's guardian, personal representative, estate, dependents, or survivors, against the third person who may be liable for the injury, disease, or disability, or against contractors, public or private, who may be liable to pay or provide medical care and services rendered to an injured, diseased, or disabled individual;</div>

The department may institute the proceedings in its own name or in the name of the injured, diseased, or disabled individual, the individual's guardian, personal representative, estate, dependents, or survivors.

The injured, diseased, or disabled individual may proceed in the injured, diseased, or disabled individual's own name, collecting the costs without the necessity of joining the department or the state as a named party. The injured, diseased, or disabled individual shall notify the department of the action or proceeding entered into upon commencement of the action or proceeding. An action taken by the state or the department in connection with the right of recovery afforded by this section does not deny the injured, diseased, or disabled individual any part of the recovery beyond the costs expended on the individual's behalf by the department. The costs of legal action initiated by the state must be paid by the state. A payment must not be made under this act for medical assistance for an injury, disease, or disability for which the individual is entitled to medical care or the cost of medical care under the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.101 to 418.941; except that payment may be made if an appropriate application for medical care or the cost of the medical care has been made under the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.101 to 418.941, entitlement has not been finally determined, and an arrangement satisfactory to the department has been made for reimbursement if the claim under the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.101 to 418.941, is finally sustained.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The individual has an annual income that is below, or subject to limitations imposed by the director and because of medical expenses falls below, the protected basic maintenance level. The protected basic maintenance level for 1-person and 2-person families must be not less than 100% of the payment standards generally used to determine eligibility in the family independence program. For families of 3 or more persons, the protected basic maintenance level must be not less than 100% of the payment standard generally used to determine eligibility in the family independence program. These levels must recognize regional variations and must not exceed 133-1/3% of the payment standard generally used to determine eligibility in the family independence program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The individual, if a family independence program related individual and living alone, has liquid or marketable assets of not more than $2,000.00 in value, or, if a 2-person family, the family has liquid or marketable assets of not more than $3,000.00 in value.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The individual, the individual's representative, or the individual's legal counsel, or all 3, seek to settle an action, without filing a complaint, in which the department or the contracted health plan may have a right to recover expenses paid under this act.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The notice required under subsection (3)(b) must be provided in writing to the department and, if applicable, the contracted health plan before the action is settled and must include the proposed settlement terms, including the settlement amount, attorney costs, attorney fees, and Medicaid health plan or Medicare subrogation interest amounts, if applicable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If notice is not given as required by subsections (3) to (5), the department or the contracted health plan may file a legal action against the individual, the individual's representative, or the individual's legal counsel, or all 3, to recover expenses paid under this act. The attorney general or the contracted health plan shall recover any cost or attorney fees associated with a recovery under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An attorney who knowingly fails to timely notify the department or the contracted health plan as required by this section is subject, at the discretion of the department, to a $1,000.00 civil fine for each violation.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The department has first priority against the proceeds of the net recovery from the settlement or judgment in an action settled in which notice has been provided under subsection (3). A contracted health plan has priority immediately after the department in an action settled in which notice has been provided under subsection (3). The department and a contracted health plan shall recover the full cost of expenses paid under this act unless the department or the contracted health plan agrees to accept an amount less than the full amount. If the individual would recover less against the proceeds of the net recovery than the expenses paid under this act, the department or the contracted health plan, and the individual shall share equally in the proceeds of the net recovery. The department or a contracted health plan is not required to pay an attorney fee on the net recovery.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Within 30 days of receiving the notice required under this act, the department and, if applicable, a contracted health plan shall provide to the individual, the individual's representative, or the individual's legal counsel, a written itemization of expenses paid under this act for which the third party may be liable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the department or a contracted health plan fails to provide the notice required by subdivision (a), the obligation of the individual, the individual's representative, or the individual's legal counsel, or all 3, to protect the subrogation interest of the department or the contracted health plan, or both if both failed to provide notice, is discharged. The department or the contracted health plan retains the right to pursue recovery through its own means.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A reported subrogation amount is valid unless supplemented by the department or a contracted health plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) An individual, the individual's representative, or the individual's legal counsel, or all 3, satisfy the obligation to protect the subrogation interest of the department or a contracted health plan if a settlement agreement provides for reimbursement of the total amount of expenses in the last received written itemization from the department or the contracted health plan, reduced by any applicable fees and costs for which a reduction is allowed under statute or administrative rule.</div>

The recipient may use a noncompliance month either by self-reporting that he or she is not in compliance that month or by the default method of not reporting compliance for that month. The department shall notify the recipient after each time a noncompliance month is used. After a recipient uses 3 noncompliance months in a 12-month period, the recipient loses coverage for at least 1 month until he or she becomes compliant under this section.</div>

A physician must be paid a reasonable charge for the service rendered. The department must determine reasonable charges. Reasonable charges must not be more than those paid in this state for services rendered under title XVIII.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An eligible individual may receive nursing home services in a state licensed nursing home, a medical care facility, or other facility or identifiable unit of that facility, certified by the appropriate authority as meeting established standards for a nursing home under the laws and rules of this state and the United States Department of Health and Human Services, to the extent found necessary by the attending physician, dentist, or certified Christian Science practitioner. An eligible individual may receive nursing services in an extended care services program established under section 22210 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.22210, to the extent found necessary by the attending physician when the combined length of stay in the acute care bed and short-term nursing care bed exceeds the average length of stay for Medicaid hospital diagnostic related group reimbursement.

The department must pay for nursing home services according to the state plan for medical assistance adopted according to section 10 and approved by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. A county must reimburse a county maintenance of effort rate determined on an annual basis for each patient day of Medicaid nursing home services provided to eligible individuals in long-term care facilities owned by the county and licensed to provide nursing home services. For purposes of determining rates and costs described in this subdivision, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) For county-owned facilities with per patient day updated variable costs exceeding the variable cost limit for the county facility, county maintenance of effort rate means 45% of the difference between per patient day updated variable cost and the concomitant nursing home-class variable cost limit, the quantity offset by the difference between per patient day updated variable cost and the concomitant variable cost limit for the county facility. The county rate must not be less than zero.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) For county-owned facilities with per patient day updated variable costs not exceeding the variable cost limit for the county facility, county maintenance of effort rate means 45% of the difference between per patient day updated variable cost and the concomitant nursing home class variable cost limit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) For county-owned facilities with per patient day updated variable costs not exceeding the concomitant nursing home class variable cost limit, the county maintenance of effort rate must equal zero.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) For the purposes of this section: "per patient day updated variable costs and the variable cost limit for the county facility" must be determined according to the state plan for medical assistance; for freestanding county facilities the "nursing home class variable cost limit" must be determined according to the state plan for medical assistance and for hospital attached county facilities the "nursing class variable cost limit" must be determined according to the state plan for medical assistance plus $5.00 per patient day; and "freestanding" and "hospital attached" must be determined according to the federal regulations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) If the county maintenance of effort rate computed under this section exceeds the county maintenance of effort rate in effect as of September 30, 1984, the rate in effect as of September 30, 1984 must remain in effect until a time that the rate computed under this section is less than the September 30, 1984 rate. This limitation remains in effect until December 31, 2025 or until a new reimbursement system determined by the department replaces the current system, whichever is sooner. For each subsequent county fiscal year, the maintenance of effort rate may not increase by more than $1.00 per patient day each year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) For county-owned facilities, reimbursement for plant costs must continue to be based on interest expense and depreciation allowance unless otherwise provided by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) An eligible individual may receive pharmaceutical services from a licensed pharmacist of the individual's choice as prescribed by a licensed physician or dentist and approved by the department. In an emergency, but not routinely, the individual may receive pharmaceutical services rendered personally by a licensed physician or dentist on the same basis as approved for pharmacists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) An eligible individual may receive other medical and health services as authorized by the department. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Psychiatric care may also be provided according to the guidelines established by the department to the extent of appropriations made available by the legislature for the fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) An eligible individual may receive screening, laboratory services, diagnostic services, early intervention services, and treatment for chronic kidney disease under guidelines established by the department. A clinical laboratory performing a creatinine test on an eligible individual under this subdivision must include in the lab report the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of the individual and must report it as a percentage of kidney function remaining.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) An eligible individual may receive medically necessary acute medical detoxification for opioid use disorder, medically necessary inpatient care at an approved facility, or care in an appropriately licensed substance use disorder residential treatment facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The director must provide notice to the public, according to applicable federal regulations, and must obtain the approval of the committees on appropriations of the house of representatives and senate of the state legislature, of a proposed change in the statewide method or level of reimbursement for a service, if the proposed change is expected to increase or decrease payments for that service by 1% or more during the 12 months after the effective date of the change.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) As used in this act:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Title XVIII" means title XVIII of the social security act, 42 USC 1395 to 1395lll.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, an abortion shall not be a service provided with public funds to a recipient of welfare benefits, whether through a program of medical assistance, general assistance, or categorical assistance or through any other type of public aid or assistance program, unless the abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother. It is the policy of this state to prohibit the appropriation of public funds for the purpose of providing an abortion to a person who receives welfare benefits unless the abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother.</div>

<font size="2">
  <p><BR><B>History:</B> Add. 1987, Act 59, Eff. Dec. 12, 1988 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> The Michigan Supreme Court considered an argument by plaintiffs in Doe v Department of Social Services, 439 Mich 650 (1992), that the state's refusal to pay for a therapeutic abortion violates the equal protection guarantee of the Michigan Constitution. Plaintiffs argued that S 400.109a provides unequal treatment to two classes of indigent, pregnant women — those who choose childbirth and those who chose abortion. The trial court in the case granted defendant's motion for summary disposition and dismissed the suit. The court of appeals reversed, 187 Mich App 493 (1991), concluding that (1) the equal protection guarantee in the Michigan Constitution provided greater protection than the corresponding guarantee in the federal constitution and (2) that the statute directly interferes with the women's right to an abortion. The Michigan Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals, holding that (1) there is no evidence of an intent in the Michigan Constitution to provide broader protection than its federal counterpart and (2) the state's decision to fund childbirth, but not abortion, does not impinge upon the exercise of a fundamental right. The Michigan Supreme Court, in upholding the validity of the statute under rational basis test, concluded that Michigan's Constitution permits the state to fund childbirth expenses even though it does not fund abortions.<BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> This added section was proposed by initiative petition pursuant to Const 1963, art 2, § 9. On June 17, 1987, the initiative petition was approved by an affirmative vote of the majority of the Senators elect and filed with the Secretary of State. On June 23, 1987, the initiative petition was approved by an affirmative vote of the majority of the Members elect of the House of Representatives and filed with the Secretary of State. The Legislature did not vote pursuant to Const 1963, art 4, § 27, to give immediate effect to this enactment.In Frey v Director, Department of Social Services, 162 Mich App 586; 413 NW2d 54 (1987), the Michigan Court of Appeals held that Const 1963, art 4, § 27, applies to initiative laws and that without the required two-thirds vote of each house of the Legislature, as provided by Const 1963, art 4, § 27, Act 59 of 1987 could not take effect until the expiration of 90 days from the end of the session at which it was passed.In affirming the decision of the Court of Appeals in Frey, the Michigan Supreme Court held that when a law is proposed by initiative and enacted by the Legislature without change or amendment within forty days as required by Const 1963, art 2, § 9, it takes effect ninety days after the end of the session in which it was passed unless two-thirds of the members of each house of the Legislature, as provided by art 4, § 27, vote to give the law immediate effect. Act 59 of 1987, not having received votes in favor of immediate effect by two-thirds of the elected members of each house, may not take effect until ninety days after the end of the session in which it was enacted. Frey v Director, Department of Social Services, 429 Mich 315; 414 NW2d 873 (1987).On March 1, 1988, petitions to invoke the power of referendum with regard to Act 59 of 1987 were filed with the Secretary of State. On April 13, 1988, the Board of State Canvassers certified the validity of a sufficient number of petition signatures to invoke the referendum. In a letter opinion to C. Patrick Babcock, Director, Department of Social Services, dated March 28, 1988, the Attorney General addressed the following question: “[I]f the filing of petitions, which include, if they are valid, a sufficient number of signatures to properly invoke a referendum, stays the effective date of Act 59 of 1987, which will otherwise become effective on March 30, 1988?” The Attorney General concluded that “when a petition seeking referendum, which on its face meets legal requirements, is filed the signatures appearing on that petition are presumed valid and the statute at issue is stayed or suspended until either the petitions are found to be invalid or a vote of the people occurs.”Act 59 of 1987, as enacted by the Legislature, was submitted to the people by referendum petition and approved by a majority of the votes cast at the general election held November 8, 1988. The Board of State Canvassers officially declared the vote to be 1,959,727 (for) and 1,486,371 (against) on December 2, 1988.<BR><B>Popular Name:</B> Act 280</p>

</P>
<P>Sec. 109d.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The legislature finds that the use of medicaid funds for elective abortions has been clearly rejected by the people of Michigan through Act No. 59 of the Public Acts of 1987, initiated by the citizens under the rights of the people reserved in the Michigan constitution, approved by a majority of this legislature, affirmed by the citizens at large through a statewide referendum, and sustained by the Michigan supreme court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In light of evidence that abortion providers, in conjunction with third party payors, may have devised and implemented plans for reimbursing services in violation of the intent of Act No. 59 of the Public Acts of 1987, the legislature finds the enactment of section 109e a necessary clarification of, and enforcement mechanism for, Act No. 59 of the Public Acts of 1987.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The legislature finds that any practice of separating or unbundling services directly related to the performance of an abortion for the purposes of seeking medicaid reimbursement, with those funds thereby subsidizing in whole or in part the cost of performing an abortion, is an inappropriate use of taxpayer funds in light of Act No. 59 of the Public Acts of 1987.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Recognizing that certain services related to performing an abortion can also be part of legitimate and routine obstetric care, section 109e should not be construed to affect diagnostic testing or other nonabortion procedures. Only physicians who actually perform abortions, and particularly those who perform abortions but do not provide prenatal care or obstetric services, should view themselves as potentially affected by section 109e. Unacceptable requests for reimbursement include those services which would not have been performed, but for the preparation and performance of a planned or requested abortion.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Health care professional" means an individual licensed or registered under article 15 of the public health code, Act No. 368 of the Public Acts of 1978, being sections 333.16101 to 333.18838 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   "Health facility or agency" means a health facility or agency licensed under article 17 of Act No. 368 of the Public Acts of 1978, being sections 333.20101 to 333.22260 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A health care professional or a health facility or agency shall not seek or accept reimbursement for the performance of an abortion knowing that public funds will be or have been used in whole or in part for the reimbursement in violation of section 109a of Act No. 280 of the Public Acts of 1939, being section 400.109a of the Michigan Compiled Laws, as added by Act No. 59 of the Public Acts of 1987.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A person who violates this section is liable for a civil fine of up to $10,000.00 per violation. The department of community health shall investigate an alleged violation of this section and the attorney general, in cooperation with the department of community health, may bring an action to enforce this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Nothing in this section restricts the right of a health care professional to discuss abortion or abortion services with a patient who is pregnant.</DIV>

If in these procedures the director of the department of community health is required to consult with professionals or experts before first utilizing these individuals in the program, the director of the department of community health shall have given the opportunity to review their professional credentials to the appropriate medicaid peer review advisory committee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Except as otherwise provided in section 111i, develop with the appropriate consultation required by this section and require the form or format for claims, applications, certifications, or certifications and recertifications of medical necessity required by section 108, and develop specifications for and require supporting documentation that is compatible with the approved state medical assistance plan under title XIX.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Recover payments to a provider in excess of the reimbursement to which the provider is entitled. The department of community health shall have a priority lien on any assets of a provider for any overpayment, as a consequence of fraud or abuse, that is not reimbursed to the department of community health.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this act, before payment of claims, identify for examination for compliance with the program of medical assistance, including but not limited to medical necessity, the claims submitted by a particular provider based upon a determination that the provider's claims for disputed services exceed the average program dollar amount or volume of the same type of services, submitted by the same type of provider, performed in the same setting, and submitted during the same period. In order to carry out the authority conferred by this subdivision, the director of the department of community health shall notify the provider in the form of registered mail, receipted by the addressee, or by proof of service to the provider, or representative of the provider, of the state department of community health's intent to impose specific conditions and controls before authorizing payment for specific claims for services. The notice shall contain all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A list of the particular practice or practices disputed by the state department of community health and a factual description of the nature of the dispute.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A request for specific medical records and any other relevant supporting information that fully discloses the basis and extent to which the disputed practice or practices were rendered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) A date certain for an informal conference between the provider or representative of the provider and the state department of community health to resolve the differences surrounding the disputed practice or practices.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) A statement that unless the provider or representative of the provider demonstrates at the informal conference that the disputed practice or practices are medically necessary, or are in compliance with other program coverages, specific conditions and controls may be imposed on future payments for the disputed practice or practices, and claims may be rejected, beginning on the sixteenth day after delivery of this notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) For any provider who is subject to a notice of intent to impose specific conditions and controls before authorizing payment for specific claims for services, as specified in subsection (7)(e), the state department of community health shall afford that provider an opportunity for an informal conference before the sixteenth day after delivery of the notice under subsection (7)(e). If the provider fails to appear at the conference, or fails to demonstrate that the disputed practice or practices are medically necessary or are in compliance with program coverages, the state department of community health beginning on the sixteenth day following receipt of notice by the provider, is authorized to impose specific conditions and controls before payment for the disputed practice or practices and may reject claims for payments for the practice or practices. The state department of community health, within 5 days following the informal conference, shall notify the provider of its decision regarding the imposition of special conditions and controls before payment for the disputed practice or practices. Upon the imposition of specific conditions and controls before payment, the provider upon request shall be entitled to an immediate hearing held in conformity with chapter 4 and chapter 6 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287 and 24.301 to 24.306, if any of the following occurs:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The claim for services rendered is not paid within 30 days of the provider's compliance with the conditions imposed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The claim is rejected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The provider notifies the state department of community health by registered mail that the provider does not intend to comply with the specific conditions and controls imposed, and the claim for services rendered is not paid within 30 days after delivery of this notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The hearing provided for under subsection (8) shall be conducted in a prompt and expeditious manner. At the hearing, the provider may contest the state department of community health's decision to impose specific conditions and controls before payment. Subsequent hearings may be conducted at the provider's request only if the claims have not been considered at a prior hearing and reflect issues that also have not been considered at a prior hearing, or if a claim for services rendered is not paid within 60 days after the provider's compliance with the conditions imposed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The authority conferred in subsection (8) with respect to the claims submitted by a particular provider does not prohibit the state department of community health from examining claims or portions of claims before payment of the claims to determine their compliance with the program of medical assistance, in compliance with law. The director of the department of community health may take additional action under subsection (8) during the pendency of an appeal taken under subsection (8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If in the department of community health's opinion, the provider shifts his or her claims from the disputed services addressed under subsection (7)(e) to other claims that fall under the purview of subsection (7)(e), the director of the department of community health may impose the claims review process of this section immediately upon delivery of the notice of that imposition to the provider as provided in subsection (7)(e).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If in the department of community health's opinion, claims similar to the disputed services addressed under subsection (7)(e) are shifted to another provider in the same corporation, partnership, clinic, provider group, or to another provider in the employ of the same employer or contractor, the director of the department of community health may impose the claims review process of this section immediately upon delivery of notice of that imposition to the new provider as provided in subsection (7)(e). The department of community health shall afford the new provider an opportunity for an immediate informal conference within 7 days under subsection (8) after the initiation of the claims process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The director of the department of community health may request a provider to open books and records in accordance with section 111b(7) and may photocopy, at the state department of community health's expense, the records of a medically indigent individual. The records shall be confidential, and the state department shall use the records only for purposes directly and specifically related to the administration of the program. The immunity from liability of a provider subject to the director of the department of community health's authority under this subsection is governed by section 111b(7).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) The director of the department of community health shall not pay for services, supplies, or equipment furnished by a provider, or shall recover for payment made, during a period in which the provider does not have on file with the state department of community health disclosure forms as required by section 111b(19).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) The director of the department of community health shall make payments to, and collect overpayments from, the provider, unless the provider and the provider's employer satisfy the conditions prescribed in section 111b(25), (26), and (27), in which case the director of the department of community health may make payments directly to, and collect overpayments from, the provider's employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) The director of the department of community health, with the appropriate consultation required by this section, may develop specifications for and require estimated cost and charge information to be submitted by a provider under section 111b(13) and the form or format for submission of the information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) If the director of the department of community health decides that a payment under the program has been made to which a provider is not or may not be entitled, or that the amount of a payment is or may be greater or less than the amount to which the provider is entitled, the director of the department of community health, except as otherwise provided in this subsection or under other applicable law or regulation, shall promptly notify the provider of this decision. The director of the department of community health shall withhold notification to the provider of the decision upon advice from the department of attorney general or other state or federal enforcement agency in a case where action by the department of attorney general or other state or federal enforcement agency may be compromised by the notification. If the director of the department of community health notifies a provider of a decision that the provider has received an underpayment, the state department of community health shall reimburse the provider, either directly or through an adjustment of payments, in the amount found to be due.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>400.111b Requirements as condition of participation by provider.</B><P>Sec. 111b.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As a condition of participation, a provider shall meet all of the requirements specified in this section except as provided in subsections (25), (26), and (27).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A provider shall comply with all licensing and registration laws of this state applicable to the provider's practice or business. For a facility that is periodically inspected by a licensing authority, maintenance of licensure constitutes compliance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A provider shall be certified, if the provider is of the type for which certification is required by title XVIII or XIX.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A provider shall enter into an agreement of enrollment specified by the director.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A provider who renders a reimbursable service described in section 109 to a medically indigent individual shall provide the individual with service of the same scope and quality as would be provided to the general public.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A provider shall maintain records necessary to document fully the extent and cost of services, supplies, or equipment provided to a medically indigent individual and to substantiate each claim and, in accordance with professionally accepted standards, the medical necessity, appropriateness, and quality of service rendered for which a claim is made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Upon request and at a reasonable time and place, a provider shall make available any record required to be maintained by subsection (6) for examination and photocopying by authorized agents of the director, the department of attorney general, or federal authorities whose duties and functions are related to state programs of medical assistance under title XIX. If a provider releases records in response to a request by the director made under section 111a(13) or in compliance with this subsection, that provider is not civilly liable in damages to a patient or to another provider to whom, respectively, the records relate solely, on account of the response or compliance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A provider shall retain each record required to be maintained by subsection (6) for a period of 7 years after the date of service. A provider who no longer personally retains the records due to death, retirement, change in ownership, or other reason, shall ensure that a suitable person retains the records and provides access to the records as required in subsection (7).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A provider shall require, as a condition of a contract with a person, sole proprietorship, clinic, group, partnership, corporation, association, or other entity, for the purpose of generating billings in the name of the provider or on behalf of the provider to the department, that the person, partnership, corporation, or other entity, its representative, successor, or assignee, retain for not less than 7 years, copies of all documents used in the generation of billings, including the certifications required by subsection (17), and, if applicable, computer billing tapes if returned by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A provider shall submit all claims for services rendered under the program on a form or in a format and with the supporting documentation specified and required by the director under section 111a(7)(c) and by the commissioner of insurance under section 111i. Submission of a claim or claims for services rendered under the program does not establish in the provider a right to receive payment from the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A provider shall submit initial claims for services rendered within 12 months after the date of service, or within a shorter period that the director may establish or that the commissioner of insurance may establish under section 111i. The director shall not delegate the authority to establish a time period for submission of claims under this subsection. Except as otherwise provided in section 111i, the director, with the consultation required by section 111a, may prescribe the conditions under which a provider may qualify for a waiver of the time period established under this subsection with respect to a particular submission of a claim. Neither this state nor the medically indigent individual is liable for payment of claims submitted after the period established under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A provider shall not charge the state more for a service rendered to a medically indigent individual than the provider's customary charge to the general public or another third party payer for the same or similar service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) A provider shall submit information on estimated costs and charges on a form or in a format and at times that the director may specify and require according to section 111a(16).</div>

A provider shall not seek payment from the medically indigent individual, the family, or representative of the individual for either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Authorized services provided and reimbursed under the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Services determined to be medically unnecessary in accordance with professionally accepted standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) A provider may seek payment from a medically indigent individual for services not covered nor reimbursed by the program if the individual elected to receive the services with the knowledge that the services would not be covered nor reimbursed under the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) A provider promptly shall notify the director of a payment received by the provider to which the provider is not entitled or that exceeds the amount to which the provider is entitled. If the provider makes or should have made notification under this subsection or receives notification of overpayment under section 111a(17), the provider shall repay, return, restore, or reimburse, either directly or through adjustment of payments, the overpayment in the manner required by the director. Failure to repay, return, restore, or reimburse the overpayment or a consistent pattern of failure to notify the director shall constitute a conversion of the money by the provider.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) As a condition of payment for services rendered to a medically indigent individual, a provider shall certify that a claim for payment is true, accurate, prepared with the knowledge and consent of the provider, and does not contain untrue, misleading, or deceptive information. A provider is responsible for the ongoing supervision of an agent, officer, or employee who prepares or submits the provider's claims. A provider's certification required under this subsection shall be prima facie evidence that the provider knows that the claim or claims are true, accurate, prepared with his or her knowledge and consent, do not contain misleading or deceptive information, and are filed in compliance with the policies, procedures, and instructions, and on the forms established or developed under this act. Certification shall be made in the following manner:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For an invoice or other form submitted in claim for payment for the provision of services submitted indirectly by the provider to the department through a person, sole proprietorship, clinic, group, partnership, corporation, association, or other entity that generates and files claims on a provider's behalf, by the indelible written name of the provider on a certification form developed by the director for submission to the department with each group of invoices or forms in claim for payment. The certification form shall indicate the name of the person, if other than the provider, who signed the provider's name.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For a warrant issued in payment of a claim submitted by a provider, by the handwritten indelible signature of the payee, if the payee is a natural person; by the handwritten indelible signature of an officer, if the payee is a corporation; or by handwritten indelible signature of a partner, if the payee is a partnership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) A provider shall comply with all requirements established under section 111a(1), (2), and (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) A provider shall file with the department, on disclosure forms provided by the director, a complete and truthful statement of all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The identity of each individual having, directly or indirectly, an ownership or beneficial interest in a partnership, corporation, organization, or other legal entity, except a company registered according to the securities exchange act of 1934, 15 USC 78a to 78nn, through which the provider engages in practice or does business related to claims or charges against the program. This subdivision does not apply to a health facility or agency that is required to comply with and has complied with the disclosure requirements of section 20142(3) of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.20142. With respect to a company registered under the securities exchange act of 1934, 15 USC 78a to 78nn, a provider shall disclose the identity of each individual having, directly or indirectly, separately or in combination, a 5% or greater ownership or beneficial interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The identity of each partnership, corporation, organization, legal entity, or other affiliate whose practice or business is related to a claim or charge against the program in which the provider has, directly or indirectly, an ownership or beneficial interest, trust agreement, or a general or perfected security interest. This subdivision does not apply to a health facility or agency that is required to comply with and has complied with the disclosure requirements of section 20142(4) of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.20142.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If applicable to the provider, a copy of a disclosure form identifying ownership and controlling interests submitted to the United States department of health and human services in fulfillment of a condition of participation in programs established according to title V, XVIII, XIX, and XX. To the extent that information disclosed on this form duplicates information required to be filed under subdivision (a) or (b), filing a copy of the form shall satisfy the requirements under those subdivisions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) If requested by the director, a provider shall supply complete and truthful information as to his or her professional qualifications and training, and his or her licensure in each jurisdiction in which the provider is licensed or authorized to practice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) In the interest of review and control of utilization of services, a provider shall identify each attending, referring, or prescribing physician, dentist, or other practitioner by means of a program identification number on each claim or adjustment of a claim submitted to the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) It is the obligation of a provider to assure that services, supplies, or equipment provided to, ordered, or prescribed on behalf of a medically indigent individual by that provider will meet professionally accepted standards for the medical necessity, appropriateness, and quality of health care.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(23) If any service, supply, or equipment provided directly by a provider, or any service, supply, or equipment prescribed or ordered by a provider and delivered by someone other than that provider, is determined not to be medically necessary, not appropriate, or not otherwise in accordance with medical assistance program coverages, the provider who directly provided, ordered, or prescribed the service, supply, or equipment is responsible for direct and complete repayment of any program payment made to the provider or to any other person for that service, supply, or equipment. Services, supplies, or equipment provided by a consulting provider based upon his or her independent evaluation or assessment of the recipient's needs is the responsibility of the consulting provider. This subsection does not apply to repayment by a provider who has ordered a nursing home or hospital admission of the service billed by and reimbursed to a nursing home or hospital. This section also does not apply to a nursing home or hospital unless the nursing home or hospital acted on its own initiative in providing the service, supply, or equipment as opposed to following the order or prescription of another.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(24) A provider shall satisfy or make acceptable arrangement to satisfy all previous adjudicated program liabilities including those adjudicated according to section 111c or established by agreement between the department and the provider, and restitution ordered by a court. As used in this subsection, provider includes, but is not limited to, the provider, the provider's corporation, partnership, business associates, employees, clinic, laboratory, provider group, or successors and assignees. For a nursing home or hospital, "business associates", as used in this subsection, means those persons whose identity is required to be disclosed under section 20142(3) of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.20142.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(25) A provider who is a physician, dentist, or other individual practitioner shall file with the department a complete and factual disclosure of the identity of each employer or contractor to whom the provider is required to submit, in whole or in part, payment for services provided to a medically indigent individual as a condition of the provider's agreement of employment or other agreement. A provider who has properly disclosed the required information by filing a form or forms has 30 business days in which to report changes in the list of identified individuals and entities. The disclosure required by this subsection may serve as the provider's authorization for the department to make direct payments to the employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(26) As a condition of receiving payment for services rendered to a medically indigent individual, a provider may enter, as an employee, into agreements of employment of the type described in subsection (25) only with an employer who has entered into an agreement as described in subsection (27).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(27) An employer described in subsection (25) shall enter into an agreement on a form prescribed by the department, in which, as a condition of directly receiving payment for services provided by its employee provider to a medically indigent individual, the employer agrees to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) To require as a condition of employment that the employee provider submit, in whole or in part, payments received for services provided to medically indigent individuals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) To advise the department within 30 days after any changes in the employment relationship.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) To comply with the conditions of participation established by this subsection and subsections (6) to (19) and (21).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) To agree to be jointly and severally responsible with the employee provider for any overpayments resulting from the department's direct payment under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) To agree that disputed claims relative to overpayments shall be adjudicated in administrative proceedings convened under section 111c.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(28) If a provider who is a nursing home intends to withdraw from participation in the title XIX program, the provider shall notify the department in writing. The provider shall continue to participate in the title XIX program for each patient who was admitted to the nursing home before the date notice is given under this subsection and who is or may become eligible to receive medical assistance under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(29) A provider shall protect, maintain, retain, and dispose of patient medical records and other individually identifying information in accordance with subsection (6), any other applicable state or federal law, and the most recent provider agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(30) At a minimum, if a provider is authorized to dispose of patient records or other patient identifying information, including records required by subsection (6), the provider shall ensure that medical records that identify a patient and other individually identifying information are sufficiently deleted, shredded, incinerated, or disposed of in a fashion that will protect the confidentiality of the patient's health care information and personal information. The department may take action to enforce this subsection. If the department cannot enforce compliance with this subsection, the department may enter into a contract or make other arrangements to ensure that patient records and other individually identifying information are disposed of in a fashion that will protect the confidentiality of the patient's health care information and personal information and assess costs associated with that disposal against the provider. The provider's responsibilities with regard to maintenance, retention, and disposal of patient medical records and other individually identifying information continue after the provider ceases to participate in the medical assistance program for the time period specified under this section.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>400.111c Duties of director in carrying out authority conferred by MCL 400.111a(7)(d).</B><P>
</P>
<P>Sec. 111c.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   To carry out the authority conferred by section 111a(7)(d), the director shall do 1 or more of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Accept an assurance of repayment of amounts alleged to be due to the state department. The assurance shall not constitute an admission of guilt nor be introduced in any other civil or criminal proceeding. The assurance may include a stipulation for either of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The voluntary payment to the state department by the provider of the amount alleged to be due to the state department.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   The voluntary payment, to an aggrieved medically indigent individual specified by the director, by the provider of the amount alleged to be due to the medically indigent individual.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Hold or institute a hearing in conformity with chapter 4 and chapter 6 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, as amended, being sections 24.271 to 24.287 and 24.301 to 24.306 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. The presiding officer at a hearing shall determine if an amount is due the state and shall include the determination in his or her proposal for decision. Except as provided in section 111f(4), the director shall not delegate the authority to make a final decision in a contested case under this subdivision. A hearing shall be concluded not later than 90 days after being commenced, unless otherwise agreed upon by the department and the provider or providers. The proposal for decision shall be rendered not later than 45 days after the hearing is concluded. Exceptions may be filed not later than 10 days after the date of mailing the proposal for decision. The director shall render a final decision not later than 15 days after the date of closure for the filing of exceptions. The final decision in a contested case under this subdivision may contain an order directing payment of an amount found to be due the state. The final decision may order immediate payment of the entire amount or may allow the provider a period of time which is reasonable under the circumstances to pay the state. The order shall specify the period of time allowed and a rate of interest, equal to the current rate being earned by the state treasurer's common cash fund, to be paid by the provider during that time regardless of the method of payment. The interest shall be computed from the date of the overpayment notice, but shall not be applied to medicaid interim payment overpayments. Upon the provider's failure to comply with the order in a timely manner, the director shall request the department of attorney general to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the order. Failure to appeal the final order within 30 days after receipt of a copy of the order shall foreclose the provider from collateral attack against the order or any underlying determination.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Hold an informal meeting, as provided in this section, with the provider or authorized representative of the provider, after giving written notice to the provider. The purpose of an informal meeting is to offer the provider the opportunity to be heard and to negotiate a withholding of an amount, pending an administrative hearing and final decision on the merits pursuant to chapters 4 and 6 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, being sections 24.271 to 24.287 and 24.301 to 24.306 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. The amount withheld shall not be more than the ratio of overpayment to the total paid volume from present and future medical assistance payments based on billings submitted by the provider, and shall be deposited into an interest-bearing escrow account. If the provider and the state department are unable to reach a negotiated withheld amount by the commencement of the hearing on the merits pursuant to subsection (1)(a)(i), the state department shall withhold an amount equal to not more than 25% of the present and future payments. This subdivision shall not be applied with respect to a nursing home or a hospital. The agreement shall not constitute an admission of guilt nor be introduced in any other civil or criminal proceeding. If both parties agree as to a disposition of the state department's claim, the state department shall cancel the scheduled administrative hearing. The following procedure shall be complied with regardless of any agreement on the amount to be withheld pending the outcome of the hearing:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The dates of an informal meeting and of the administrative hearing shall be set forth in the notification to the provider that alleges excess payments have been received. That notification shall be in the form of registered mail, receipted by the addressee, or by proof of service to the provider or representative of the provider.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   An informal meeting shall be concluded not later than 35 calendar days after the date of notification to the provider, and the administrative hearing shall be scheduled for the forty-fifth calendar day from the date of notification. The director shall have the administrative hearing convened on the forty-fifth day regardless of the cause on the part of either party for delay in concluding the informal meeting within 36 calendar days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   If the withholding of an amount has not been agreed upon by the time of the start of an administrative hearing on the merits, the state department may seek a withholding from present and future payment from billings submitted by the provider of not more than 25% of such payments. The withholding shall be in effect for the pendency of the hearing on the merits and until a decision on the merits. The provider shall have the opportunity to respond to the state department's withholding request. The state department's showing and the decision of the administrative law judge shall be based on all of the following criteria, with each reason stated individually in the opinion:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)   A showing based upon specific stated facts that probable cause exists that reimbursement in excess of the reimbursement to which provider is entitled has occurred.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(B)   A showing that the reimbursement cited in subparagraph (iii)(A) amounts to a specific percentage of payments made, as characterized by a statistically valid audit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(C)   A showing that 1 or more services of the same type included in the case, for which the state department is seeking a withholding of funds, has occurred at least once during the most recent 2 calendar quarters prior to the date of notice to the provider.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)   Any finding of an administrative law judge providing for withholding shall be in effect unless modified by the administrative law judge until the director's final decision on the case. If the administrative law judge rules that an amount shall be withheld from the provider, those funds shall be placed in an interest bearing escrow account. If the final ruling by the administrative law judge determines an amount is due to the state department, and that amount is less than the amount withheld, the provider shall be awarded the difference and proportionate interest of the funds held in escrow.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(v)   The hearing shall be on the merits of the claim of the state department or provider, or both, and shall be concluded not later than 90 days after being commenced unless otherwise agreed upon by the department and the provider or providers. The administrative law judge shall render a proposal for decision on the merits of the department's claim not later than 90 days after conclusion of the hearing, and shall advise both parties that exceptions may be filed with the administrative law judge not later than 15 days after the date of mailing the proposal for decision.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi)   The director shall make a final decision not later than 15 days after the date of closure for the filing of exceptions, and shall not delegate authority to make a final decision in a contested case under this section. The final decision in a contested case under this section shall contain an order directing payment of an amount found to be due to the state or the provider. The final decision may order immediate payment of the entire amount or may allow the provider a period of time which is reasonable under the circumstances to pay the state. The order shall specify the manner of payment, including the period of time allowed and a rate of interest equal to the current rate being earned by the state treasurer's common cash fund to be paid by the provider on all repayments other than the interest bearing withheld amount, to be computed from the date of the notification issued pursuant to this section. Upon the provider's failure to timely comply with the order, the director shall request the attorney general to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the order. Failure to appeal the final order within 30 days after receipt of a copy of the order shall foreclose the provider from collateral attack against the order or any underlying determination.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii)   If the foregoing means are not adequate to secure recovery of payments, the director shall do 1 or more of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)   File as a creditor in insolvency proceedings.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(B)   Initiate emergency action pursuant to section 111f.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(C)   Bring an action for other legal or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, including, but not limited to, an order to increase, for cause, the 25% withholding limit, an injunction to prevent the removal of attachable assets, an order to sequester assets, or an order for the appointment of a receiver to take possession of attachable assets.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For purposes of this section, "provider" includes an employer who has executed an agreement conforming to section 111(b)(27).</DIV>

<P>Sec. 111f.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The director may issue an order incorporating a finding that emergency action is required to protect the state's interest, as the state's interest is described in this subsection by the statement of circumstances warranting emergency action, in any of the following: the public health, welfare, or safety; medically indigent individuals; or public funds of the program of medical assistance. Circumstances that warrant emergency action include, but are not limited to, any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A reasonable belief, determined in accordance with professionally accepted standards, that rendered services for which a provider has submitted claims were medically unnecessary, inappropriate, or of inferior quality, and therefore that the continued participation in the program by the provider or payments to the provider for services constitutes a threat to the public health, safety, or welfare or to the health, safety, or welfare of recipient medically indigent individuals.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A reasonable belief that the provider has violated the medicaid false claims act, Act No. 72 of the Public Acts of 1977, being sections 400.601 to 400.613 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, the health care false claims act, Act No. 323 of the Public Acts of 1984, being sections 752.1001 to 752.1011 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, or a substantially similar statute of another state or the federal government.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A reasonable belief that the overpayment sought to be recovered pursuant to this section, or pursuant to any other section of this act, is in jeopardy of not being recovered.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A reasonable belief that 10% or $10,000.00, whichever is less, for a noninstitutional provider, or 10% or $50,000.00, whichever is less, for an institutional provider, of the provider's total program dollar amount for claims submitted at any time during the most recent 12-month period was unsubstantiated or was for services that were noncovered.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   A reasonable belief that 10% or $10,000.00, whichever is less, for a noninstitutional provider, or 10% or $50,000.00, whichever is less, for an institutional provider, of the provider's total program dollar amount for claims submitted at any time during the most recent 12-month period were medically unnecessary, inappropriate, or of inferior quality.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   A reasonable belief that 15% or $15,000.00, whichever is less, for a noninstitutional provider, or 15% or $75,000.00, whichever is less, for an institutional provider, of the provider's total program dollar amount for claims submitted at any time during a consecutive 12-month period, and that 5% or $5,000.00, whichever is less, for a noninstitutional provider, or 5% or $25,000.00, whichever is less, for an institutional provider, of the provider's total program dollar amount for claims submitted during the most recent 12-month period, was for services that were noncovered.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   A reasonable belief that 15% or $15,000.00, whichever is less, for a noninstitutional provider, or 15% or $75,000.00, whichever is less, for an institutional provider, of the provider's claims submitted at any time during a consecutive 12-month period, and that 5% or $5,000.00, whichever is less, for a noninstitutional provider, or 5% or $25,000.00, whichever is less, for an institutional provider, of the provider's total program dollar amount for claims submitted during the most recent 12-month period, was for services that were medically unnecessary, inappropriate, or of inferior quality.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   A reasonable belief that the provider is refusing to comply with section 111b(7), (19), or (25).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the director finds that emergency action is required under subsection (1) in a clinic, corporation, partnership, or other entity with multiple providers or locations, the director may extend any emergency action to the entire legal entity and its providers.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   As used in subsection (1), "most recent 12-month period" means a period of not more than 12 consecutive months within the 15 consecutive months immediately preceding the notice to the provider that an emergency action has been taken.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In order to determine whether the conditions described in subsection (1)(a), (d), (e), (f), or (g) exist, the director shall consult with peer review advisory committees, professionals, or experts who are individuals of the same licensed profession as the provider subject to the action, as selected by the director.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Upon a determination that circumstances described in subsection (1) exist, the director may issue an order for the summary suspension of payments on pending or subsequent claims, in whole or in part, or for the summary suspension of a provider from participation in the program of medical assistance. The summary suspension shall be effective on the date specified in the order or on service of a certified copy of the order on the provider, whichever occurs later, and shall remain in effect during administrative or judicial proceedings on the suspension. Upon request of a provider, a contested case hearing pursuant to chapter 4 and chapter 6 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, being sections 24.271 to 24.287 and 24.301 to 24.306 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, shall be commenced not later than 15 days after the summary suspension. If a contested case hearing is requested by a provider relative to an emergency suspension under this section, a hearing shall be held to determine whether the emergency suspension is supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record. Under appropriate circumstances, the state department may hold or institute a hearing under section 111c(1), or take an action under section 111d at the same time an action is taken under this section, while an action under this section is pending, or after a decision on an action is made. The presiding officer may consolidate the 2 hearings into a single proceeding in the interest of economy. However, the director shall not make a final decision in a contested case under section 111c(1) or 111d arising from or related to an emergency action or the circumstances upon which an emergency action was taken.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A hearing, conference, or similar meeting between a provider or representative of a provider and the state department shall not be required to be held or conducted before the emergency suspension of payment to the provider or the emergency suspension of participation of the provider in the program of medical assistance under this section.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The total of all distributions or expenditures from state or federal funds for the state fiscal year beginning October 1, 1997 for that county related to county juvenile agency services, including the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   That portion of the distribution to the county under section 117a for county juvenile agency services calculated without regard to any exclusion of expenditure on the basis that the expenditure exceeded the amount of a budget approved under section 117c.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   Community-based programs, including halfway house or day treatment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)   Staff costs, including salaries and fringe benefits, for all employees employed to administer or deliver programs providing county juvenile agency services, including county juvenile officers, delinquency or service workers, and related supervisory, clerical, and administrative staff support.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For the state fiscal year beginning October 1, 1999, the base amount for a county shall be adjusted by both of the multipliers calculated under subsection (3) to determine the block grant amount for that state fiscal year. The block grant amount for each subsequent state fiscal year is calculated by adjusting the block grant amount for the previous state fiscal year by the multipliers calculated under subsection (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   For each state fiscal year, the following multipliers shall be calculated:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The percentage change appropriated in that state fiscal year to change the rate of payments to vendors providing placements for juveniles for that state fiscal year from the previous state fiscal year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The percentage change in the county's juvenile population from the county's juvenile population for the previous fiscal year as determined from the United States decennial census or projections by the United States census bureau. As used in this subdivision, "county's juvenile population" means the number of individuals residing in the county who are 10 or more years of age but less than 18 years of age.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The calculations under subsections (2) and (3) apply regardless of the state fiscal year in which a county becomes a county juvenile agency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A block grant for a county determined under subsections (1) to (4) for a state fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount calculated by subtracting the amount determined under subdivision (a) from the amount determined under subdivision (b) and multiplying that difference by 50% of the per-child cost for educational services to state wards in state operated training schools and treatment and detention facilities during the state fiscal year beginning October 1, 1998:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The average daily population of public wards in state operated training schools and treatment and detention facilities for whom the county has assumed responsibility as a county juvenile agency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The average daily population of public wards for the county.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Fifty percent of the amount of block grant funds expended during the state fiscal year for educational services to public wards for whom the county has assumed responsibility as a county juvenile agency shall be deducted from the amount calculated under subsection (5).</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A child under 17 years of age, provision for whose support and education has been made under regulations of the department, may be admitted to the Michigan children's institute by commitment to the department. All children committed to the Michigan children's institute shall be considered committed to the department and shall be subject to review by the juvenile division of the probate court under chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.1 to 712A.32. The superintendent of the institute shall represent the state as guardian of each child committed beginning with the day the child is admitted and continuing until the child is 19, unless the superintendent or the department discharges the child sooner as provided in section 8 or 9 or if the child is at least 18 years of age but less than 21 years of age and is participating in extended foster care services as described in section 11 of the young adult voluntary foster care act. Wherever commitment to the Michigan children's institute is mentioned in any law of this state, it shall be construed to mean commitment to the department. A child may be committed to the department by either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) By the juvenile division of the probate court, if the child is within the court's jurisdiction under section 2(b) of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.2.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) By the probate court, if the child is a ward of the court and the court has denied an order of adoption for the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) By observation order. If a child has been decreed to be a ward of the probate court or the juvenile division of the probate court has acquired formal jurisdiction of a child, and it appears to the probate court that, because of the circumstances of the case or because the child's condition might be benefited, the court may make a temporary commitment to the department and direct that the child be taken to a facility of the Michigan children's institute for observation for a period not to exceed 90 days. Before the expiration of this order of observation, the superintendent of the institute shall report to the probate court the results of the observation of the child. If the superintendent reports to the probate court that the order of observation should be extended or that the child is in need of treatment for emotional disturbance that does not require hospital care and for which the institute has facilities, then the court may extend the temporary commitment and continue the observation order or establish a treatment period for the child to any date prior to the nineteenth birthday of the child. If the child has ceased to be a ward of the court, written consent of the person or persons lawfully having custody of the child shall be secured. Before the expiration of this extended order of observation or treatment, the superintendent shall report to the probate court the results of the observation or treatment of the child and an opinion stating what disposition can be made of the child. Before any child is sent to a facility of the institute for observation, the superintendent of the institute shall notify the probate court that there is room to receive the child and shall designate the facility of the institute for the reception of the child. The commission may by regulation establish conditions for the reimbursement of the expense of caring for the child while under the supervision of the institute if the parents or other persons responsible for the child's support are financially able to pay reasonable costs of the child's care.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The superintendent of the institute has the power to make decisions on behalf of a child committed to the institute. The attorney general or his or her representative shall represent the Michigan children's institute superintendent in any court proceeding in which the superintendent considers such representation necessary to carry out his or her duties under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) As used in this act, "department" means the department of human services.</div>

<P>Sec. 7.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The department shall promulgate necessary rules for the maintenance, health, instruction, and training of the children under the control of the Michigan children's institute, for placing them in homes, and for their supervision while they remain public wards. The liability of a county for the cost of a child's care shall be determined under the youth rehabilitation services act, 1974 PA 150, MCL 803.301 to 803.309.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The superintendent is the authorized agent of the department to implement this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The superintendent or the department may receive any donation, grant, or personal property for the benefit of the children of the Michigan children's institute. Upon receiving a donation, grant, or personal property, the superintendent or the department shall remit it within 30 days to the state treasury to be credited to the Michigan children's institute trust fund, which is created in the state treasury.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The department may utilize facilities existing in a county in caring for children and may accept the services of a voluntary organization for the benefit of the children, subject to rules promulgated by the department.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   An agreement entered into with a person for the care of a child who is a ward of the Michigan children's institute shall provide that the department may cancel the agreement if, in the department's opinion, the interest of the child requires it. If a parent or relative within the third degree of consanguinity or affinity of a child who is a ward of the institute establishes a suitable home and is capable and willing to support the child, the department may restore the child to his or her parent or relative. The institute may assist the parent or relative with the support of the child if the aid is less than the cost of care the institute would otherwise provide.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The department may place and maintain a child under the control of the institute in a licensed boarding home for children. The expense of supervision and transportation of the child to the home shall be paid out of money appropriated to the institute, subject to partial reimbursement by the county liable as provided in this section.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The director of the department shall direct the office to designate a period of not less than 90 days that ends not more than 7 months after the effective date of this section as a child support arrearage amnesty period. Under the terms and conditions set forth in subsection (2), the director, or the director's designee, shall grant a payer amnesty, waiving all criminal and civil penalties provided by law for the payer's failure or refusal to pay past due child support. Amnesty granted under this section waives criminal and civil penalties for failure or refusal to pay child support only in regard to the child support arrearage that the payer pays in total to qualify for amnesty.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) To qualify for amnesty under this section, a payer shall pay his or her child support arrearage amount either in total with the submission of the written amnesty request or by paying not less than 50% of the total amount with the submission of the written amnesty request and the balance before the amnesty period ends. A payer's amnesty is effective on the date the director, or the director's designee, receives the payer's written amnesty request with the payment of not less than 50% of the total child support arrearage amount. If a payer pays less than 100% of the total child support arrearage amount with the amnesty request, the payer's amnesty terminates at the end of the amnesty period unless the balance is paid before the amnesty period ends.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A payer is not eligible to qualify for amnesty under this section if, before the payer submits the written request for amnesty and a payment as required by subsection (2), 1 or more of the following occur:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Prosecution is initiated against the payer under section 161, 165, or 167(1)(a) or (2) of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.161, 750.165, and 750.167.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The payer is arrested on a criminal warrant or bench warrant related to the payer's failure or refusal to pay past due child support.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The office shall administer the amnesty program established by this section. As part of its administrative duties, at least 60 days before the start of the amnesty period, the office shall notify payers who may be eligible for amnesty under this section because they owe a child support arrearage. A description of the amnesty program included in scheduled notices and posted on the department's website is sufficient compliance with this notification requirement.</div>

In the case of refusal to comply with a subpoena or request for information, the circuit court may issue an order requiring the person to appear and to produce books, records, and papers.

</P>
<P>Sec. 7.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The department shall develop a schedule for the transition from receipt and disbursement of support and fees by offices of the friend of the court to centralized receipt and disbursement by the state disbursement unit. The schedule may provide for the transition to take place in stages so that, during the transition period, the SDU is responsible for the receipt and disbursement of the support and fee payments of less than all the payers and recipients of support whose cases are administered by a particular office of the friend of the court. In developing the schedule, the department shall consult with other state agencies and with local agencies.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In accordance with section 9 of the friend of the court act, 1982 PA 294, MCL 552.509, and the transition schedule developed under subsection (1), SDU receipt and disbursement applies to the case of a payer or recipient of support starting on the date specified in a notification to the office of the friend of the court, which administers the case, that the SDU is prepared to receive and disburse support and fees for the case or for a class of cases to which the case belongs. As of the date that SDU receipt and disbursement of support and fees applies to a particular support order, a provision in the order directing support and fees to be paid to an office of the friend of the court shall be considered to direct the payments to the SDU.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   While held by the state disbursement unit, money the SDU receives as a support payment is the money of the recipient of support, is not public revenue, and shall not be deposited in the state treasury. While held by the state disbursement unit, money the SDU receives as a support payment is not subject to levy, execution, garnishment, or offset.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Interest that accrues on a payment after its receipt and before its disbursement is payable to the state general fund to offset program costs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a contractor operates the state disbursement unit, the contractor is directly responsible to the office. The office shall not enter a contract for operation of the SDU until the state budget director approves each contract provision that governs the accounting system to be used by the contractor. In addition to auditing by a private sector accounting firm, the contractor operating the SDU is subject to audit by the state executive branch and by the auditor general or an independent public accounting firm appointed by the auditor general. The auditor general or an independent public accounting firm appointed by the auditor general shall conduct an audit of the SDU not less than 1 year, but within 2 years, after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this section and not less than every 2 years after that initial audit. The department shall cooperate with the auditor general.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Except for disclosure in a manner authorized by law, rule, or regulation, a person shall not disclose information regarding a payer or recipient of support that is provided to the SDU for the purpose of receipt or disbursement of support or fees. A person that violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $500.00, or both.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A contractor or subcontractor, or an officer or employee of a contractor or subcontractor, that operates the SDU who negligently discloses information regarding a payer or recipient of support is liable for actual damages or $1,000.00, whichever is greater, plus costs and attorney fees. A contractor or subcontractor, or an officer or employee of a contractor or subcontractor, that operates the SDU who intentionally discloses information regarding a payer or recipient of support is liable for 3 times actual damages or $3,000.00, whichever is greater, plus costs and attorney fees. Each negligent or intentional disclosure that gives rise to liability under this section is a separate cause of action for which separate damages may be awarded.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Based on criteria established by the office and the state court administrative office, the office may centralize administrative enforcement procedures for services provided under title IV-D. The office may also centralize enforcement activities for friend of the court cases based on criteria established by the office and the state court administrative office. The criteria for centralizing enforcement activities for a friend of the court case shall require, at a minimum, both of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That support enforcement measures undertaken by the office of the friend of the court have been unsuccessful, including, but not limited to, a lack of regular and substantial payments against the arrearage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   That the arrearage is equal to or greater than the amount of support payable either for 12 months or, if the recipient of support requests centralization of enforcement activities, for 6 months.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Each office of the friend of the court shall provide the office with information necessary for the office to identify cases eligible for centralized enforcement, as well as case information necessary for the office to pursue enforcement remedies.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The office's centralized enforcement may include, but is not limited to, 1 or more of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   An enforcement remedy available under the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.601 to 552.650.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The office shall develop a system to track each friend of the court case selected for centralized enforcement so that the office of the friend of the court from which the case is selected can be identified. The office shall process collections resulting from centralized enforcement through the SDU and, for the purpose of child support incentive calculations, shall credit those collections to the office of the friend of the court identified with the case. In consultation with the state court administrative office, the office shall establish policies and procedures for expenses related to enforcement activities under this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   This section does not limit the office's ability to enter into agreements for child support enforcement with an office of the friend of the court, law enforcement agency, prosecutor, government unit, or private entity as that ability existed on the effective date of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Within 1 year after the effective date of this section and within 1 year after the deadline for the previous report, the office shall submit an annual report to the legislature regarding friend of the court cases assigned to a private collection agency for support collection under a contract with the office.

The order shall have the same force and effect as a subpoena and, upon application of the attorney general, the order may be enforced by a court having jurisdiction over the person or the circuit court for the county of Ingham or for the county where the person receiving the order resides or is found, in the same manner as though the notice were a subpoena.

</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Michigan’s population is rapidly aging. Already, residents 50 and older make up 37 percent of the state’s population. By 2025 – 10 years ahead of the national projection – Michigan residents 65 and older will outnumber those younger than 18.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Active aging is a life-long process and state government has an important role to play in ensuring that Michigan is a leader among states in healthy and active aging for all. Our Department of Health and Human Services plays a critical role ensuring that services to the aging are delivered holistically and effectively. However, these services are currently divided between multiple agencies within MDHHS, including the Medical Services Administration and the Aging and Adult Services Agency. Bringing these services together under the umbrella of the newly established Health and Aging Services Administration will strengthen the continuum of support and services by improving collaboration and efficiency among programs serving an aging population.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Governor Milliken recognized the importance of having an effective and visible advocate for aging and older persons in all government decisions when he signed the Older Michiganians Act, 1981 PA 180, creating the Commission on Services to the Aging. This order maintains the independence of the Commission, while elevating the voices of the aging community to the highest levels of the Department. Going forward, in addition to its responsibilities developing the state plan on aging, the Commission will advise the Director on how to best support an aging population in developing and implementing the Department’s strategic priorities.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The attorney general or an assistant attorney general on behalf of the attorney general may conduct an investigation of an alleged violation of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For purposes of enforcing this act, the attorney general may appoint investigators who shall be peace officers and whose powers shall include, but not be limited to, the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The power to execute and serve search warrants, arrest warrants, subpoenas, administrative warrants, and summonses issued under the authority of the state.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the attorney general has reasonable cause to believe that a person has information or is in possession, custody, or control of any document or other tangible object relevant to an investigation for violation of this act, the attorney general may serve upon the person, before bringing any action, a written demand to appear and be examined under oath, and to produce the document or object for inspection and copying. The demand shall include all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Be served upon the person in the manner required for service of process in this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Describe the nature of the conduct constituting the violation under investigation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Describe the document or object with sufficient definiteness to permit it to be fairly identified.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Contain a copy of any written interrogatories.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Prescribe a reasonable time at which the person must appear to testify, within which to answer the written interrogatories, and within which the document or object must be produced, and advise the person that objections to or reasons for not complying with the demand may be filed with the attorney general, on or before that time.</DIV>

Notice of hearing the action and a copy of all pleadings shall be served upon the person, who may appear in opposition. If the court finds that the demand is proper, that there is reasonable cause to believe that there may have been or is presently occurring a violation of this act, and that the information sought or document or object demanded is relevant to the investigation, the court shall order the person to comply with the demand, subject to modification the court may prescribe. Upon motion by the person and for good cause shown, the court may make any further order in the proceedings that justice requires to protect the person from unreasonable annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, burden, or expense.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Except as required by federal law, any procedure, testimony taken, or material produced shall be kept confidential by the attorney general before bringing an action against a person under this act for the violation under investigation, unless confidentiality is waived by the person being investigated and the person who has testified, answered interrogatories, or produced material, or disclosure is authorized by the court.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Any person may bring a civil action in the name of this state under this section to recover losses that this state suffers from a violation of this act. A suit filed under this section shall not be dismissed unless the attorney general has been notified and had an opportunity to appear and oppose the dismissal. The attorney general waives the opportunity to oppose the dismissal if it is not exercised within 28 days of receiving notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a person other than the attorney general initiates an action under this section, the complaint shall remain under seal and the clerk shall not issue the summons for service on the defendant until after the time for the attorney general's election under subsection (3) expires. At the time of filing the complaint, the person shall serve a copy of the complaint on the attorney general and shall disclose, in writing, substantially all material evidence and information in the person's possession supporting the complaint to the attorney general.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The attorney general may elect to intervene in an action under this section. Before the expiration of the later of 90 days after service of the complaint and related materials or any extension of the 90 days that is requested by the attorney general and granted by the court, the attorney general shall notify the court and the person initiating the action of 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That the attorney general will proceed with the action for this state and have primary responsibility for proceeding with the action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That the attorney general declines to take over the action and the person initiating the action has the right to proceed with the action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If an action is filed under this section, a person other than the attorney general shall not intervene in the action or bring another action on behalf of this state based on the facts underlying the action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the attorney general elects to proceed with the action under subsection (3) or (6), the attorney general has primary responsibility for prosecuting the action and may do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Agree to dismiss the action, notwithstanding the objection of the person initiating the action, but only if that person has been notified of and offered the opportunity to participate in a hearing on the motion to dismiss. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Settle the action, notwithstanding the objection of the person initiating the action, but only if that person has been notified of and offered the opportunity to participate in a hearing on the settlement and if the court determines that the settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under the circumstances. Upon a showing of good cause, the settlement hearing may be held in camera.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Request the court to limit the participation of the person initiating the action. If the attorney general demonstrates that unrestricted participation by the person initiating the action during the litigation would interfere with or unduly delay the attorney general's prosecution of the case or would be repetitious, irrelevant, or unduly harassing, the court may do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Limit the number of the person's witnesses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Limit the length of the testimony of the person's witnesses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Limit the person's cross-examination of witnesses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Otherwise limit the person's participation in the litigation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the attorney general notifies the court that he or she declines to take over the action under subsection (3), the person who initiated the action may proceed with the action. At the attorney general's request and expense, the attorney general shall be provided with copies of all pleadings filed in the action and copies of all deposition transcripts. Notwithstanding the attorney general's election not to take over the action, the court may permit the attorney general to intervene in the action at any time upon a showing of good cause and, subject to subsection (7), without affecting the rights or status of the person initiating the action. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Upon a showing, conducted in camera, that actions of the person initiating the action during discovery would interfere with the attorney general's investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter, the court may stay the discovery for not more than 90 days. The court may extend the stay upon a further showing that the attorney general is pursuing the investigation or proceeding with reasonable diligence and the discovery would interfere with the ongoing investigation or proceeding. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As an alternative to an action permitted under this section, the attorney general may pursue a violation of this act through any alternate remedy available to this state, including an administrative proceeding. If the attorney general pursues an alternate remedy, a person who initiated an action under this section shall have equivalent rights in that proceeding to the rights that the person would have had if the action had continued under this section to the extent consistent with the law governing that proceeding. Findings of fact and conclusions of law that become final in an alternative proceeding shall be conclusive on the parties to an action under this section. For purposes of this subsection, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court, if the time for filing an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Subject to subsections (10) and (11), if a person other than the attorney general or the attorney general prevails in an action that the person initiates under this section, the court shall award the person necessary expenses, costs, reasonable attorney fees, and, based on the amount of effort involved, the following percentage of the monetary proceeds resulting from the action or any settlement of the claim: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the attorney general intervenes, 15% to 25%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the attorney general does not intervene, 25% to 30%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If the court finds an action under this section to be based primarily on disclosure of specific information that was not provided by the person bringing the action, such as information from a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing in a state or federal department or agency, a legislative report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or the news media, and the attorney general proceeds with the action, the court may award the person bringing the action no more than 10% of the monetary recovery in addition to reasonable attorney fees, necessary expenses, and costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If the court finds that the person bringing an action under this section planned and initiated the conduct upon which the action is brought, then the court may reduce or eliminate, as it considers appropriate, the share of the proceeds of the action that the person would otherwise be entitled to receive. A person who is convicted of criminal conduct arising from a violation of this act shall not initiate or remain a party to an action under this section and is not entitled to share in the monetary proceeds resulting from the action or any settlement under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A person other than the attorney general shall not bring an action under this section that is based on allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding to which this state or the federal government is already a party. The court shall dismiss an action brought in violation of this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Unless the person is the original source of the information, a person, other than the attorney general, shall not initiate an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a state or federal legislative, investigative, or administrative report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media. The person is the original source if he or she had direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and voluntarily provided the information to the attorney general before filing an action based on that information under this section. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) This state and the attorney general are not liable for any expenses, costs, or attorney fees that a person incurs in bringing an action under this section. Any amount awarded to a person initiating an action to enforce this act is payable solely from the proceeds of the action or settlement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) If a person proceeds with an action under this section after being notified that the attorney general has declined to intervene and the court finds that the claim was frivolous, as defined in section 2591 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.2591, the court shall award the prevailing defendant actual and reasonable attorney fees and expenses and, in addition, shall impose a civil fine of not more than $10,000.00. The civil fine shall be deposited into the Michigan medicaid benefits trust fund established in section 5 of the Michigan trust fund act, 2000 PA 489, MCL 12.255.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The department shall not issue a license to or renew the license of an owner, partner, or director of the applicant, who has regular direct access to residents or who has on-site facility operational responsibilities, or an applicant or the licensee designee, if any of those individuals have been convicted of 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A felony under this act or under chapter XXA of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.145m to 750.145r. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If the department has revoked, suspended, or refused to renew a person's license, or denied an application for a license, for an adult foster care facility according to section 22, the department may refuse to issue a license to or renew a license of that person for a period of 5 years after the suspension, revocation, or nonrenewal of the license, or denial of the application.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The department may refuse to issue a license to or renew the license of an applicant if the department determines that the applicant has a relationship with a former licensee whose license under this act has been suspended, revoked, or nonrenewed under subsection (9) or section 22 or a convicted person to whom a license has been denied under subsection (9). This subsection applies for 5 years after the suspension, revocation, or nonrenewal of the former licensee's license or the denial of the convicted person's license. For purposes of this subsection, an applicant has a relationship with a former licensee or convicted person if the former licensee or convicted person is involved with the facility in 1 or more of the following ways:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Participates in the administration or operation of the facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Has a financial interest in the operation of the facility.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Is employed by the facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Resides in the facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If the department determines that an unlicensed facility is an adult foster care facility, the department shall notify the owner or operator of the facility that it is required to be licensed under this act. A person receiving the notification required under this section who does not apply for a license within 30 days is subject to the penalties described in subsection (13).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Subject to subsection (12), a person who violates subsection (1) is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 2 years or a fine of not more than $50,000.00, or both. A person who has been convicted of a violation of subsection (1) who commits a second or subsequent violation is guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years or a fine of not more than $75,000.00, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) The department shall issue an initial or renewal license not later than 6 months after the applicant files a completed application. Receipt of the application is considered the date the application is received by an agency or department of this state. If the application is considered incomplete by the department, the department shall notify the applicant in writing or make notice electronically available within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting additional information. If the department identifies a deficiency or requires the fulfillment of a corrective action plan, the 6-month period is tolled until either of the following occurs:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Upon notification by the department of a deficiency, until the date the requested information is received by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Upon notification by the department that a corrective action plan is required, until the date the department determines the requirements of the corrective action plan have been met.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) The determination of the completeness of an application does not operate as an approval of the application for the license and does not confer eligibility of an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) If the department fails to issue or deny a license within the time required by this section, the department shall return the license fee and shall reduce the license fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. Failure to issue or deny a license within the time period required under this section does not allow the department to otherwise delay processing an application. The completed application shall be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of an application based on the fact that the application fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) If, on a continual basis, inspections performed by a local health department delay the department in issuing or denying licenses under this act within the 6-month period, the department may use department staff to complete the inspections instead of the local health department causing the delays.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) The department director shall submit a report by December 1 of each year to the standing committees and appropriations subcommittees of the senate and house of representatives concerned with human services issues. The department director shall include all of the following information in the report concerning the preceding fiscal year:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The number of applications rejected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The number of licenses not issued within the 6-month period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The average processing time for initial and renewal licenses granted after the 6-month period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) An applicant, if an individual, or an owner, partner, or director of the applicant who has regular direct access to residents or who has on-site facility operational responsibilities shall give written consent at the time of original license application and a licensee designee shall give written consent at the time of appointment for the department of state police to conduct both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A criminal history check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A criminal records check through the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) An owner, partner, or director of the applicant who has regular direct access to residents or who has on-site facility operational responsibilities is exempt from the requirements of subsection (19) if he or she has already submitted consent described in subsection (19) and were continuously affiliated with a licensed adult foster care facility as an applicant, owner, partner, or director.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) The department shall require the applicant, if an individual, the licensee designee, owner, partner, or director of the applicant who has regular direct access to residents or who has on-site facility operational responsibilities to submit his or her fingerprints to the department of state police for the criminal history check and criminal records check described in subsection (19). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) The department shall request a criminal history check and criminal records check required under this section in the manner prescribed by the department of state police. The department of state police shall conduct the criminal history check and provide a report of the results to the licensing or regulatory bureau of the department. The report shall contain any criminal history information on the person maintained by the department of state police and the results of the criminal records check from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The department of state police may charge the person on whom the criminal history check and criminal records check are performed under this section a fee that does not exceed the actual and reasonable cost of conducting the checks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(23) Beginning March 13, 2012, if an applicant or licensee designee or person described in subsection (20) applies for a license or to renew a license to operate an adult foster care facility and he or she or the licensee designee previously underwent a criminal history check and criminal records check required under subsection (19) or under section 134a of the mental health code, 1974 PA 258, MCL 330.1134a, and has remained continuously licensed or continuously employed under section 34b or under section 20173a of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.20173a, after the criminal history check and criminal records check have been performed, that person is not required to submit to another criminal history check or criminal records check upon renewal of the license obtained under subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(24) The department of state police shall store and maintain all fingerprints submitted under this act in an automated fingerprint identification system database that provides for an automatic notification at the time of a subsequent criminal arrest fingerprint card submitted into the system that matches a set of fingerprints previously submitted in accordance with this act. Upon notification, the department of state police shall immediately notify the department and the department shall take the appropriate action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(25) A licensee, licensee designee, owner, partner, or director of the licensee shall not be permitted on the premises of an adult foster care facility or have direct access to residents or resident records if he or she has been convicted of any of the following: adult abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation; or listed offenses as defined in section 2 of the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.722.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(26) An adult foster family care home or an adult foster care group home shall not be concurrently licensed as a group child care home or a family child care home.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(27) As used in this section, "completed application" means an application complete on its face with all requested information provided and answers to all questions provided and submitted with any applicable licensing fees as well as any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of this state. A completed application does not include a health inspection performed by a local health department.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The department may deny, suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew a license, or modify a regular license to a provisional license, if the licensee falsifies information on the application for license or willfully and substantially violates this act, the rules promulgated under this act, or the terms of the license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The department may deny, suspend, revoke, or modify an application for licensure or a license of a licensee if the department determines that the applicant or licensee has a relationship with a former applicant whose application under this act has been denied or a former licensee whose license under this act has been suspended, revoked, or refused renewal under this section or section 13(9) or a convicted person to whom a license has been denied under section 13(9). This subsection applies for 10 years after the suspension, revocation, or refused renewal of the former licensee's license, the denial of the former applicant's application for licensure, or the denial of the convicted person's application for licensure. As used in this subsection, an applicant has a relationship with a former licensee or convicted person if the former applicant, licensee, or convicted person is involved with the facility in 1 or more of the following ways:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Participates in the administration or operation of the facility.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An application for licensure shall not be denied, a license shall not be revoked, a renewal shall not be refused, and a regular license shall not be modified to a provisional license unless the department gives the applicant or licensee written notice of the grounds for the proposed denial, revocation, refusal to renew, or modification. If the proposed denial, revocation, refusal to renew, or modification is not appealed within 30 days after receipt, the department shall deny, revoke, refuse to renew, or modify the application or license. The applicant or licensee must appeal in writing to the department director, or the director's designee, a proposed denial, revocation, refusal to renew, or modification within 30 days after receipt of the written notice. Upon receipt of the written request for appeal, the director or the director's designee must conduct a contested case hearing under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.301 to 24.328. Notice of the hearing must be given to the applicant or licensee by personal service or delivery to the proper address by registered mail not less than 2 weeks before the date of the hearing. The decision of the director or his or her designee shall be issued as soon as practicable after the hearing and forwarded to the protesting party by registered mail. The formal notice and hearing requirement in this subsection does not apply if the licensee and the department comply with section 22a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A license shall not be denied, suspended, or revoked, a renewal shall not be refused, and a regular license shall not be modified to a provisional license unless the department gives the licensee or applicant written notice of the grounds of the proposed denial, revocation, refusal to renew, or modification. If the licensee or applicant appeals the denial, revocation, refusal to renew, or modification by filing a written appeal with the director within 30 days after receipt of the written notice, the director or the director's designated representative shall conduct a contested case hearing at which the licensee or applicant may present testimony and confront witnesses. Notice of the hearing shall be given to the licensee or applicant by personal service or delivery to the proper address by registered mail not less than 2 weeks before the date of the hearing. The decision of the director shall be made and forwarded to the protesting party by registered mail not more than 30 days after the hearing.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the department has revoked, suspended, or refused to renew a license, the former licensee shall not receive or maintain in that facility an adult who requires foster care. A person who violates this subsection is guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years or a fine of not more than $75,000.00, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the department has revoked, suspended, or refused to renew a license, relocation services shall be provided to adults who were being served by the formerly licensed facility, upon the department's determination that the adult or his or her designated representative is unable to relocate the adult in another facility without assistance. The relocation services shall be provided by the responsible agency, as defined in administrative rules, or, if the adult has no agency designated as responsible, by the department of health and human services.</div>

Upon receipt of the written consent to obtain the criminal history record information and identification required under this subsection, the adult foster care facility or staffing agency that has made a good-faith offer of employment or an independent contract to the individual shall request the criminal history record information from the relevant licensing or regulatory department and shall make a request regarding that individual to the relevant licensing or regulatory department to conduct a check of all relevant registries in the manner required in subsection (4). If the requirements of subsection (11) are not met and a request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to make a subsequent determination of the existence of any national criminal history pertaining to the individual is necessary, the adult foster care facility or staffing agency shall proceed in the manner required in subsection (5). A staffing agency that employs an individual who regularly has direct access to or provides direct services to residents under an independent contract with an adult foster care facility shall submit information regarding the criminal history check conducted by the staffing agency to the adult foster care facility that has made a good-faith offer of independent contract to that applicant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Upon receipt of the written consent to conduct a criminal history check and identification required under subsection (3), the adult foster care facility or staffing agency that has made a good-faith offer of employment or independent contract to the individual shall make a request to the department of state police to conduct a criminal history check on the individual and input the individual's fingerprints into the automated fingerprint identification system database, and shall make a request to the relevant licensing or regulatory department to perform a check of all relevant registries established according to federal and state law and regulations for any substantiated findings of abuse, neglect, or misappropriation of property. The request shall be made in a manner prescribed by the department of state police and the relevant licensing or regulatory department or agency. The adult foster care facility or staffing agency shall make the written consent and identification available to the department of state police and the relevant licensing or regulatory department or agency. Until June 30, 2020, if the department of state police or the Federal Bureau of Investigation charges a fee for conducting the criminal history check, the charge shall be paid by or reimbursed by the department. Until June 30, 2020, the adult foster care facility or staffing agency shall not seek reimbursement for a charge imposed by the department of state police or the federal bureau of investigation from the individual who is the subject of the criminal history check. Beginning July 1, 2020, if the department of state police or the Federal Bureau of Investigation charges a fee for conducting the criminal history check, the charge shall be paid by the adult foster care facility, the staffing agency, or the individual. The department of state police shall conduct a criminal history check on the individual named in the request. The department of state police shall provide the department with a written report of the criminal history check conducted under this subsection. The report shall contain any criminal history record information on the individual maintained by the department of state police.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Upon receipt of the written consent to conduct a criminal history check and identification required under subsection (3), if the individual has applied for employment either as an employee or as an independent contractor with an adult foster care facility or staffing agency, the adult foster care facility or staffing agency that has made a good-faith offer of employment or independent contract shall comply with subsection (4) and shall make a request to the department of state police to forward the individual's fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The department of state police shall request the Federal Bureau of Investigation to make a determination of the existence of any national criminal history pertaining to the individual. An individual described in this subsection shall provide the department of state police with a set of fingerprints. The department of state police shall complete the criminal history check under subsection (4) and, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, provide the results of its determination under subsection (4) and the results of the Federal Bureau of Investigation determination to the department within 30 days after the request is made. If the requesting adult foster care facility or staffing agency is not a state department or agency and if criminal history record information is disclosed on the written report of the criminal history check or the Federal Bureau of Investigation determination that resulted in a conviction, the department shall notify the adult foster care facility or staffing agency and the individual in writing of the type of crime disclosed on the written report of the criminal history check or the Federal Bureau of Investigation determination without disclosing the details of the crime. The notification shall inform the adult foster care facility or staffing agency and the applicant regarding the appeal process in section 34c and shall include a statement that the individual has a right to appeal the information relied upon by the adult foster care facility or staffing agency in making its decision regarding his or her employment eligibility based on the criminal history check. Any charges imposed by the department of state police or the Federal Bureau of Investigation for conducting a criminal history check or making a determination under this subsection shall be paid in the manner required under subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If an adult foster care facility determines it necessary to employ or independently contract with an individual before receiving the results of the individual's criminal history check or criminal history record information required under this section, the adult foster care facility may conditionally employ the individual if all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The adult foster care facility requests the criminal history check or criminal history record information required under this section, upon conditionally employing the individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The individual signs a written statement indicating all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) That he or she has not been convicted of 1 or more of the crimes that are described in subsection (1)(a) to (g) within the applicable time period prescribed by subsection (1)(a) to (g).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) That he or she is not the subject of an order or disposition described in subsection (1)(h).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) That he or she has not been the subject of a substantiated finding as described in subsection (1)(i).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The individual agrees that, if the information in the criminal history check conducted under this section does not confirm the individual's statement under subparagraphs (i) to (iii), his or her employment will be terminated by the adult foster care facility as required under subsection (1) unless and until the individual can prove that the information is incorrect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) That he or she understands the conditions described in subparagraphs (i) to (iv) that result in the termination of his or her employment and that those conditions are good cause for termination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the adult foster care facility does not permit the individual to have regular direct access to or provide direct services to residents in the adult foster care facility without supervision until the criminal history check or criminal history record information is obtained and the individual is eligible for that employment. If required under this subdivision, the adult foster care facility shall provide on-site supervision of an individual in the facility on a conditional basis under this subsection by an individual who has undergone a criminal history check conducted in compliance with this section. An adult foster care facility may permit an individual in the facility on a conditional basis under this subsection to have regular direct access to or provide direct services to residents in the adult foster care facility without supervision if all of the following conditions are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The adult foster care facility, at its own expense and before the individual has direct access to or provides direct services to residents of the facility, conducts a search of public records on that individual through the internet criminal history access tool maintained by the department of state police and the results of that search do not uncover any information that would indicate that the individual is not eligible to have regular direct access to or provide direct services to residents under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Before the individual has direct access to or provides direct services to residents of the adult foster care facility, the individual signs a statement in writing that he or she has resided in this state without interruption for at least the immediately preceding 12-month period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If applicable, the individual provides to the department of state police a set of fingerprints on or before the expiration of 10 business days following the date the individual was conditionally employed under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The department shall develop and distribute the model form for the statements required under subsection (6)(b) and (c). The department shall make the model form available to adult foster care facilities upon request at no charge.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If an individual is conditionally employed under subsection (6), and the information under subsection (3) or report under subsection (4) or (5), if applicable, does not confirm the individual's statement under subsection (6)(b)(i) to (iii), the adult foster care facility shall terminate the individual's employment as required by subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An individual who knowingly provides false information regarding his or her identity, criminal convictions, or substantiated findings on a statement described in subsection (6)(b)(i) to (iii) is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $500.00, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) An adult foster care facility or staffing agency shall use criminal history record information obtained under subsection (3), (4), or (5) only for the purpose of evaluating an individual's qualifications for employment in the position for which he or she has applied and for the purposes of subsections (6) and (8). An adult foster care facility or staffing agency or an employee of the adult foster care facility or staffing agency shall not disclose criminal history record information obtained under this section to a person who is not directly involved in evaluating the individual's qualifications for employment or independent contract. An individual who knowingly uses or disseminates the criminal history record information obtained under subsection (3), (4), or (5) in violation of this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $1,000.00, or both. Except for a knowing or intentional release of false information, an adult foster care facility or staffing agency has no liability in connection with a criminal history check conducted in compliance with this section or the release of criminal history record information under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Upon consent of an individual as required in subsection (3) and upon request from an adult foster care facility or staffing agency that has made a good-faith offer of employment or an independent contract to the individual, the relevant licensing or regulatory department shall review the criminal history record information, if any, and notify the requesting adult foster care facility or staffing agency of the information in the manner prescribed in subsection (4) or (5). Until the Federal Bureau of Investigation implements an automatic notification system similar to the system required of the state police under subsection (14) and federal regulations allow the federal criminal record to be used for subsequent authorized uses, as determined in an order issued by the department, an adult foster care facility or staffing agency may rely on the criminal history record information provided by the relevant licensing or regulatory department under this subsection and a request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to make a subsequent determination of the existence of any national criminal history pertaining to the individual is not necessary if all of the following requirements are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The criminal history check was conducted during the immediately preceding 24-month period. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The individual has been continuously employed by an adult foster care facility, mental health facility, or covered health facility, or the staffing agency since the criminal history check was conducted in compliance with this section or meets the continuous employment requirement of this subdivision other than being on layoff status for less than 1 year from an adult foster care facility, mental health facility, or covered health facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The individual can provide evidence acceptable to the relevant licensing or regulatory department that he or she has been a resident of this state for the immediately preceding 12-month period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) As a condition of continued employment, each employee or independent contractor shall do both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Agree in writing to report to the adult foster care facility or staffing agency immediately upon being arraigned on 1 or more of the criminal offenses listed in subsection (1)(a) to (g), upon being convicted of 1 or more of the criminal offenses listed in subsection (1)(a) to (g), upon becoming the subject of an order or disposition described under subsection (1)(h), and upon becoming the subject of a substantiated finding described under subsection (1)(i). Reporting of an arraignment under this subdivision is not cause for termination or denial of employment.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 10.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The department of social services may provide for home repairs to be performed either by seeking competitive bids on individual dwellings or by entering into contractual arrangements involving more than 1 dwelling.

</P>
<P>Sec. 11.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Program utilities shall provide shutoff protection to all dwellings occupied by assisted households which receive weatherization measures in accordance with this act. The shutoff protection shall begin with the department of social services' authorization, pursuant to section 7, of weatherization measures, and will continue in accordance with this section unless the department of social services notifies the program utility that it will not authorize the necessary work because the weatherization would not be cost effective. Shutoff protection for dwellings which receive weatherization measures in accordance with this act shall continue at least until the end of the first full fiscal year following the fiscal year during which the weatherization measures were completed. If an assisted household whose annual consumption exceeds 130% of the annual consumption caps specified in section 8 of the Michigan low income heating assistance and shut-off protection act, or the dollar equivalent in other heating fuels, has not been weatherized within the period required by section 5, the department of social services and the department of labor shall report to the legislative oversight committee created in section 13 on the reasons for such failure.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the dwelling is weatherized in accordance with this act and the consumption of the dwelling remains at the level projected in the home energy analysis, the dwelling will continue to receive shutoff protection for as long as an assisted household resides in the dwelling provided an assisted household continues to pay to the program utility the amount available for heat through the appropriate public assistance program, and the department of social services guarantees payment to the program utility for the difference between the level projected in the home energy analysis and the amounts available in the appropriate public assistance program.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The department of social services shall, after the first full fiscal year following the completion of the authorized services, or sooner, if, in the department's estimation, the consumption of a dwelling remains at unexpectedly high levels, review and investigate the case of any assisted household consumption which exceeds the calculated consumption level. The department of social services shall determine the cause of the excess energy consumption.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If, after review and investigation conducted pursuant to subsection (3), the department of social services concludes that reasonable and prudent action by the assisted household will eliminate the excess energy consumption, the department of social services shall advise the assisted household of measures to be taken to reduce excess consumption. If the assisted household does not comply with the department of social services' suggested corrections, and the household's actual consumption exceeds the calculated consumption level, the household shall not be entitled to shutoff protection for the remainder of the state fiscal year and for any subsequent state fiscal year until the assisted household complies with the suggested corrections.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If, after a review and investigation conducted pursuant to subsection (3), the department of social services concludes that the excess consumption cannot be remedied by the assisted household, the department of social services shall use available resources and means to reduce the excess consumption.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If an assisted household which is receiving shutoff protection vacates the dwelling which was weatherized in accordance with this act, the shutoff protection shall cease for that dwelling unless the new occupants are general assistance or aid to families with dependent children recipients who qualify for payments in accordance with subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If an emergency needs program recipient, other than a recipient of general assistance or aid to families with dependent children administered under the social welfare act, Act No. 280 of the Public Acts of 1939, being sections 400.1 to 400.121 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, takes up residence in a dwelling that has been weatherized under this program and the occupancy was within 2 years of the date of weatherization, and was immediately after an aid to dependent children or general assistance recipient moved out, the emergency needs recipient will, for purposes of this act, be treated in the same manner as an aid to dependent children or general assistance recipient in all respects by both the department of social services and the program utility.</DIV>
