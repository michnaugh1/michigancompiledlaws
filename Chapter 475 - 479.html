Upon request of the shipper, the motor carrier of household goods shall relinquish possession of the shipment upon payment of not more than 110% of the estimated charges and shall defer a demand for payment of the balance of any remaining charges for a period of 30 days after the date of delivery. This subsection does not apply to a shipment that is delivered to a warehouse for storage at the request of a shipper.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) In addition to the license fees or taxes otherwise imposed upon motor carriers, the commission shall assess against and collect from each motor carrier for the administration of this act an annual fee of $100.00 for each self-propelled intrastate motor vehicle operated by or on behalf of the motor carrier, except as otherwise provided in this subsection. A motor carrier shall pay a fee of only $50.00 for each self-propelled intrastate motor vehicle operated by or on behalf of the motor carrier if the motor carrier begins operation of the vehicle after June 30 and has not previously paid a fee under this subsection for that vehicle. After payment of the $100.00 annual fee for an intrastate motor vehicle, or the $50.00 fee paid for a vehicle operated after June 30, or the $50.00 fee paid for a vehicle used for the transportation of household goods if a motor carrier seeks to begin operating a self-propelled intrastate motor vehicle in place of another motor vehicle not leased to the motor carrier by an owner operator for which a fee was paid and surrenders the identification allocated to the motor vehicle by the commission, accompanied by a fee of $10.00, the commission shall issue a replacement identification. If the owner operator replaces a vehicle while it is still leased to the same motor carrier to whom it was leased when the identification was issued, the replacement identification fee is $10.00. For each truck or tractor used exclusively for the transportation of household goods as defined by the commission or a vehicle used for intrastate nonconsensual towing operations by a UCR motor carrier subject to the requirements of section 4305 of the federal unified carrier registration act of 2005, 49 USC 14504a, the annual fee is $50.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The commission shall revoke the intrastate authority of a UCR carrier that fails to renew its annual UCR registration by January 1.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The commission may issue a temporary 72-hour permit for the operation of a vehicle subject to rules and conditions of the commission at a fee of $10.00, which is in place of any other fee otherwise required under this section. The commission shall reserve the authority to deny or curtail the use of a temporary permit authorized by this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) This section applies to all matters before the commission for which the commission has jurisdiction under article III. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A motor carrier of household goods shall not change any general rate or change any rate, fare, charge, or classification, or any rule or practice affecting the rate, fare, charge, or classification, or the value of the service thereunder, specified in any effective tariff of any motor carrier for hire, unless it has given 30 days' notice, or 45 days' notice in a general rate increase or reduction, to the commission and to the public, filed and posted as provided in section 6 of article III except that changes in rates, fares, charges, or classifications or the value of service thereunder made under section 7a of article III shall be made on 10 days' notice. The notice shall plainly state the change proposed to be made and the time when the change will take effect. The commission may, in its discretion and after good cause shown, allow changes upon less time than the notice specified in this subsection or modify the requirements in this section regarding publishing, posting, and filing of tariffs, either in particular instances or by general order applicable to special or peculiar circumstances or conditions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Upon the filing with the commission by any motor carrier of household goods of any tariff or supplement showing a change in rates, fares, charges, or classification, or a rule or practice affecting the rate, fare, charge, or classification, or the value of the service thereunder, the commission, upon notice to the motor carrier of household goods, may postpone the date when the new rate, fare, charge, classification, rule, or practice becomes effective to a time not to exceed 60 days to give the commission opportunity to investigate the reasonableness of the proposed rate, fare, charge, classification, rule, or practice. The commission may proceed with an investigation upon at least 10 days' notice to the motor carrier of household goods as to the reasonableness of the rate, fare, charge, classification, rule, or practice. The investigation takes precedence over all matters of a different nature pending before the commission under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except in an emergency satisfactorily shown to the commission, the commission shall not consider a petition for suspension unless the petition was filed at least 10 days before the effective date of the proposed change in rate, charge, fare, classification, rule, or practice. The petition or order shall be definite and specific and a copy shall be served upon all motor carriers of household goods affected at the time of filing or issuance. However, service upon an agent who has issued and filed a tariff or schedule on behalf of a motor carrier of household goods shall be considered due and sufficient service upon the motor carrier of household goods. The petition or order must recite the specific facts relied upon to establish that failure to postpone will work a special hardship on the petitioner that cannot otherwise be avoided.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) At a hearing involving a change in a rate, fare, charge, classification, rule, or practice, the burden of proof is on the motor carrier of household goods to show that the proposed changed rate, fare, charge, classification, rule, or practice is just and reasonable.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Each motor carrier of household goods that is a party to an agreement described in this section shall file with the commission a statement that specifies its name, its mailing address, and the telephone number of its main office; the names and addresses of each of its affiliates; the names, addresses, and affiliates of each of its officers and directors; and the names, addresses, and affiliates of each person, who together with an affiliate owning or controlling any debt, equity, or security interest in it has a value of at least $100.00.

The notice shall contain the name of the organization, its address, its telephone number, a meeting docket or agenda, and the place, date, and time of the meeting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Minutes of a meeting described in subsection (5) shall be kept by the organization and made available to the general public and shall be submitted to the commission on or before the eighth working day after the meeting. Minutes of other meetings shall be maintained by the organization for 1 year after the meeting. Minutes of a meeting described in subsection (5) shall contain the date, time, and place of meeting; members present; members absent; and decisions taken.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The commission shall not approve under this section any agreement that establishes a procedure for the determination of any matter through joint consideration unless it finds that under the agreement each party has the free and unrestrained right to take independent action after a determination is arrived at through the procedure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The commission, upon complaint by a shipper or receiver of freight transported under jointly considered and initiated rates and charges or by a motor carrier of household goods that is party to an agreement approved by the commission under this section, may investigate and determine whether an agreement previously approved by it under this section has been violated in a manner contrary to the transportation policy set forth in section 2 of article I. After investigation, the commission shall, by order, direct the parties to the agreement to cease and desist from violations of that agreement and this section if it finds the action necessary to assure conformity with the transportation policy. The effective date of a cease and desist order shall be postponed for a period that the commission determines to be reasonably necessary to avoid undue hardships. A commission decision issued after December 28, 1982 that has terminated a previously approved agreement for reasons or on terms inconsistent with this section shall be null and void.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The commission shall not enter an order under this section unless interested parties have been afforded reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A motor carrier of household goods subject to this act shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it receives for transportation under this article. That carrier, as well as any other motor carrier of household goods that delivers the property subject to this act, is liable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading. The liability imposed under this subsection is for the actual loss or injury to the property caused by the carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in this state and applies to property reconsigned or diverted by a tariff under this act. Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect the liability of the carrier. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A motor carrier of household goods may not provide, by rule, contract, or otherwise, a period of less than 3 months for filing a claim against it under this section and a period of less than 2 years for bringing a civil action against it under this section. The period for bringing a civil action is computed from the date the carrier gives a claimant written notice that the carrier has disallowed any part of the claim specified in the notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For purposes of this subsection, both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An offer of compromise is not a disallowance of any part of the claim unless the carrier, in writing, informs the claimant that the part of the claim is disallowed and provides reasons for the disallowance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Communications received from a carrier's insurer are not a disallowance of any part of the claim unless the insurer, in writing, informs the claimant that the part of the claim is disallowed, provides reason for the disallowance, and informs the claimant that the insurer is acting on behalf of the carrier.</div>

A cab card shall be carried in the vehicle for which it was issued. A decal shall be attached to a conspicuous location on the vehicle for which it was issued as directed by the commission.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A certificate granted to an intrastate-only motor carrier of general commodities or a motor carrier of household goods terminates on December 31 of the calendar year during which the certificate was issued. An intrastate-only motor carrier of general commodities or motor carrier of household goods shall apply for the renewal of its certificate no earlier than October 1 and no later than December 1 of the year in which its current certificate expires. A certificate holder that does not apply by December 1 shall be assessed a penalty of $50.00 per month for each month or partial month that the application is late. The renewal application shall be accompanied with the required fees, proof of insurance, and all other things required to be filed with the commission by law or by the rules and orders of the commission. If the commission determines that a renewal application received before December 1 is incomplete, the commission shall send a notice of noncompliance to the motor carrier. The commission shall not assess the late fee described in this subsection against a motor carrier that complies with the terms of the notice of noncompliance by December 31 of the year in which the application is required to be made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The certificate of an intrastate-only motor carrier of general commodities or motor carrier of household goods who is delinquent in providing required documents or payment of the fees required by this act at the time of renewal of the certificate shall be canceled and terminated on and after January 1 of the year for which application should have been made under this section. Upon expiration, an intrastate-only motor carrier of general commodities is prohibited from operating any of its vehicles and a motor carrier of household goods is prohibited from operating any vehicle to transport household goods or engage in any other service subject to renewal of the certificate, upon or over the highways of this state. All privileges granted under an expiring certificate cease. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The commission shall give an applicant whose certificate was canceled or terminated for failure to renew on January 1 of the year for which an application should have been made until December 31 to comply with the renewal requirements of subsection (1). Upon receipt of a properly completed application, fee, proof of insurance, and a satisfactory safety review, the commission shall grant a 60-day temporary authority to an intrastate-only motor carrier of general commodities or a motor carrier of household goods that applies for renewal of a certificate that has been expired for less than 1 year. An intrastate-only motor carrier of general commodities or a motor carrier of household goods that does not comply with the renewal requirements of this section before January 1 of the next renewal year for which it should have applied for renewal shall apply for an original certificate of authority, and shall pay the fee for an original certificate of authority and any applicable late fees for the previous year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions in this act voiding a certificate for cause are self-executing and do not require any affirmative act on the part of the commission, and the commission shall not extend the privilege or allow an intrastate-only motor carrier of general commodities or a motor carrier of household goods to engage in any operation over the public highway. The revocation of a certificate does not release a motor carrier from liability for accrued fees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Upon full compliance with the requirements of this act for the filing of the application, the commission shall issue a certificate for the succeeding calendar year, subject to all the provisions of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The holder of a certificate under this act may add equipment at any time, but when adding equipment subject to a privilege fee prescribed by this act, the holder shall file an application in the form required by the commission and pay for each unit of equipment added, the fee required in section 2 of article IV. If the holder of a certificate other than a certificate that authorizes the transportation of household goods while those household goods are being transported, by lease, contract, or any arrangement other than outright purchase, augments his or her equipment, the lease, contract, or arrangement shall be in writing and shall vest in the holder exclusive possession and control of the vehicle under the lease or arrangement for the entire term of the lease or arrangement. Any operation of the vehicle shall be conducted under the exclusive supervision, direction, and control of the holder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Using a form prescribed by the commission, a certified motor carrier may withdraw equipment from service at any time without refund by surrendering to the commission the identification allocated to the unit at the time it was certificated.</div>

Only the commission, on its motion, may bring a complaint against a motor carrier of household goods for predatory rates, practices, or rules under section 6(1) of article III. Before investigating a complaint, the commission shall give the motor carrier and the complainants at least 10 days' notice of the time and place when and where the matters will be considered and determined, and the parties are entitled to be heard and shall have process to enforce the attendance of witnesses. If, upon investigation of a motor carrier of household goods, any matters complained of are found to be in violation of this act, the commission shall determine and by order fix the practice, service, or charges and shall order a substitute practice, service, or charge that conform to this act and the rules of the commission applicable to the motor carrier of household goods. The order shall further direct the parties complained of to cease and desist from the violation and conform to the terms of the order.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the commission believes that this act or any rule or order of the commission made under this act has been or is being violated, or that any charges have been made or collected or service performed in violation of this act or any rule or order of the commission made under this act, and that an investigation relating to the violation should be made, the commission may on its own motion or on the application of anyone investigate the suspected violation. Before making the investigation, the commission shall present to the parties alleged to be guilty of the violations a written statement setting forth the matters to be investigated. After the commission has presented the written statement described in this subsection, on 10 days' notice to the parties of the time and place of the investigation, the commission may investigate the matters complained of and enter orders as provided for an investigation upon complaint under subsection (1). An investigation, inquiry, or hearing that the commission has power to undertake or to hold may be undertaken or held by or before any commissioner or any employee of the commission when directed by the commission or its chairperson.
