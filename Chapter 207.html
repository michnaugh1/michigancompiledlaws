</P>
<P>Sec. 9.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Not later than May 15 in each year, the state board of assessors shall prepare an assessment roll upon which they shall set forth the true cash value and taxable value on the immediately preceding December 31 of all the property of the companies subject to taxation under this act. A determination of true cash value and taxable value is not final until reviewed as provided in this act. For the purpose of arriving at the true cash value and taxable value of the property on the assessment roll, the state board of assessors may personally inspect the property assessed, may consider the reports filed under this act or reports and returns filed in the office of any officer of this state or in the office of any other governmental agency, and any other evidence or information obtained or possessed by the state board of assessors.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In determining the true cash value and taxable value of the property of a railroad, union station, and depot company that owns, leases, operates, or uses lines partly within or partly outside of this state, the state board of assessors shall consider the proportion of the number of miles of all track controlled or used by that company within this state to the entire mileage of all track controlled or used by that company both within and outside of this state. The state board of assessors shall also consider any other uniform factors that reflect a fair allocation of value to this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   For tax years that begin before January 1, 2006, in determining the true cash value and taxable value of the property of a telegraph company or telephone company that owns, leases, operates, or uses lines partly within and partly outside of this state, the state board of assessors shall only consider the proportion of the number of miles of telegraph or telephone lines controlled or used by that company within this state to the entire mileage of telegraph or telephone lines controlled or used by that company both within and outside of this state. The state board of assessors shall also consider any other uniform factors that reflect a fair allocation of value to this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In determining the true cash value and taxable value of the property of an express company, the state board of assessors shall determine the actual value of the entire amount of the capital stock and bonded indebtedness of that express company. From that amount, the state board of assessors shall determine and deduct the actual value of all real property owned by that express company, and the actual value of all personal property owned by that express company that is not used in the express business of that express company. The state board of assessors shall then divide the remaining amount by the total number of miles, as determined by the state board of assessors, of railroad, stage, water, and other routes over which the company did business to obtain the value per mile. The state board of assessors shall then multiply the value per mile by the total number of miles of the routes within this state, as determined by the state board of assessors. The state board of assessors shall then add to the product of that calculation the value of all real estate owned by that express company in this state, as determined by the state board of assessors. The sum of this calculation is the actual value of the property of that express company subject to assessment and taxation in this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the state board of assessors determines that the ocean routes of a company are so different in character from its other routes that the mileage basis of apportionment of the value of the entire property to be apportioned in this state would be unfair if the full mileage of the ocean routes were included, the state board of assessors may make an allowance for that company's ocean routes to bring those ocean routes to parity with that company's other routes. In making this determination, the state board of assessors shall consider the relative mileage values and earning capacities of the ocean routes and the other routes and shall require special reports of the character, mileage, earnings, and value of the ocean routes. The state board of assessors may exclude from its determination of aggregate mileage any ocean routes on which the express company fails to furnish the requisite reports, but no further penalty shall be imposed for the failure to report the mileage of ocean routes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If a company claims in writing that the mileage basis of apportionment of the value of the entire property to be attributed to this state is unfair, the state board of assessors shall make the apportionment that in its judgment is fair. In making that apportionment, the state board of assessors shall consider the mileage within and outside of this state, making any necessary allowance for ocean mileage as provided in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   In determining the true cash value and taxable value of the property in this state of car loaning, stock car, refrigerator, fast freight lines, and other car companies, and other companies owning, leasing, running, or operating cars subject to taxation under this act, the state board of assessors shall consider the proportion of the aggregate car mileage made or run by the entire number of cars owned or operated by a company to the car mileage made or run by the entire number of cars owned or operated by that company within this state.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 13.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The state board of assessors, from the information contained in the reports provided for in section 12, shall determine for the year in which the reports are required to be made the average rate of taxation levied on other commercial, industrial, and utility property on which ad valorem taxes are assessed for state, county, township, school, and municipal purposes, and enter the determination in its records, together with the method by which the average rate of taxation was determined. In determining the average rate of taxation for taxes levied under this act before January 1, 1996, the state board of assessors shall divide the state equalized value as set by the state board of equalization for the previous year into the total ad valorem taxes as reported by each director of a county tax or equalization department as provided in section 12. In determining the average rate of taxation for taxes levied under this act after December 31, 1995, the state board of assessors shall divide the state taxable value for the previous year into the total ad valorem taxes as reported by each director of a county tax or equalization department as provided in section 12. In determining the average rate of taxation for 1994, ad valorem taxes levied for the year in which the reports are required by a local school district for school operating purposes as defined in section 1211 of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1211, shall be excluded from the calculation required by this section and the state board of assessors shall add to the tax rate calculated under this section after the exclusion required by this sentence, the number of mills levied under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, plus the statewide average number of mills levied in 1994 by local school districts for school operating purposes under the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1 to 380.1852. If the state board of assessors is unable to determine the average rate of taxation for 1994 before June 1, 1994, the state board of assessors shall determine a preliminary average rate of taxation that shall be used to complete the 1994 tax roll under section 14. However, before June 1, 1995, the state board of assessors shall determine and certify the average rate of taxation for 1994 and prepare a supplemental 1994 tax roll using the 1994 assessed valuations for the purpose of levying a supplemental tax or making a refund. The supplemental tax is due and payable and the refund, if any, is due July 1, 1995 without interest. If the supplemental tax is paid after August 1, 1995, the tax is payable with interest due at the rate of 1% per month or portion of a month calculated from January 15, 1995 to the date of payment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A railroad company is allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this act for the tax year in an amount equal to 25% of the amount expended for the maintenance or improvement of rights of way, including those items, except depreciation, in the official maintenance-of-way and capital track accounts of the railroad company in this state during the calendar year immediately preceding the tax year but not to exceed the total liability for the tax under this act. The manner of applying for the credit and the proof of expenditures required shall be prescribed by the state board of assessors.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A railroad company that claims a credit under this section is required to file an annual report with the state board of assessors that shall include detailed data of right of way work conducted in this state during the past calendar year. The state board of assessors shall transmit a copy of the report to the chairperson of the senate finance committee and the house taxation committee. This report submitted to the state board of assessors shall include the number of notices of violation from railway inspectors by railroad section, and shall include a detailed account of the location and the nature of the work. The location of the work shall be defined by the railroad section or mile posts surrounding the work area plus the county, city, or township in which the work was performed. This report shall include a separation of costs by labor and materials on each project. The report also shall include an itemized account of what work was done. This account shall be itemized by the following categories:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Miles of track laid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Tons of new ballast installed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Number of ties installed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Miles of tracks surfaced.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Signals installed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Under drainage work done.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The railroad companies, in order to qualify for the full 25% credit under this act, must demonstrate to the state board of assessors that the highest priority of expenditures for the maintenance or improvement of rights of way has been given to rail lines that handle hazardous materials, especially those that are located in urban or residential areas. A railroad company that claims a credit under this section is required to file an annual report with the state board of assessors that shall include detailed data on the tonnages of hazardous materials handled in relation to tonnages of other traffic handled over the rail line for which a tax credit is being applied.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A railroad company utilizing the property tax credit provisions of this act shall grant to another railroad company, upon application by the latter, trackage rights over its line for trains, providing that the train operations do not interfere with the movement of Michigan freight using the same trackage, if operations can be accomplished safely in the opinion of the grantor and if trackage arrangements and train operations are approved by the interstate commerce commission. The grantee shall pay the grantor reasonable charges agreed to between the 2 parties if the charges and terms of the agreement between the 2 parties are not in violation of the antitrust provisions of federal laws. </DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 14.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The state board of assessors shall tax the property of the companies subject to taxation under this act based upon the taxable value of the property determined by the state board of assessors and at the rate determined by the state board of assessors. The amount of tax to be paid by each company assessed shall be extended on the assessment roll, opposite the description of that company's property. After the tax roll is completed, and before June 20 in each year, the state board of assessors shall attach to the tax roll a certificate signed by the members of the state board of assessors, or a majority of the members of the state board of assessors, that states "We do hereby certify that we have set down in the above assessment roll all of the property of railroad companies, express companies, union station and depot companies, telegraph and telephone companies, car loaning, stock car, refrigerator, fast freight line, and other car companies, and other companies owning, leasing, running, or operating cars, and sleeping car companies liable to be taxed in this state, according to our best information, and that we have determined the true cash value and taxable value of that property, and that we have assessed the taxes on that property at the average rate of taxes for state, county, township, school, municipal, and other purposes levied through this state during the preceding year as determined by us.".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The tax roll shall be delivered to the commissioner of revenue, who shall immediately notify by registered mail each company taxed to pay the taxes extended on the tax roll to the state treasurer. The taxes assessed are payable on July 1 following the assessment and levy of those taxes, and are in lieu of all ad valorem taxes for state and local purposes, not including special assessments on property particularly benefited made in any county, city, village, or township. All taxes not paid before August 1 in the year in which those taxes are payable shall bear interest from August 1 at the rate of 1% per month or fraction of a month. However, if 1/2 of the amount of the taxes due are paid before August 1, the remaining taxes due may be paid before the immediately succeeding December 1 without interest, otherwise the taxes unpaid on August 1 shall bear interest as provided in this section. The taxes levied are a debt of the company assessed to the state and are a lien on all of the property of that company, real, personal, and mixed. A lien under this section takes precedence over all demands, judgments, assignments by warranty deed or otherwise, or decrees against the company assessed. A lien and debt under this section may be enforced by the seizure or sale of the property assessed or any portion of the property assessed necessary to satisfy the lien and debt. The state board of assessors shall, upon the completion of the tax roll and the correction of the tax roll as provided in this act, annex to the tax roll a warrant, signed by the board or a majority of the state board of assessors, commanding the commissioner of revenue to collect the taxes due under this act. The warrant shall authorize and command the commissioner of revenue, in case any corporation, company, or person named in the tax roll does not pay the tax due under this act, to levy the tax due by distress and sale of the property of that corporation, company, or person or any portion of that property necessary to raise sufficient money to satisfy the tax due and the expense of the sale, after giving the corporation, company, or person notice of the sale as provided by law for the sale of property seized for taxes and offered for sale. However, the commissioner may bring an action in the name of the people of this state in any court of competent jurisdiction in this state, or in any other state, to enforce the lien and after obtaining a judgment or decree, the judgment or decree may be collected by execution, levy, and sale.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A person required to be licensed by this act shall not act as a motor carrier in this state unless the person is the holder of an unrevoked license issued by the department or is the holder of an unrevoked license issued under the international fuel tax agreement by this state or another member jurisdiction of the international fuel tax agreement. To procure a license, a motor carrier shall file with the department a verified application upon a form prescribed and to be furnished by the department. The application shall contain the name and address of the motor carrier and, if a partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, the names and addresses of the persons constituting the firm, partnership, association, joint stock company, limited liability company, syndicate, or corporation, the name of its resident agent, the location of its predominant place of business, both within and outside of this state, and other pertinent information the department may require.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The department shall issue to each motor carrier 1 license per person and 2 decals for each qualified commercial motor vehicle. A decal shall be affixed respectively to the right-hand side and left-hand side of the cab of every qualified commercial motor vehicle while it is being operated in this state by each person licensed under this act. A copy of the license shall be carried in each cab while it is being operated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For cause, a motor carrier may be required to file with the department a surety bond payable to this state, upon which the applicant is the obligor, in the sum of 3 times the highest estimated quarterly tax, or $1,000.00, whichever is greater. This surety bond shall be conditioned upon the applicant complying with this act and with the rules promulgated under this act, promptly filing true reports, and paying the taxes, interest, and penalties required by this act. Each surety bond shall be approved as to amount and sureties by the department. The department may accept cash or securities instead of a surety bond.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The commissioner may waive the bond requirement for a motor carrier exempt from the reporting requirements of section 2 when the collection of taxes would not be impaired by lack of security of a bond required by this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The license and decals are not assignable or transferable to another person and are valid only for the person in whose name they are issued. However, upon application to the department, a motor carrier, upon the sale, conveyance, disposal, or replacement of a qualified commercial motor vehicle, may transfer the license and decals for that qualified commercial motor vehicle to another qualified commercial motor vehicle of the motor carrier that is required to be licensed under this act. The department shall issue replacement decals for the newly licensed qualified commercial motor vehicle that authorizes the holder of the qualified commercial motor vehicle license to use and consume motor fuel or alternative fuel in the qualified commercial motor vehicle upon the public roads or highways of this state until the original license would have expired. The department may require the payment of a fee to cover the administrative costs of issuing a replacement license or decals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Upon filing of the application and upon posting of any bond as required, the department shall issue to the applicant a license and decals that authorize the holder to operate qualified commercial motor vehicles using and consuming motor fuels or alternative fuels upon the public roads or highways of this state until January 1 of the year following the date of issuance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a licensee ceases to engage in business within this state, the licensee shall notify the department in writing within 15 days after discontinuance.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Every qualified commercial motor vehicle leased to a motor carrier is subject to this act to the same extent and in the same manner as a qualified commercial motor vehicle owned by a motor carrier.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A lessor of qualified commercial motor vehicles may be considered a motor carrier with respect to qualified commercial motor vehicles leased to others, if the lessor supplies or pays for the motor fuel or alternative fuel consumed by the vehicles or bills rental or other charges calculated to include the cost of motor fuel or alternative fuel. A lessee motor carrier may exclude a qualified commercial motor vehicle leased from others from the reports and liabilities required by this act if that qualified commercial motor vehicle has been leased from a lessor who is a motor carrier under this act and the lease agreement provides for the lessor to pay the cost of motor fuel or alternative fuel and motor fuel or alternative fuel taxes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Upon application by a licensed motor carrier, the department may authorize a licensed motor carrier leasing qualified commercial motor vehicles from 2 or more lessors to file consolidated reports for these lessors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) This section governs the primary liability under this act of lessors and lessees of qualified commercial motor vehicles. For tax liabilities incurred before April 1, 2005, if a lessor or lessee primarily liable fails, in whole or in part, to discharge his or her liability, the failing party and the other lessor or lessee party to the transaction are jointly and severally responsible and liable for compliance with this act and for the payment of tax due. However, the aggregate of taxes collected from a lessor and lessee by this state under this act shall not exceed the total amount of taxes due and costs and penalties imposed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) For tax liabilities arising after April 1, 2005, if a lease agreement identifies a party responsible for the payment of taxes, the nonresponsible party under the lease shall obtain a copy of the responsible party's valid international fuel tax agreement registration and keep the copy on file. If the nonresponsible party does not obtain a copy of the responsible party's valid international fuel tax agreement registration and the responsible party fails in whole or in part to discharge his or her liability, then the responsible and nonresponsible parties are jointly and severally responsible and liable for compliance with this act and payment of tax due. If the lease agreement does not identify the party responsible for payment of fuel taxes under this act, then both parties are jointly and severally responsible and liable for compliance with this act and payment of tax due. However, the aggregate of taxes collected from a lessor and lessee by this state under this act shall not exceed the total amount of taxes due and costs and penalties imposed. If the nonresponsible party under the lease maintains a copy of the responsible party's valid international fuel tax agreement registration on file, the nonresponsible party has no responsibility or liability for compliance with this act or payment of any taxes, costs, or penalties due under this act relating to the motor fuel or alternative fuel consumed under the lease.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) In the case of construction on vacant noncontiguous land, property that is or will be used as industrial property that is or is to be acquired, constructed, transferred, or installed for the purpose of being substituted for obsolete industrial property if the obsolete industrial property is situated in a plant rehabilitation district in the same city, village, or township as the land on which the facility is or is to be constructed and includes the obsolete industrial property itself until the time as the substituted facility is completed.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) "Industrial property" means land improvements, buildings, structures, and other real property, and machinery, equipment, furniture, and fixtures or any part or accessory whether completed or in the process of construction comprising an integrated whole, the primary purpose and use of which is the engaging in a high-technology activity, operation of a strategic response center, operation of a motorsports entertainment complex, operation of a logistical optimization center, operation of qualified commercial activity, operation of a major distribution and logistics facility, the manufacture of goods or materials, creation or synthesis of biodiesel fuel, or the processing of goods and materials by physical or chemical change; property acquired, constructed, altered, or installed due to the passage of proposal A in 1976; the operation of a hydro-electric dam by a private company other than a public utility; or agricultural processing facilities.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The legislative body of the local governmental unit, in its resolution approving an application, shall set forth a finding and determination that the granting of the industrial facilities exemption certificate, considered together with the aggregate amount of industrial facilities exemption certificates previously granted and currently in force, shall not have the effect of substantially impeding the operation of the local governmental unit or impairing the financial soundness of a taxing unit that levies an ad valorem property tax in the local governmental unit in which the facility is located or to be located. If the state equalized valuation of property proposed to be exempt pursuant to an application under consideration, considered together with the aggregate state equalized valuation of property exempt under certificates previously granted and currently in force, exceeds 5% of the state equalized valuation of the local governmental unit, the commission, with the approval of the state treasurer, shall make a separate finding and shall include a statement in the order approving the industrial facilities exemption certificate that exceeding that amount shall not have the effect of substantially impeding the operation of the local governmental unit or impairing the financial soundness of an affected taxing unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except for an application for a speculative building, which is governed by subsection (4), the legislative body of the local governmental unit shall not approve an application and the commission shall not grant an industrial facilities exemption certificate unless the applicant complies with all of the following requirements:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The commencement of the restoration, replacement, or construction of the facility occurred not earlier than 12 months before the filing of the application for the industrial facilities exemption certificate. If the application is not filed within the 12-month period, the application may be filed within the succeeding 12-month period and the industrial facilities exemption certificate shall in this case expire 1 year earlier than it would have expired if the application had been timely filed. This subdivision does not apply for applications filed with the local governmental unit after December 31, 1983.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For applications made after December 31, 1983, the proposed facility shall be located within a plant rehabilitation district or industrial development district that was duly established in a local governmental unit eligible under this act to establish a district and that was established upon a request filed or by the local governmental unit's own initiative taken before the commencement of the restoration, replacement, or construction of the facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For applications made after December 31, 1983, the commencement of the restoration, replacement, or construction of the facility occurred not earlier than 6 months before the filing of the application for the industrial facilities exemption certificate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The application relates to a construction, restoration, or replacement program that when completed constitutes a new or replacement facility within the meaning of this act and that shall be situated within a plant rehabilitation district or industrial development district duly established in a local governmental unit eligible under this act to establish the district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Completion of the facility is calculated to, and will at the time of issuance of the certificate have the reasonable likelihood to create employment, retain employment, prevent a loss of employment, or produce energy in the community in which the facility is situated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Completion of the facility does not constitute merely the addition of machinery and equipment for the purpose of increasing productive capacity but rather is primarily for the purpose and will primarily have the effect of restoration, replacement, or updating the technology of obsolete industrial property. An increase in productive capacity, even though significant, is not an impediment to the issuance of an industrial facilities exemption certificate if other criteria in this section and act are met.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in subsections (6) and (7), there is levied upon every owner of a speculative building, a new facility, or a replacement facility to which an industrial facilities exemption certificate is issued a specific tax to be known as the industrial facility tax and an administrative fee calculated in the same manner and at the same rate that the local tax collecting unit imposes on ad valorem taxes collected under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The industrial facility tax and administrative fee are to be paid annually, at the same times, in the same installments, and to the same officer or officers as taxes and administrative fees, if any, imposed under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, are payable. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the officer or officers shall disburse the industrial facility tax payments received each year to and among the state, cities, townships, villages, school districts, counties, and authorities, at the same times and in the same proportions as required by law for the disbursement of taxes collected under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as provided by subsections (4) and (5), for an intermediate school district receiving state aid under section 56, 62, or 81 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1656, 388.1662, and 388.1681, of the amount that would otherwise be disbursed to or retained by the intermediate school district, all or a portion, to be determined on the basis of the tax rates being utilized to compute the amount of the state school aid, shall be paid instead to the state treasury to the credit of the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963. If the sum of any commercial facilities taxes prescribed by the commercial redevelopment act, 1978 PA 255, MCL 207.651 to 207.668, and the industrial facility taxes paid to the state treasury to the credit of the state school aid fund that would otherwise be disbursed to the local or intermediate school district, under section 12 of the commercial redevelopment act, 1978 PA 255, MCL 207.662, and this section, exceeds the amount received by the local or intermediate school district under sections 56, 62, and 81 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1656, 388.1662, and 388.1681, the department of treasury shall allocate to each eligible local or intermediate school district an amount equal to the difference between the sum of the commercial facilities taxes and the industrial facility taxes paid to the state treasury to the credit of the state school aid fund and the amount the local or intermediate school district received under sections 56, 62, and 81 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1656, 388.1662, and 388.1681.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) For industrial facilities taxes levied before 1994, a local or intermediate school district shall receive or retain its industrial facility tax payment that is levied in any year and becomes a lien before December 1 of the year if the district files a statement with the state treasurer not later than June 30 of the year certifying that the district does not expect to receive state school aid payments under section 56, 62, or 81 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1656, 388.1662, and 388.1681, in the state fiscal year commencing in the year this statement is filed and if the district did not receive state school aid payments under section 56, 62, or 81 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1656, 388.1662, and 388.1681, for the state fiscal year concluding in the year the statement required by this subsection is filed. However, if a local or intermediate school district receives or retains its summer industrial facility tax payment under this subsection and becomes entitled to receive state school aid payments under section 56, 62, or 81 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1656, 388.1662, and 388.1681, in the state fiscal year commencing in the year in which it filed the statement required by this subsection, the district immediately shall pay to the state treasury to the credit of the state school aid fund an amount of the summer industrial facility tax payments that would have been paid to the state treasury to the credit of the state school aid fund under subsection (3) had not this subsection allowed the district to receive or retain the summer industrial facility tax payment.</div>

The industrial facility tax calculated under this subsection shall be disbursed proportionately to the local taxing unit or units that levied the special assessment or the tax described in section 7ff(2) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7ff.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Upon application for an exemption under this subsection by a qualified start-up business, the governing body of a local tax collecting unit may adopt a resolution to exempt a speculative building, a new facility, or a replacement facility of a qualified start-up business from the collection of the industrial facility tax levied under this act in the same manner and under the same terms and conditions as provided for the exemption in section 7hh of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7hh.

The commission shall afford to the holder of the certificate, the local legislative body, the assessor, and a representative of the legislative body of each taxing unit an opportunity for a hearing.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The owner of a new facility exempt from the ad valorem real and personal property taxes as provided in this section shall pay an annual specific tax to be known as the commercial housing facilities tax which shall be determined by multiplying the state equalized value of the new facility, not including the land, by 1/2 of the total mills levied as ad valorem taxes for that year by all taxing units within which the facility is situated.

Apr. 1, 1994 <BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> On March 31, 1993, the Senate passed SB 537 and transmitted it to the House of Representatives, which, on April 29, 1993, passed SB 537, voted to give the bill immediate effect, and returned it to the Senate. On May 5, 1993, the Senate voted to give SB 537 immediate effect and ordered it enrolled. Enrolled SB 537 was presented to the Governor at 8:59 a.m. on May 6, 1993. On May 18, 1993, the Senate sent a message to the Governor respectfully requesting the return of enrolled SB 537; the Governor voluntarily complied with this request and returned enrolled SB 537 to the Senate; following the return of the bill to the Senate chamber, the Senate voted to vacate the enrollment of SB 537; a motion to reconsider the vote by which the bill had been given immediate effect was then made, and its consideration postponed.A letter dated June 9, 1993, from Stanley D.

AUSTIN to vacate the enrollment of Senate Bill 537 as a Public Act of 1993."5) Ordering any and all other relief declared appropriate by this Court."On July 1, 1993, the Senate voted to reconsider its vote giving the bill immediate effect and then defeated a motion to give the bill immediate effect. Senate Bill 537 was ordered enrolled on the same date and presented to the Governor at 3:23 p.m. on July 6, 1993.Also on July 1, 1993, the Senate adopted Senate Resolution No. 179 authorizing the Michigan Senate to seek legal action to vacate the assignment of a public act number to SB 537. In accordance with that resolution, an amended complaint was filed on July 14, 1993, adding the Michigan Senate as a plaintiff and requesting the court to enter judgment in plaintiffs' favor, as follows:"1. Declaring that Senate Bill 537 has not become law, and will not become law until such time as the newly enrolled bill has been duly signed by the Governor, or until such time as the bill is passed by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the Legislature, in the event that the newly enrolled bill should be vetoed by the Governor, or until such time as the newly enrolled bill has remained in the possession of the Governor for a period of more than 14 days, during which time the Legislature has remained in session, without having been signed, vetoed, or otherwise returned to the Legislature by the Governor;"2. Declaring that Senate Bill 537 was lawfully returned to the Senate, and its enrollment lawfully vacated, on May 18, 1993, and that the bill rightfully remained before the Michigan Senate from that date until its subsequent presentment to the Governor on July 6, 1993;"3. Declaring that any action taken by the Defendants inconsistent with the above declarations is unauthorized and unlawful;"4. Ordering the Defendant RICHARD H.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Notwithstanding the distributions provided by subsection (1), if a local governmental unit becomes a qualified local governmental unit entitled to receive distributions from the tax imposed under section 1207 of the Michigan liquor control code of 1998, 1998 PA 58, MCL 436.2207, or from the tax imposed by this act in counties in which the convention facility is located or in a county in which a convention hotel is located that is contiguous to the county in which the convention facility is located, and from any distribution under section 5(b)(iii) of the health and safety fund act, 1987 PA 264, MCL 141.475, no other qualified local governmental unit is entitled to distributions pursuant to this section for which that qualified local governmental unit has previously become entitled, until such time as that qualified local governmental unit ownership or leasehold interest described in subsection (3) is transferred to another local governmental unit. If that transfer renders the transferee a qualified local governmental unit, the transferee is, immediately upon that transfer, entitled to the distributions to a qualified local governmental unit provided in subsection (1) and the priority provided to a qualified local governmental unit in this subsection, notwithstanding that the amount of the distributions may increase as a result of that transfer. A transfer under this subsection includes a transfer that occurs on a transfer date under the regional convention facility authority act, 2008 PA 554, MCL 141.1351 to 141.1379.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2), if the transfer and lease of a qualified convention facility to an authority is disapproved and the authority is dissolved under section 19(1) of the regional convention facility authority act, 2008 PA 554, MCL 141.1369, then a distribution from the convention facility development fund of proceeds received under section 5(b)(iii) of the health and safety fund act, 1987 PA 264, MCL 141.475, shall be made to a building authority for a county having a population of not less than 1,000,000 and not more than 1,500,000 according to the most recent federal decennial census for the purpose of developing, leasing, or operating a convention facility as defined in this act and no other qualified local governmental unit is entitled to any distribution of proceeds received under section 5(b)(iii) of the health and safety fund act, 1987 PA 264, MCL 141.475.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) As used in this act, "qualified local governmental unit" means, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a city, village, township, county, or authority that is located in, or includes within its territory or jurisdiction, a county in which convention hotels are located and that either is the owner or lessee of a convention facility with 350,000 square feet or more of total exhibit space on July 30, 1985 or, if such a convention facility does not exist, will be the owner or lessee of a convention facility with 350,000 square feet or more of total exhibit space through the application of distributions under this section to the purchase or lease of a convention facility. Qualified local governmental unit includes a metropolitan authority that leases, develops, operates, and maintains a qualified convention facility under the regional convention facility authority act, 2008 PA 554, MCL 141.1351 to 141.1379. If the transfer and lease of a qualified convention facility to an authority is disapproved and the authority is dissolved under section 19(1) of the regional convention facility authority act, 2008 PA 554, MCL 141.1369, then for purposes of any distribution from the convention facility development of proceeds under section 5(b)(iii) of the health and safety fund act, 1987 PA 264, MCL 141.475, qualified local governmental unit means a building authority for a county having a population of not less than 1,000,000 and not more than 1,500,000 according to the most recent federal decennial census.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Before the 2015-2016 fiscal year, collections from the excise tax levied for accommodations under this act and collections from the tax imposed under section 1207 of the Michigan liquor control code of 1998, 1998 PA 58, MCL 436.2207, shall not be paid to a qualified local governmental unit for the repayment of bonds, obligations, or other evidences of indebtedness incurred after 2007.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Beginning in fiscal year 2015-2016, and each fiscal year thereafter, if a transfer and a lease of a qualified convention facility is disapproved and an authority is dissolved under section 19(1) of the regional convention facility authority act, 2008 PA 554, MCL 141.1369, then the collections from the excise tax levied for accommodations under this act shall be distributed to each county in which it was levied based on the amount collected in that county. However, if an excise tax for accommodations is levied in a qualified city at a rate greater than the rate levied in that portion of the county in which the qualified city is not located, the qualified city shall receive the collections of the excise tax for accommodations in an amount equal to the difference between the rate levied in the qualified city and the rate levied in that portion of the county in which the qualified city is not located. The funds described in this subsection are not available for a distribution of subsection (1). As used in this subsection, "qualified city" means that term as defined in section 5 of the regional convention facility authority act, 2008 PA 554, MCL 141.1355.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a building authority becomes a qualified local governmental unit under subsection (4), collections from distributions under section 5(b)(iii) of the health and safety fund act, 1987 PA 264, MCL 141.475, shall be paid by the state treasurer on or before the thirtieth day of each month to that building authority.</div>

Am. 2022, Act 276, Eff. Mar. 29, 2023 <BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> On March 31, 1993, the Senate passed SB 537 and transmitted it to the House of Representatives, which, on April 29, 1993, passed SB 537, voted to give the bill immediate effect, and returned it to the Senate. On May 5, 1993, the Senate voted to give SB 537 immediate effect and ordered it enrolled. Enrolled SB 537 was presented to the Governor at 8:59 a.m. on May 6, 1993. On May 18, 1993, the Senate sent a message to the Governor respectfully requesting the return of enrolled SB 537; the Governor voluntarily complied with this request and returned enrolled SB 537 to the Senate; following the return of the bill to the Senate chamber, the Senate voted to vacate the enrollment of SB 537; a motion to reconsider the vote by which the bill had been given immediate effect was then made, and its consideration postponed.A letter dated June 9, 1993, from Stanley D. Steinborn, Chief Assistant Attorney General, to Phillip T. Frangos, Deputy Secretary of State, advised him that "Senate Bill No. 537 is now law and it should be assigned a public act number." At 4:15 p.m. on June 9, 1993, the Secretary of State accepted for filing at the Department of State's Great Seal Office a copy of SB 537 and assigned Public Act No. 58 to the filed document. The filed copy of SB 537 was not the copy presented to the Governor and did not carry the Governor's signature.On June 11, 1993, Dick Posthumus, Majority Leader of the Michigan Senate, John J.H. Schwarz, Assistant President Pro Tempore of the Michigan Senate, and Willis H. Snow, Secretary of the Michigan Senate filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment in the 30th Judicial Circuit Court on June 11, 1993, (Docket No. 93-74943), requesting the court to enter judgment in their favor, as follows:"1) Declaring that Senate Bill 537, the original linen of which is in the possession of the Michigan Senate, and which has never been signed into law by the Governor, has not become law;"2) Declaring that Senate Bill 537, the original linen of which is in the possession of the Michigan Senate, and which has never been signed into law by the Governor, rightfully remains before the Michigan Senate;"3) Declaring that any action taken by the Defendants inconsistent with the above declarations is unauthorized and unlawful;"4) Ordering the Defendant RICHARD H. AUSTIN to vacate the enrollment of Senate Bill 537 as a Public Act of 1993."5) Ordering any and all other relief declared appropriate by this Court."On July 1, 1993, the Senate voted to reconsider its vote giving the bill immediate effect and then defeated a motion to give the bill immediate effect. Senate Bill 537 was ordered enrolled on the same date and presented to the Governor at 3:23 p.m. on July 6, 1993.Also on July 1, 1993, the Senate adopted Senate Resolution No. 179 authorizing the Michigan Senate to seek legal action to vacate the assignment of a public act number to SB 537. In accordance with that resolution, an amended complaint was filed on July 14, 1993, adding the Michigan Senate as a plaintiff and requesting the court to enter judgment in plaintiffs' favor, as follows:"1. Declaring that Senate Bill 537 has not become law, and will not become law until such time as the newly enrolled bill has been duly signed by the Governor, or until such time as the bill is passed by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the Legislature, in the event that the newly enrolled bill should be vetoed by the Governor, or until such time as the newly enrolled bill has remained in the possession of the Governor for a period of more than 14 days, during which time the Legislature has remained in session, without having been signed, vetoed, or otherwise returned to the Legislature by the Governor;"2. Declaring that Senate Bill 537 was lawfully returned to the Senate, and its enrollment lawfully vacated, on May 18, 1993, and that the bill rightfully remained before the Michigan Senate from that date until its subsequent presentment to the Governor on July 6, 1993;"3. Declaring that any action taken by the Defendants inconsistent with the above declarations is unauthorized and unlawful;"4. Ordering the Defendant RICHARD H. AUSTIN to vacate the assignment, to Senate Bill 537, of Public Act No. 58 of the Public Acts of 1993."5. Declaring that Senate Bill 537 shall not take effect until the expiration of 90 days after the final adjournment of the current legislative session, in accordance with Article IV, § 27 of the Michigan Constitution, if the newly enrolled bill is signed by the Governor, is passed by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the Legislature, overriding a gubernatorial veto, or if the newly enrolled bill remains in the possession of the Governor for a period of more than 14 days, during which time the Legislature has remained in session, without having been signed, vetoed, or otherwise returned to the Legislature by the Governor, in accordance with Article IV, § 33 of the Michigan Constitution."6. Ordering the Defendant RICHARD H. AUSTIN to assign a new public act number to Senate Bill 537 if the newly enrolled bill is signed by the Governor, is passed by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the Legislature, overriding a gubernatorial veto, or if the newly enrolled bill remains in the possession of the Governor for a period of more than 14 days, during which time the Legislature has remained in session, without having been signed, vetoed, or otherwise returned to the Legislature by the Governor, in accordance with Article IV, § 33 of the Michigan Constitution."7. Ordering any and all other relief declared appropriate by this Court."The Governor signed enrolled Senate Bill 537 at 8:10 a.m. on July 16, 1993, and filed it with the Secretary of State at 11:02 a.m. on that date. A public act number was not assigned to this filing.On September 7, 1993, the Ingham County Circuit Court, Giddings J., determined that Plaintiffs lacked standing and that Defendants had raised a meritorious defense and were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Defendants' Motion for Summary Disposition was granted.Plaintiffs filed an appeal of the Circuit Court ruling with the Michigan Court of Appeals on September 13, 1993. (Court of Appeals Docket No. 168092). This appeal was dismissed on December 28, 1995.Sec. 9 of Act 106 of 1985, being 207.629 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, as originally enacted, reads:"Sec. 9. (1) On or before the thirtieth day of each month, the state treasurer shall make a distribution from the convention facility development fund to a qualified local governmental unit.

However, distributions for any state fiscal year to any qualified local governmental unit shall not exceed an amount equal to the amount pledged by the qualified local governmental unit for the payment during that state fiscal year of bonds, obligations, or other evidences of indebtedness incurred for the purposes specified in this act, plus any amount necessary to maintain a fully funded debt reserve or other reserves intended to secure the principal and interest on the bonds, obligations, or other evidences of indebtedness as contained in the resolution or ordinance authorizing their issuance."(2) Notwithstanding the distributions provided by subsection (1), if a local governmental unit becomes a qualified local governmental unit entitled to receive distributions from the tax imposed by the convention facility promotion tax act or from the tax imposed by this act in counties in which the convention facility is located or in a county in which a convention hotel is located that is contiguous to the county in which the convention facility is located, no other qualified local governmental unit shall be entitled to distributions pursuant to this section for which that qualified local governmental unit has previously become entitled."(3) A qualified local governmental unit shall be a city, village, township, county, or authority that is located in a county in which convention hotels are located and that either is the owner or lessee of a convention facility with 350,000 square feet or more of total exhibit space on the effective date of this act or, if such a convention facility does not exist, will be the owner or lessee of a convention facility with 350,000 square feet or more of total exhibit space through the application of distributions under this section to the purchase or lease of a convention facility."</p>

An expenditure by this state in violation of this subsection does not invalidate or otherwise adversely affect any previously issued bonds, obligations, or other evidences of indebtedness described in this section or any security therefor.</div>

Am. 2022, Act 276, Eff. Mar. 29, 2023 <BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> On March 31, 1993, the Senate passed SB 537 and transmitted it to the House of Representatives, which, on April 29, 1993, passed SB 537, voted to give the bill immediate effect, and returned it to the Senate. On May 5, 1993, the Senate voted to give SB 537 immediate effect and ordered it enrolled. Enrolled SB 537 was presented to the Governor at 8:59 a.m. on May 6, 1993. On May 18, 1993, the Senate sent a message to the Governor respectfully requesting the return of enrolled SB 537; the Governor voluntarily complied with this request and returned enrolled SB 537 to the Senate; following the return of the bill to the Senate chamber, the Senate voted to vacate the enrollment of SB 537; a motion to reconsider the vote by which the bill had been given immediate effect was then made, and its consideration postponed.A letter dated June 9, 1993, from Stanley D. Steinborn, Chief Assistant Attorney General, to Phillip T. Frangos, Deputy Secretary of State, advised him that “Senate Bill No. 537 is now law and it should be assigned a public act number.” At 4:15 p.m. on June 9, 1993, the Secretary of State accepted for filing at the Department of State's Great Seal Office a copy of SB 537 and assigned Public Act No. 58 to the filed document. The filed copy of SB 537 was not the copy presented to the Governor and did not carry the Governor's signature.On June 11, 1993, Dick Posthumus, Majority Leader of the Michigan Senate, John J.H.

AUSTIN to vacate the enrollment of Senate Bill 537 as a Public Act of 1993. “5) Ordering any and all other relief declared appropriate by this Court.”On July 1, 1993, the Senate voted to reconsider its vote giving the bill immediate effect and then defeated a motion to give the bill immediate effect. Senate Bill 537 was ordered enrolled on the same date and presented to the Governor at 3:23 p.m. on July 6, 1993.Also on July 1, 1993, the Senate adopted Senate Resolution No. 179 authorizing the Michigan Senate to seek legal action to vacate the assignment of a public act number to SB 537. In accordance with that resolution, an amended complaint was filed on July 14, 1993, adding the Michigan Senate as a plaintiff and requesting the court to enter judgment in plaintiffs' favor, as follows:“1. Declaring that Senate Bill 537 has not become law, and will not become law until such time as the newly enrolled bill has been duly signed by the Governor, or until such time as the bill is passed by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the Legislature, in the event that the newly enrolled bill should be vetoed by the Governor, or until such time as the newly enrolled bill has remained in the possession of the Governor for a period of more than 14 days, during which time the Legislature has remained in session, without having been signed, vetoed, or otherwise returned to the Legislature by the Governor;“2. Declaring that Senate Bill 537 was lawfully returned to the Senate, and its enrollment lawfully vacated, on May 18, 1993, and that the bill rightfully remained before the Michigan Senate from that date until its subsequent presentment to the Governor on July 6, 1993; “3. Declaring that any action taken by the Defendants inconsistent with the above declarations is unauthorized and unlawful;“4. Ordering the Defendant RICHARD H.

Declaring that Senate Bill 537 shall not take effect until the expiration of 90 days after the final adjournment of the current legislative session, in accordance with Article IV, § 27 of the Michigan Constitution, if the newly enrolled bill is signed by the Governor, is passed by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the Legislature, overriding a gubernatorial veto, or if the newly enrolled bill remains in the possession of the Governor for a period of more than 14 days, during which time the Legislature has remained in session, without having been signed, vetoed, or otherwise returned to the Legislature by the Governor, in accordance with Article IV, § 33 of the Michigan Constitution.“6. Ordering the Defendant RICHARD H. AUSTIN to assign a new public act number to Senate Bill 537 if the newly enrolled bill is signed by the Governor, is passed by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the Legislature, overriding a gubernatorial veto, or if the newly enrolled bill remains in the possession of the Governor for a period of more than 14 days, during which time the Legislature has remained in session, without having been signed, vetoed, or otherwise returned to the Legislature by the Governor, in accordance with Article IV, § 33 of the Michigan Constitution.“7.

The state treasurer shall make findings regarding whether the proposed project is reasonable, whether the revenues and other funds will be sufficient to fund the proposed project, and any other projects necessary for the completion of the proposed project, and whether the proposed project and financing comply with the provisions of this act. The state treasurer shall notify the local governmental unit of the findings pursuant to this section and shall approve or disapprove the proposed project within 30 days after submission of the plans for the proposed project and financing.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The amount of the commercial facilities tax, in each year, for a restored facility shall be determined by multiplying the total mills levied as ad valorem taxes for that year by all taxing units within which the facility is situated by the taxable value of the real property of the obsolete commercial property for the tax year immediately preceding the effective date of the commercial facilities exemption certificate after deducting the taxable value of the land and of personal property other than personal property assessed pursuant to section 14(6) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.14.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   For the period during which the certificate is in effect, a facility for which a certificate is in effect, but not the land on which the facility is located or the inventory in the facility, is exempt from ad valorem real and personal property taxes.

The certificate may be issued for a period of at least 1 year, but not to exceed 12 years. If the number of years determined is less than 12, the certificate is subject to review by the legislative body of the local governmental unit, and the certificate may be extended.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in subsections (8) and (9), there is levied upon every owner of record and every user or occupant, if known, of a facility to which a certificate is issued, a specific tax to be known as a technology park facilities tax.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The amount of the technology park facilities tax in each year shall be determined by multiplying the state equalized valuation of the facility excluding the land and the inventory personal property by the sum of 1/2 of the total mills levied as ad valorem taxes for that year by all taxing units within which the facility is located other than mills levied by a local or intermediate school district within which the facility is located for school operating purposes or mills levied under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, plus 1/2 of the number of mills levied for school operating purposes in 1993.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The technology park facilities tax shall be collected, disbursed, and assessed in accordance with this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The technology park facilities tax shall be an annual tax payable at the same time, in the same manner, and to the same officer or officers as taxes imposed under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, are payable. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the officer or officers shall disburse technology park facilities tax payments received each year to the state, cities, townships, villages, school districts, counties, community and junior colleges, and authorities, at the times and in the proportions required by law for the disbursement of taxes collected under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155. To determine the proportion for the disbursement of taxes under this subsection and for attribution of taxes under subsection (6) for taxes collected pursuant to technology park facilities exemption certificates issued before January 1, 1994, the number of mills levied for local school district operating purposes to be used in the calculation shall equal the number of mills for local school district operating purposes levied in 1993 minus the number of mills levied under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, for the year for which the disbursement is calculated.</div>

The technology park facilities tax calculated under this subsection shall be disbursed proportionately to the local taxing unit or units that levied the special assessment or the tax described in section 7ff(2) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7ff.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Upon application for an exemption under this subsection by a qualified start-up business, the governing body of a local tax collecting unit may adopt a resolution to exempt a facility of a qualified start-up business from the collection of the technology park facilities tax levied under this act in the same manner and under the same terms and conditions as provided for the exemption in section 7hh of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7hh. The clerk of the local tax collecting unit shall notify in writing the assessor of the local tax collecting unit and the legislative body of each taxing unit that levies ad valorem property taxes in the local tax collecting unit. Before acting on the resolution, the governing body of the local tax collecting unit shall afford the assessor and a representative of the affected taxing units an opportunity for a hearing. If a resolution authorizing the exemption is adopted in the same manner as provided in section 7hh of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7hh, the facility owned or operated by a qualified start-up business is exempt from the technology park facilities tax levied under this act, except for that portion of the technology park facilities tax attributable to a special assessment or a tax described in section 7ff(2) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7ff, for the year in which the resolution is adopted. A qualified start-up business is not eligible for an exemption under this subsection for more than 5 years. A qualified start-up business may receive the exemption under this subsection in nonconsecutive years. The technology park facilities tax calculated under this subsection shall be disbursed proportionately to the taxing unit or units that levied the special assessment or the tax described in section 7ff(2) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7ff. As used in this subsection, "qualified start-up business" means that term as defined in section 31a of the single business tax act, 1975 PA 228, MCL 208.31a, or in section 415 of the Michigan business tax act, 2007 PA 36, MCL 208.1415.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The governing body of a local governmental unit by resolution may designate 1 or more neighborhood enterprise zones within that local governmental unit. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a neighborhood enterprise zone shall contain not less than 10 platted parcels of land. A neighborhood enterprise zone located in a qualified downtown revitalization district may contain less than 10 platted parcels if the platted parcels together contain 10 or more facilities. All the land within a neighborhood enterprise zone shall also be compact and contiguous. Contiguity is not broken by a road, right-of-way, or property purchased or taken under condemnation if the purchased or condemned property was a single parcel prior to the sale or condemnation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The total acreage of the neighborhood enterprise zones containing only new facilities or rehabilitated facilities or any combination of new facilities or rehabilitated facilities designated under this act shall not exceed 15% of the total acreage contained within the boundaries of the local governmental unit. The total acreage of the neighborhood enterprise zones containing only homestead facilities designated under this act shall not exceed 10% of the total acreage contained within the boundaries of the local governmental unit or, with the approval of the board of commissioners of the county in which the neighborhood enterprise zone is located if the county does not have an elected or appointed county executive or with the approval of the board of commissioners and the county executive of the county in which the neighborhood enterprise zone is located if the county has an elected or appointed county executive, 15% of the total acreage contained within the boundaries of the local governmental unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Not less than 60 days before the passage of a resolution designating a neighborhood enterprise zone or the repeal or amendment of a resolution under subsection (5), the clerk of the local governmental unit shall give written notice to the assessor and to the governing body of each taxing unit that levies ad valorem property taxes in the proposed neighborhood enterprise zone. Before acting upon the resolution, the governing body of the local governmental unit shall make a finding that a proposed neighborhood enterprise zone is consistent with the master plan of the local governmental unit and the neighborhood preservation and economic development goals of the local governmental unit. The governing body before acting upon the resolution shall also adopt a statement of the local governmental unit's goals, objectives, and policies relative to the maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development of housing for all persons regardless of income level living within the proposed neighborhood enterprise zone. Additionally, before acting upon the resolution, the governing body of a local governmental unit with a population greater than 20,000 shall pass a housing inspection ordinance. A local governmental unit with a population of 20,000 or less may pass a housing inspection ordinance. Before the sale of a unit in a new or rehabilitated facility for which a neighborhood enterprise zone certificate is in effect, an inspection shall be made of the unit to determine compliance with any local construction or safety codes and that a sale may not be finalized until there is compliance with those local construction or safety codes. The governing body shall hold a public hearing not later than 45 days after the date the notice is sent but before acting upon the resolution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Upon receipt of a notice under subsection (3), the assessor shall determine and furnish to the governing body of the local governmental unit the amount of the true cash value of the property located within the proposed neighborhood enterprise zone and any other information considered necessary by the governing body.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A resolution designating a neighborhood enterprise zone, other than a zone designated under subsection (2), may be repealed or amended not sooner than 3 years after the date of adoption or of the most recent amendment of the resolution by the governing body of the local governmental unit. The repeal or amendment of the resolution shall take effect 6 months after adoption. However, an action taken under this subsection does not invalidate a certificate that is issued or in effect and a facility for which a certificate is issued or in effect shall continue to be included in the total acreage limitations under this section until the certificate is expired or revoked.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A resolution designating a neighborhood enterprise zone in an obsolete property rehabilitation district that was created by a local unit of government on June 6, 2003, and for which the state tax commission issued obsolete property rehabilitation certificates on August 26, 2003, and September 24, 2003 will cause any previous certificate to expire on the December 30 immediately preceding the December 31 on which the first neighborhood enterprise zone certificate is effective. The taxable value of the parcel shall be calculated using the value of the parcel before the building permit was issued. This subdivision authorizes an amended obsolete property rehabilitation certificate approved by the state tax commission for the portion of the parcel contained in the original certificate for which an application for a neighborhood enterprise zone certificate was not submitted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Beginning June 1, 2023, in addition to all other requirements under this act, both of the following apply in a city, township, or village that became a local governmental unit pursuant to the amendatory act that added this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A local governmental unit may designate a neighborhood enterprise zone only if the local governmental unit determines that both of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The designation encourages compact development and the neighborhood enterprise zone contains 5 or more existing residential units per acre at the time of designation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The neighborhood enterprise zone is adjacent to existing development, can utilize existing infrastructure, and has access to municipal water and sewer services on at least 1 frontage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Notwithstanding section 9, for that part of a facility that in the prior year was occupied by an individual, couple, family, or group of unrelated individuals with a combined adjusted household income in excess of 120% of the countywide area median income as posted by the Michigan state housing development authority on its website, the specific tax paid in lieu of taxes for the year must be equal to the full amount of the taxes that would be paid on that portion of the facility if the facility were not tax exempt.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this section, "adjusted household income" means that term as defined in R 125.101 of the Michigan Administrative Code.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in subsection (14), there is levied on the owner of a homestead facility, a new facility, or a rehabilitated facility to which a neighborhood enterprise zone certificate is issued a specific tax known as the neighborhood enterprise zone tax.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A homestead facility, a new facility, or a rehabilitated facility for which a neighborhood enterprise zone certificate is in effect, but not the land on which the facility is located, is exempt from ad valorem real property taxes collected under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of the neighborhood enterprise zone tax on a new facility is determined each year by multiplying the taxable value of the facility, not including the land, by 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For property that would otherwise meet the definition of a principal residence under section 7dd of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7dd, if that property was not exempt from ad valorem property taxes under this act, 1/2 of the average rate of taxation levied in this state in the immediately preceding calendar year on a principal residence and qualified agricultural property as defined in section 7dd of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7dd. However, in 1994 only, the average rate of taxation shall be the average rate of taxation levied in 1993 upon all property in this state upon which ad valorem taxes are assessed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For property that is not a principal residence under section 7dd of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7dd, 1/2 of the average rate of taxation levied upon commercial, industrial, and utility property upon which ad valorem taxes are assessed as determined for the immediately preceding calendar year by the state board of assessors under section 13 of 1905 PA 282, MCL 207.13. However, in 1994 only, the average rate of taxation shall be the average rate of taxation levied in 1993 upon all property in this state upon which ad valorem taxes are assessed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of the neighborhood enterprise zone tax on a rehabilitated facility is determined each year by multiplying the taxable value of the rehabilitated facility, not including the land, for the tax year immediately preceding the effective date of the neighborhood enterprise zone certificate by the total mills collected under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157, for the current year by all taxing units within which the rehabilitated facility is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of the neighborhood enterprise zone tax on a homestead facility is the sum of all the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) One-half the number of mills levied for operating purposes by the local governmental unit in which the neighborhood enterprise zone is located multiplied by the current taxable value of the homestead facility not including the land.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) One-half the number of mills levied for operating purposes by the county in which the neighborhood enterprise zone is located multiplied by the current taxable value of the homestead facility not including the land.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The total number of mills collected under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157, for the current year by all taxing jurisdictions within which the homestead facility is located excluding the number of mills levied for operating purposes by the local governmental unit and county in which the homestead facility is located multiplied by the current taxable value of the homestead facility not including the land.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) In the year 2 years before the year in which the neighborhood enterprise zone certificate expires for a homestead facility, for a new facility or a rehabilitated facility in which the neighborhood enterprise zone certificate was issued after December 31, 2005, or for a new facility or a rehabilitated facility in which the neighborhood enterprise zone certificate was extended 3 years under section 12(1), the neighborhood enterprise zone tax is the sum of all the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Five-eighths the number of mills levied for operating purposes by the local governmental unit in which the neighborhood enterprise zone is located multiplied by the current taxable value of the facility not including the land.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Five-eighths the number of mills levied for operating purposes by the county in which the neighborhood enterprise zone is located multiplied by the current taxable value of the facility not including the land.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The total number of mills collected under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157, for the current year by all taxing jurisdictions within which the facility is located excluding the number of mills levied for operating purposes by the local governmental unit and county in which the facility is located multiplied by the current taxable value of the facility not including the land.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) In the year before the year in which the neighborhood enterprise zone certificate expires for a homestead facility, for a new facility or a rehabilitated facility in which the neighborhood enterprise zone certificate was issued after December 31, 2005, or for a new facility or a rehabilitated facility in which the neighborhood enterprise zone certificate was extended 3 years under section 12(1), the neighborhood enterprise zone tax is the sum of all the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Three-fourths the number of mills levied for operating purposes by the county in which the neighborhood enterprise zone is located multiplied by the current taxable value of the facility not including the land.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) In the year in which the neighborhood enterprise zone certificate expires for a homestead facility, for a new facility or a rehabilitated facility in which the neighborhood enterprise zone certificate was issued after December 31, 2005, or for a new facility or a rehabilitated facility in which the neighborhood enterprise zone certificate was extended 3 years under section 12(1), the neighborhood enterprise zone tax is the sum of all the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The neighborhood enterprise zone tax is an annual tax, payable at the same times, in the same installments, and to the same officer or officers as taxes collected under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157, are payable. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the officer or officers shall disburse the neighborhood enterprise zone tax received by the officer or officers each year to the state, cities, townships, villages, school districts, counties, and authorities at the same times and in the same proportions as required for the disbursement of taxes collected under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157. To determine the proportion for the disbursement of taxes under this subsection and for attribution of taxes under subsection (11) for taxes collected after June 30, 1994, the number of mills levied for local school district operating purposes to be used in the calculation shall equal the number of mills for local school district operating purposes levied in 1993 minus the number of mills levied under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, for the year for which the disbursement is calculated. Local tax collection officers shall disburse the proceeds of the neighborhood enterprise zone tax collected on homestead facilities under subsection (5) and on homestead facilities, new facilities, and rehabilitated facilities under subsections (6), (7), and (8) each year to the state, cities, townships, villages, school districts, counties, and authorities in an amount equal to the sum of the proceeds of the neighborhood enterprise zone tax collected on the facility multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is the number of mills levied by the taxing unit that was used to calculate the specific tax on the facility and the denominator is the total number of mills levied by all the taxing units that was used to calculate the specific tax in which the property is located. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) An intermediate school district receiving state aid under sections 56, 62, and 81 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1656, 388.1662, and 388.1681, of the amount that would otherwise be disbursed to or retained by the intermediate school district, all or a portion, to be determined on the basis of the tax rates being utilized to compute the amount of state aid, shall be paid to the state treasury to the credit of the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963. If and for the period that the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1601 to 388.1772, is amended or its successor act is enacted or amended to include a provision that provides for adjustments in state school aid to account for the receipt of revenues provided under this act in place of exempted ad valorem property tax, revenues required to be remitted or returned to the state treasury to the credit of the state school aid fund shall be distributed instead to the intermediate school districts. If the sum of any industrial facility tax levied under 1974 PA 198, MCL 207.551 to 207.572, the commercial facilities tax levied under the commercial redevelopment act, 1978 PA 255, MCL 207.651 to 207.668, and the neighborhood enterprise zone tax paid to the state treasury to the credit of the state school aid fund that would otherwise be disbursed to the intermediate school district exceeds the amount received by the intermediate school district under sections 56, 62, and 81 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1656, 388.1662, and 388.1681, the department of treasury shall allocate to each eligible intermediate school district an amount equal to the difference between the sum of the industrial facility tax, the commercial facilities tax, and the neighborhood enterprise zone tax paid to the state treasury to the credit of the state school aid fund and the amount the intermediate school district received under sections 56, 62, and 81 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1656, 388.1662, and 388.1681.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) For neighborhood enterprise zone taxes levied after 1993 for school operating purposes, the amount that would otherwise be disbursed to a local school district shall be paid instead to the state treasury and credited to the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The officer or officers shall send a copy of the amount of disbursement made to each unit under this section to the commission on a form provided by the commission. The neighborhood enterprise zone tax is a lien on the real property upon which the new facility or rehabilitated facility subject to the certificate is located until paid. The continuance of a certificate is conditional upon the annual payment of the neighborhood enterprise zone tax and the ad valorem tax on the land collected under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) If payment of the tax under this act is not made by the March 1 following the levy of the tax, the tax shall be turned over to the county treasurer and collected in the same manner as a delinquent tax under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) A homestead facility, a new facility, or a rehabilitated facility located in a renaissance zone under the Michigan renaissance zone act, 1996 PA 376, MCL 125.2681 to 125.2696, is exempt from the neighborhood enterprise zone tax levied under this act to the extent and for the duration provided pursuant to the Michigan renaissance zone act, 1996 PA 376, MCL 125.2681 to 125.2696, except for that portion of the neighborhood enterprise zone tax attributable to a special assessment or a tax described in section 7ff(2) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7ff. The neighborhood enterprise zone tax calculated under this subsection shall be disbursed proportionately to the local taxing unit or units that levied the special assessment or the tax described in section 7ff(2) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7ff.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) On receipt of a request by certified mail to the qualified assessing authority by the holder of a neighborhood enterprise zone certificate requesting revocation of the certificate, the qualified assessing authority by order shall revoke the certificate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A certificate issued before January 1, 2017 expires if the owner fails to complete the filing requirements under section 10 within 2 years of the date the certificate was issued. A certificate issued after December 31, 2016 expires if the owner fails to complete the filing requirements under section 10 within 3 years of the date the certificate was issued. The holder of the certificate may request in writing to the qualified assessing authority before the expiration of the certificate or within 1 year of the expiration of the certificate, a 1-year automatic extension of the deadlines provided in this subsection if the owner has proceeded in good faith with the construction or rehabilitation of the facility in a manner consistent with the purposes of this act and the delay in completion or occupancy by an owner is due to circumstances beyond the control of the holder of the certificate. The holder of a certificate issued before March 23, 2020 may request in writing to the qualified assessing authority not later than 1 year after the expiration of the certificate, a 1-year automatic extension of deadlines provided in this subsection, in addition to any extensions already exercised by the holder of the certificate. On request of the governing body of the local governmental unit, the qualified assessing authority shall extend the certificate if the new facility has not been occupied.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The certificate for a homestead facility or new facility is automatically revoked if the homestead facility or new facility is no longer a homestead as that term is defined in section 7a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7a. However, if the owner or any subsequent owner submits a certificate before the revocation is effective, the qualified assessing authority, on application of the owner, shall rescind the order of revocation. If the certificate is submitted after revocation of the certificate, the qualified assessing authority, on application of the owner, shall reinstate the certificate for the remaining period of time for which the original certificate would have been in effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the owner of the facility fails to make the annual payment of the neighborhood enterprise zone tax and the ad valorem property tax on the land under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, the qualified assessing authority by order shall revoke the certificate. However, if payment of these taxes is made before the revocation is effective, the qualified assessing authority, on application of the owner, shall rescind the order of revocation. If payment of these taxes and any subsequent ad valorem property tax due on the facility is made after revocation of the certificate, the qualified assessing authority, on application of the owner, shall reinstate the certificate for the remaining period of time for which the original certificate would have been in effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a homestead facility, a new facility, or a rehabilitated facility ceases to have as its primary purpose residential housing, the qualified assessing authority by order shall revoke the certificate for that facility. A new or rehabilitated facility does not cease to be used for its primary purpose if it is temporarily damaged or destroyed in whole or in part.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the governing body of a local governmental unit determines that a homestead facility, a new facility, or a rehabilitated facility is not in compliance with any local construction, building, or safety codes and notifies the qualified assessing authority by certified mail of the noncompliance, the qualified assessing authority by order shall revoke the certificate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The revocation is effective beginning the December 31 following the date of the order or, if the certificate is automatically revoked under subsection (3), the December 31 following the automatic revocation. The qualified assessing authority shall send by certified mail copies of the order of revocation to the holder of the certificate and to the assessor of that local governmental unit, and to the legislative body of each taxing unit that levies taxes upon property in the local governmental unit in which the new facility or rehabilitated facility is located.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) A minimum of 5 qualified new jobs at the facility if the eligible business is a qualified high-technology business.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) A minimum of 5 qualified new jobs at the facility if the eligible business is a rural business.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Except as provided in subsection (5), the eligible business agrees to maintain 1 or more of the following for each year that a credit is authorized under this act:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A minimum of 50 qualified new jobs at the facility if expanding in this state.</div>

After an eligible business has entered into a written agreement as provided in subsection (2), the authority may adjust the number of full-time jobs required to be maintained by the authorized business under this subdivision, in order to adjust for decreases in full-time jobs in the authorized business in this state due to the divestiture of operations, provided a single other person continues to maintain those full-time jobs in this state.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The tax credits offered under this act are an incentive to expand, retain, or locate the eligible business in Michigan and address the competitive disadvantages with sites outside this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A cost/benefit analysis reveals that authorizing the eligible business to receive tax credits under this act will result in an overall positive fiscal impact to the state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the authority determines that the requirements of subsection (1), (5), (9), or (11) have been met, the authority shall determine the amount and duration of tax credits to be authorized under section 9, and shall enter into a written agreement as provided in this section.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The cost differential to the business between expanding, locating, or retaining new jobs in Michigan and a site outside of Michigan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The potential impact of the expansion, retention, or location on the economy of Michigan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The cost of the credit under section 9, the staff, financial, or economic assistance provided by the local government unit, or local economic development corporation or similar entity, and the value of assistance otherwise provided by this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Whether the expansion, retention, or location will occur in this state without the tax credits offered under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Whether the authorized business reuses or redevelops property that was previously used for an industrial or commercial purpose in locating the facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The project's effects on other Michigan businesses within the same industry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A written agreement between an eligible business and the authority shall include, but need not be limited to, all of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A statement by the eligible business that a misrepresentation in the application may result in the revocation of the designation as an authorized business and the refund of credits received under section 9 plus a penalty equal to 10% of the credits received under section 9.</div>

The eligible business may not discriminate against any contractor on the basis of its affiliation or nonaffiliation with any collective bargaining organization.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The eligible business will make a good-faith effort to employ, if qualified, Michigan residents at the facility.</div>

However, the next available residential dwelling unit located on the property shall be reserved for an income-qualified household.

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>207.910 Attainable housing facilities tax; determination of amount; exemption; payment; disbursements.</B><P>Sec. 10.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The attainable housing facilities tax is levied upon every owner of a qualified facility to which a certificate is issued under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of the attainable housing facilities tax on a new facility is determined each year by multiplying 1/2 of the average rate of taxation levied upon commercial, industrial, and utility property upon which ad valorem taxes are assessed as determined for the immediately preceding calendar year by the state board of assessors under section 13 of 1905 PA 282, MCL 207.13, by the current taxable value of the new facility after deducting the taxable value of the land.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of the attainable housing facilities tax on a rehabilitated facility is determined each year by multiplying 1/2 of the average rate of taxation levied upon commercial, industrial, and utility property upon which ad valorem taxes are assessed as determined for the immediately preceding calendar year by the state board of assessors under section 13 of 1905 PA 282, MCL 207.13, by the current taxable value of the rehabilitated facility after deducting the taxable value of the land.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Within 60 days after the granting of an attainable housing exemption certificate under section 6 for a new facility, if the state treasurer does not determine that reducing the number of mills levied under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, and used to calculate the specific tax under subsection (2) is necessary to provide an adequate supply of housing for income-qualified households in this state, the millage rate used to calculate the specific tax under subsection (2) shall be increased by 3 mills. If the state treasurer determines that further reducing the millage rate used to calculate the specific tax under subsection (2) is necessary to provide an adequate supply of housing for income-qualified households in this state, the state treasurer may exclude an additional 3 mills levied under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, from the millage rate used to calculate the specific tax under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3), the specific tax paid each year for that part of a qualified facility that is exempt from ad valorem property taxes under section 7 and not used as attainable housing property in the immediately preceding year must be equal to the amount of the ad valorem property taxes that would be paid on that portion of the qualified facility if the qualified facility were not exempt from ad valorem property taxes under section 7. The owner of the qualified facility must allocate the benefits of any tax exemption granted under this act exclusively to attainable housing property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The specific tax is an annual tax, payable at the same times, in the same installments, and to the same officer or officers as taxes imposed under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, are payable. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the officer or officers shall disburse the specific tax payments received by the officer or officers each year to and among this state, cities, school districts, counties, and authorities, at the same times and in the same proportions as required by law for the disbursement of taxes collected under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For intermediate school districts receiving state aid under sections 56 and 62 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1656 and 388.1662, of the amount of the specific tax that would otherwise be disbursed to an intermediate school district, all or a portion, to be determined on the basis of the tax rates being utilized to compute the amount of state aid, must be paid to the state treasury to the credit of the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The amount of specific tax described in this section that would otherwise be disbursed to a local school district for school operating purposes must be paid instead to the state treasury and credited to the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The officer or officers shall send a copy of the amount of disbursement made to each unit under this section to the department on a form provided by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A qualified facility located in a renaissance zone under the Michigan renaissance zone act, 1996 PA 376, MCL 125.2681 to 125.2696, is exempt from the specific tax levied under this act to the extent and for the duration provided pursuant to the Michigan renaissance zone act, 1996 PA 376, MCL 125.2681 to 125.2696, except for that portion of the specific tax attributable to a special assessment or a tax described in section 7ff(2) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7ff. The specific tax calculated under this subsection must be disbursed proportionately to the taxing unit or units that levied the special assessment or the tax described in section 7ff(2) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7ff.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The residential housing facility tax is levied upon every owner of a qualified residential facility to which a certificate is issued under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of the residential housing facility tax on a new residential facility is determined each year by multiplying 1/2 of the average rate of taxation levied upon commercial, industrial, and utility property upon which ad valorem taxes are assessed as determined for the immediately preceding calendar year by the state board of assessors under section 13 of 1905 PA 282, MCL 207.13, by the current taxable value of the new residential facility after deducting the taxable value of the land.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of the residential housing facility tax on a rehabilitated residential facility is determined each year by multiplying 1/2 of the average rate of taxation levied upon commercial, industrial, and utility property upon which ad valorem taxes are assessed as determined for the immediately preceding calendar year by the state board of assessors under section 13 of 1905 PA 282, MCL 207.13, by the current taxable value of the rehabilitated residential facility after deducting the taxable value of the land.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Within 60 days after the granting of a residential housing exemption certificate under section 6 for a new residential facility, if the state treasurer does not determine that reducing the number of mills levied under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, and used to calculate the specific tax under subsection (2) is necessary to provide an adequate supply of residential housing for income-qualified households in this state, the millage rate used to calculate the specific tax under subsection (2) shall be increased by 3 mills. If the state treasurer determines that further reducing the millage rate used to calculate the specific tax under subsection (2) is necessary to provide an adequate supply of residential housing for income-qualified households in this state, the state treasurer may exclude an additional 3 mills levied under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, from the millage rate used to calculate the specific tax under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3), the specific tax paid each year for that part of a qualified residential facility that is exempt from ad valorem property taxes under section 7 and not used as residential housing property in the immediately preceding year must be equal to the amount of the ad valorem property taxes that would be paid on that portion of the qualified residential facility if the qualified residential facility were not exempt from ad valorem property taxes under section 7. The owner of the qualified residential facility must allocate the benefits of any tax exemption granted under this act exclusively to residential housing property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The specific tax is an annual tax, payable at the same times, in the same installments, and to the same officer or officers as taxes imposed under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, are payable. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the officer or officers shall disburse the specific tax payments received by the officer or officers each year to and among this state, cities, school districts, counties, and authorities, at the same times and in the same proportions as required by law for the disbursement of taxes collected under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For intermediate school districts receiving state aid under sections 56 and 62 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1656 and 388.1662, of the amount of specific tax that would otherwise be disbursed to an intermediate school district, all or a portion, to be determined on the basis of the tax rates being utilized to compute the amount of state aid, shall be paid to the state treasury to the credit of the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The amount of specific tax described in this section that would otherwise be disbursed to a local school district for school operating purposes must be paid instead to the state treasury and credited to the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The officer or officers shall send a copy of the amount of disbursement made to each unit under this section to the department on a form provided by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A qualified residential facility located in a renaissance zone under the Michigan renaissance zone act, 1996 PA 376, MCL 125.2681 to 125.2696, is exempt from the specific tax levied under this act to the extent and for the duration provided pursuant to the Michigan renaissance zone act, 1996 PA 376, MCL 125.2681 to 125.2696, except for that portion of the specific tax attributable to a special assessment or a tax described in section 7ff(2) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7ff. The specific tax calculated under this subsection must be disbursed proportionately to the taxing unit or units that levied the special assessment or the tax described in section 7ff(2) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7ff.</div>

The release does not affect any liability accruing before the expiration of the 60-day period. After receiving a written request for release, the department shall promptly notify the licensee furnishing the bond that a release has been requested. If the licensee does not obtain a new bond that meets the requirements of this act and does not file the new bond with the department within the 60-day period, the department may revoke the licensee's license.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Sixty days after a licensee makes a written request to the department for release of a cash deposit, the cash deposit is canceled as security for any obligation accruing after the expiration of the 60-day period. However, the department may retain all or part of the cash deposit for up to 4 years and 1 day as security for any obligations accruing before the effective date of the cancellation. Any part of the deposit that is not retained by the department shall be released to the licensee. Before the expiration of the 60-day period, the licensee may be required to provide the department with a bond that satisfies the requirements of this act.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A licensed supplier or licensed permissive supplier may elect to treat all removals from all of its terminals located outside of the United States with a destination in this state as shown on the terminal-issued shipping paper as if the motor fuel were removed across the rack by the supplier from a terminal in this state for all purposes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The election provided under subsection (2) shall be made by filing with the department a notice of election.</DIV>

If a purchaser makes an election with more than 1 supplier, the bond amount shall be based on the tax due to all suppliers with whom the elections were made. The department may require, but is not limited to requiring, that the bond be reasonably sufficient to indemnify the department against uncollectible tax credits claimed by the supplier under section 16.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The department may, after a properly noticed hearing before the department administrator responsible for implementing and enforcing this act or his or her designee, and after a showing of good cause, revoke a purchaser's election under section 74.
