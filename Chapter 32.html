<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An officer in charge may impose upon an enlisted member assigned to the unit of which the officer is in charge a punishment authorized under subsection (1)(c) as the adjutant general concerned may specifically prescribe by rule.</div>

In addition, the officer may remit or mitigate any part or amount of the unexecuted punishment imposed and may set aside in whole or in part the punishment, whether executed or unexecuted, and restore all rights, privileges, and property affected. The officer also may mitigate reduction in grade to forfeiture or detention of pay.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) When mitigating arrest in quarters to restriction, correctional custody to extra duties or restriction, or both, or extra duties to restrictions, the mitigated punishment shall not be for a greater period than the punishment mitigated.

The appeal shall be made not later than 45 days after the punishment is adjudged. The appeal shall be promptly forwarded and decided, and the person punished shall not be required to undergo the punishment adjudged before a decision on the appeal is rendered. The officer who imposes the punishment, the officer's successor in command, or superior authority is authorized to suspend, set aside, or remit any part or amount of the punishment and to restore all rights, privileges, and property affected. The authority who is to act on the appeal shall refer the case to a judge advocate for consideration and advice before acting upon the appeal. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment under this section for an act or omission is not a bar to trial by court-martial for a serious crime or offense growing out of the same act or omission and not properly punishable under this section. The fact that disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be shown by the accused upon trial, and when so shown shall be considered in determining the measure of punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding of guilty.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The adjutant general, by regulation, may prescribe the form of records to be kept of proceedings under this section and may also prescribe that certain categories of those proceedings shall be in writing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Before being informed of the disciplinary action to be taken under this section, the person to be punished has the right to demand trial by court-martial for the offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If a punishment of forfeiture of pay and allowance is imposed as provided in this section, the forfeiture may apply to pay or allowances becoming due on or after the date of the punishment but shall not apply to pay and allowances accrued before the date.</div>

<P>Sec. 32.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A charge or specification shall not be referred to a general courtmartial for trial until a thorough and impartial investigation of all matters set forth in the charge or specification has been made. The conduct of this investigation is the responsibility of the officer exercising special court-martial jurisdiction over the accused and shall include inquiry as to the truth of the matter set forth in the charges, consideration of the form of charges, and a recommendation as to the disposition which should be made of the case in the interest of justice and discipline. The investigating officer shall submit a formal report to the convening authority, the state judge advocate, and the accused. This report shall include the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A statement of the name, organization, or address of counsel and information as to the presence or absence of counsel throughout the proceedings if counsel has been requested by the accused.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A summarized statement of all relevant testimony including the names and units, if applicable, of the persons giving testimony.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A statement indicating all sources of information considered by that officer in reaching conclusions or making recommendations.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A statement of the names and units of all witnesses essential to the defense or prosecution of the case.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Before an investigation initiated pursuant to this code, the accused shall be informed of the accused's rights under section 31, including the right to counsel, in the manner provided in that section, and, in addition, shall be informed of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The offense of which the accused is suspected, accused, or charged.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The name of the accuser and the witnesses against the accused which are known by the investigating officer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The fact that charges are about to be investigated.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   At an investigation, full opportunity shall be given to the accused to cross-examine witnesses if they are available, and to present anything the accused may desire in the accused's own behalf, either in defense or mitigation, and the investigation officer shall examine available witnesses requested by the accused.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If an investigation of the subject matter of an offense has been conducted before the accused is charged with the offense, and if the accused was present at the investigation and afforded the opportunities for representation, cross-examination, and presentation prescribed in subsections (2) and (3), further investigation of that charge is not necessary under this section unless it is demanded by the accused after the accused is informed of the charge. A demand for further investigation entitles the accused to recall witnesses for further cross-examination and to offer new evidence in the accused's own behalf.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) It is an affirmative defense in a trial by court-martial that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the accused, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of the acts and therefore lacked mental responsibility. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The accused has the burden, under subsection (1), of proving the defense of lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Whenever lack of mental responsibility of the accused with respect to an offense is properly at issue, the military judge, or the president of a court-martial without a military judge, shall instruct the members of the court as to the defense of lack of mental responsibility under this section and shall charge them to find the accused 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Guilty.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Not guilty.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Notwithstanding section 52, the accused shall be found not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility if a majority of the members of the court-martial present at the time the vote is taken determine that the defense of lack of mental responsibility had been established or, in the case of a court-martial composed of a military judge only, the military judge determines that the defense of lack of mental responsibility has been established.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 51.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Voting by members of a general or special court-martial on the findings and on the sentence shall be by secret, written ballot. The junior member of the court shall count the votes. The count shall be checked by the president, who shall announce the results of the ballot to the members of the court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The military judge shall rule upon questions of law and interlocutory questions arising during the proceedings. A ruling made by the military judge upon a question of law or an interlocutory question other than the factual issue of mental responsibility of the accused, and upon a question of law other than a motion for a finding of not guilty, is final and constitutes the ruling of the court. However, the military judge may change a ruling made by the military judge at any time during the trial.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Before a vote is taken on the findings, the military judge, in the presence of the accused and counsel, shall instruct the court as to the elements of the offense and charge the court as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The accused must be presumed to be innocent until guilt is established by legal and competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If there is a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the accused and the accused must be acquitted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt, the finding must be in a lower degree to which there is no reasonable doubt.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt rests upon this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to a court-martial composed of a military judge only. The military judge of that court-martial shall determine all questions of law and fact arising during the proceedings and, if the accused is convicted, set an appropriate sentence. The military judge of that court-martial shall make a general finding and, on request, shall find the facts specially. If an opinion or memorandum of decision is filed, the opinion or memorandum shall be sufficient if the findings of fact appear in the opinion or memorandum.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 52.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A person shall not be convicted of an offense, except by the concurrence of 2/3 of the members present at the time the vote is taken.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Each sentence shall be determined by the concurrence of 2/3 of the members present at the time that the vote is taken.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Any other question to be decided by the members of a general or special court-martial shall be determined by a majority vote, but the determination to reconsider a finding of guilty or reconsider a sentence, to decrease or lessen the sentence, may be made by a lesser vote which indicates that the reconsideration is not opposed by the number of votes required for that finding or sentence. A tie vote on a motion for a finding of not guilty or on a motion relating to the question of the accused's sanity is a determination against the accused. A tie vote on any other question is a determination in favor of the accused.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 57.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a sentence of a court-martial as lawfully adjudged and approved includes a forfeiture of pay or allowances, the forfeiture may apply to pay or allowances becoming due on or after the date the sentence is approved by the convening authority. A forfeiture shall not extend to pay or allowances accrued before the date of sentence.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A period of confinement included in the sentence of a court-martial begins to run from the date the accused is confined pursuant to the sentence. If a person has been confined before the sentence because the person was unable to furnish a bond for the offense, the court-martial shall specifically grant a credit against the sentence for the amount of time confined before sentencing. A period during which the sentence to confinement is suspended shall not be computed as service of the term of confinement and shall not affect the power of the convening authority to vacate the suspension during the current enlistment of the accused.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Each sentence of a court-martial is effective on the date the sentence is ordered executed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   On application by an accused who is under sentence to confinement that has not been ordered executed, the convening authority or, if the accused is no longer under the convening authority's jurisdiction, the governor may defer service of the sentence to confinement. The deferment shall terminate when the sentence is ordered executed. The deferment may be rescinded at any time by the officer who granted the deferment or, if the accused is no longer under the officer's jurisdiction, by the governor.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A sentence of confinement issued by a court-martial may be carried into execution by confinement in a place allowed by section 10 as designated by the convening authority. A person confined is subject to the same discipline and treatment as a person imprisoned by a civil court of the state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The omission of the words, "hard labor", from a sentence of a court-martial adjudging confinement does not deprive the authority executing that sentence of the power to require hard labor as a part of the punishment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The keeper or officer in charge of a county jail shall receive a person ordered into confinement before trial by the convening authority and a person sentenced to confinement by a military court and shall confine the persons according to law.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Affirm only those findings of guilty, and the sentence or that part or amount of the sentence as the governor or the state judge advocate general finds correct in law and fact and determines on the basis of the entire record should be approved.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Weigh the evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, and determine controverted questions of fact, recognizing that the trial court saw and heard the witnesses.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Order a rehearing if the governor or the state judge advocate general sets aside the findings and sentence, except if the setting aside is based on lack of sufficient evidence to support the findings.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Order that the charges be dismissed if the governor or the state judge advocate general sets aside the findings and sentence and does not order a rehearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Unless the governor is to take further action, the state judge advocate general shall instruct the convening authority to take action pursuant to the state judge advocate's decision on a review.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The state judge advocate general may constitute 1 or more boards of review each composed of not fewer than 3 officers of the organized militia or retired list, each of whom shall be a member of the bar of this state, which board of review shall review the record of a trial by court-martial referred to it by the state judge advocate general. The board of review shall have the same authority and powers on the review of a record as the state judge advocate general has under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   A finding or sentence of a court-martial shall not be held incorrect on the ground of an error of law unless the error materially prejudices the substantial rights of the accused.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   A reviewing authority with the power to approve or affirm a finding of guilty may approve or affirm so much of the finding which includes a lesser included offense.</DIV>
