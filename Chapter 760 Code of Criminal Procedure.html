<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in subsection (3), if a police officer has arrested a person without a warrant for a misdemeanor or ordinance violation, instead of taking the person before a magistrate and promptly filing a complaint as provided in section 13 of this chapter, the officer may issue to and serve upon the person an appearance ticket as defined in section 9f of this chapter and release the person from custody. The appearance ticket issued under this section, or other documentation as requested, must be forwarded to the court, appropriate prosecuting authority, or both, for review without delay.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A public servant other than a police officer, who is specially authorized by law or ordinance to issue and serve appearance tickets with respect to a particular class of offenses of less than felony grade, may issue and serve upon a person an appearance ticket if the public servant has reasonable cause to believe that the person has committed an offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An appearance ticket must not be issued to any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A person arrested for a domestic violence violation of section 81 or 81a of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.81 and 750.81a, or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to a domestic violence violation of section 81 or 81a of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.81 and 750.81a, or an offense involving domestic violence as that term is defined in section 1 of 1978 PA 389, MCL 400.1501.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A person subject to detainment for violating a personal protection order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A person subject to a mandatory period of confinement, condition of bond, or other condition of release until he or she has served that period of confinement or meets that requirement of bond or other condition of release.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A person arrested for a serious misdemeanor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A person arrested for any other assaultive crime.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as provided in subsection (5), a police officer shall issue to and serve upon a person an appearance ticket as defined in section 9f of this chapter and release the person from custody if the person has been arrested for a misdemeanor or ordinance violation that has a maximum permissible penalty that does not exceed 1 year in jail or a fine, or both, and is not a serious misdemeanor, assaultive crime, domestic violence violation of section 81 or 81a of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.81 and 750.81a, a local ordinance substantially corresponding to a domestic violence violation of section 81 or 81a of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.81 and 750.81a, an offense involving domestic violence as that term is defined in section 1 of 1978 PA 389, MCL 400.1501, or an operating while intoxicated offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The police officer may take the arrested person before a magistrate and promptly file a complaint as provided in section 13 of this chapter instead of issuing an appearance ticket as required under subsection (4) if 1 of the following circumstances is present:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The arrested person refuses to follow the police officer's reasonable instructions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The arrested person will not offer satisfactory evidence of identification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) There is a reasonable likelihood that the offense would continue or resume, or that another person or property would be endangered if the arrested person is released from custody.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The arrested person presents an immediate danger to himself or herself or requires immediate medical examination or medical care.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The arrested person requests to be taken immediately before a magistrate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Any other reason that the police officer may deem reasonable to arrest the person which must be articulated in the arrest report.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a police officer determines that 1 of the circumstances under subsection (5) applies and he or she takes an arrested person before a magistrate and promptly files a complaint as provided in section 13 of this chapter instead of issuing an appearance ticket, the police officer must specify the reason for not issuing a citation in the arrest report or other documentation, as applicable, and must forward the arrest report or other documentation, as requested, to the appropriate prosecuting authority for review without delay.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An arrested person who is taken into custody under subsection (6) instead of being issued an appearance ticket must be charged by the appropriate prosecuting authority or released from custody not later than 3 p.m. the immediately following day during which arraignments may be performed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) This section does not create a right to the issuance of an appearance ticket in lieu of an arrest. An arrested person may appeal the legality of his or her arrest as provided by law. However, an arrested person does not have a claim for damages against a police officer or law enforcement agency because he or she was arrested rather than issued an appearance ticket.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Assaultive crime" means that term as defined in section 9a of chapter X.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A judge or district court magistrate may release a defendant under this subsection subject to conditions reasonably necessary for the protection of 1 or more named persons. If a judge or district court magistrate releases a defendant under this subsection subject to protective conditions, the judge or district court magistrate shall make a finding of the need for protective conditions and inform the defendant on the record, either orally or by a writing that is personally delivered to the defendant, of the specific conditions imposed and that if the defendant violates a condition of release, he or she will be subject to arrest without a warrant and may have his or her bail forfeited or revoked and new conditions of release imposed, in addition to the penalty provided under section 3f of chapter XI and any other penalties that may be imposed if the defendant is found in contempt of court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An order or amended order issued under subsection (1) shall contain all of the following: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A statement of the defendant's full name.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A statement of the defendant's height, weight, race, sex, date of birth, hair color, eye color, and any other identifying information the judge or district court magistrate considers appropriate.</div>

With the informed consent of the victim, the court may also order the defendant to provide the victim of the charged crime with an electronic receptor device capable of receiving the global positioning system information from the electronic monitoring device worn by the defendant that notifies the victim if the defendant is located within a proximity to the victim as determined by the judge or district court magistrate in consultation with the victim. The victim shall also be furnished with a telephone contact with the local law enforcement agency to request immediate assistance if the defendant is located within that proximity to the victim. In addition, the victim may provide the court with a list of areas from which he or she would like the defendant excluded. The court shall consider the victim's request and shall determine which areas the defendant shall be prohibited from accessing. The court shall instruct the entity monitoring the defendant's position to notify the proper authorities if the defendant violates the order. In determining whether to order a defendant to wear an electronic monitoring device, the court shall consider the likelihood that the defendant's participation in electronic monitoring will deter the defendant from seeking to kill, physically injure, stalk, or otherwise threaten the victim prior to trial. The victim may request the court to terminate the victim's participation in the monitoring of the defendant at any time. The court shall not impose sanctions on the victim for refusing to participate in monitoring under this subsection. A defendant described in this subsection shall only be released if he or she agrees to pay the cost of the device and any monitoring as a condition of release or to perform community service work in lieu of paying that cost. An electronic monitoring device ordered to be worn under this subsection shall provide reliable notification of removal or tampering. As used in this subsection:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Informed consent" means that the victim was given information concerning all of the following before consenting to participate in electronic monitoring:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The victim's right to refuse to participate in that monitoring and the process for requesting the court to terminate the victim's participation after it has been ordered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The manner in which the monitoring technology functions and the risks and limitations of that technology, and the extent to which the system will track and record the victim's location and movements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The boundaries imposed on the defendant during the monitoring program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Sanctions that the court may impose on the defendant for violating an order issued under this subsection.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) Identification of support services available to assist the victim to develop a safety plan to use if the court's order issued under this subsection is violated or if the monitoring equipment fails to operate properly.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A judge or district court magistrate may release under this subsection a defendant subject to conditions reasonably necessary for the protection of the public if the defendant has submitted to a preliminary roadside analysis that detects the presence of alcoholic liquor, a controlled substance, or other intoxicating substance, or any combination of them, and that a subsequent chemical test is pending. The judge or district court magistrate shall inform the defendant on the record, either orally or by a writing that is personally delivered to the defendant, of all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That if the defendant is released under this subsection, he or she shall not operate a motor vehicle under the influence of alcoholic liquor, a controlled substance, or another intoxicating substance, or any combination of them, as a condition of release.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That if the defendant violates the condition of release under subdivision (a), he or she will be subject to arrest without a warrant, shall have his or her bail forfeited or revoked, and shall not be released from custody prior to arraignment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The judge or district court magistrate shall immediately direct the issuing court or a law enforcement agency within the jurisdiction of the court, in writing, to enter an order or amended order issued under subsection (7) into LEIN. If the order or amended order is rescinded, the judge or district court magistrate shall immediately order the issuing court or law enforcement agency to remove the order or amended order from LEIN.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The issuing court or a law enforcement agency within the jurisdiction of the court shall immediately enter an order or amended order into LEIN. If the order or amended order is rescinded, the court or law enforcement agency shall immediately remove the order or amended order from LEIN upon expiration of the order under subsection (8).</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In all criminal cases where a person has entered into any recognizance for the personal appearance of another and such bail and surety afterwards desires to be relieved from responsibility, he or she may, with or without assistance, arrest or detain the accused and deliver him or her to any jail or to the sheriff of any county.

The notice must be served upon each surety in person, left at the surety's last known business address, electronically mailed to an electronic mail address provided to the court by the surety, or mailed by first-class mail to the surety's last known business address. However, if the notice is served by first-class mail, it must be mailed separately from the notice of intent to enter judgment.

If good cause is not shown for the defendant's failure to appear, the court shall enter judgment against the surety on the recognizance for an amount determined appropriate by the court but not more than the full amount of the bail, or if a surety bond has been posted the full amount of the surety bond.

If the bond or bail is discharged, the court shall enter an order to that effect with a statement of the amount to be returned to the surety.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Subsection (2) does not apply if the defendant was apprehended more than 56 days after the bail or bond was ordered forfeited and judgment entered and the surety did not fully pay the forfeiture judgment within that 56-day period.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in section 4 of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.4, the magistrate before whom any person is arraigned on a charge of having committed a felony shall set a date for a probable cause conference to be held not less than 7 days or more than 14 days after the date of the arraignment, and a date for a preliminary examination of not less than 5 days or more than 7 days after the date of the probable cause conference. The dates for the probable cause conference and preliminary examination shall be set at the time of arraignment. The probable cause conference shall include the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Discussions as to a possible plea agreement among the prosecuting attorney, the defendant, and the attorney for the defendant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Discussions regarding bail and the opportunity for the defendant to petition the magistrate for a bond modification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Discussions regarding stipulations and procedural aspects of the case. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Discussions regarding any other matters relevant to the case as agreed upon by both parties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The probable cause conference may be waived by agreement between the prosecuting attorney and the attorney for the defendant. The parties shall notify the court of the waiver agreement and whether the parties will be conducting a preliminary examination, waiving the examination, or entering a plea.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A district judge has the authority to accept a felony plea. A district judge shall take a plea to a misdemeanor or felony as provided by court rule if a plea agreement is reached between the parties. Sentencing for a felony shall be conducted by a circuit judge, who shall be assigned and whose name shall be available to the litigants, pursuant to court rule, before the plea is taken. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a plea agreement is not reached and if the preliminary examination is not waived by the defendant with the consent of the prosecuting attorney, a preliminary examination shall be held as scheduled unless adjourned or waived under section 7 of this chapter. The parties, with the approval of the court, may agree to schedule the preliminary examination earlier than 5 days after the conference. Upon the request of the prosecuting attorney, however, the preliminary examination shall commence immediately for the sole purpose of taking and preserving the testimony of a victim if the victim is present. For purposes of this subdivision, "victim" means an individual who suffers direct or threatened physical, financial, or emotional harm as a result of the commission of a crime. If that testimony is insufficient to establish probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the charged crime or crimes, the magistrate shall adjourn the preliminary examination to the date set at arraignment. A victim who testifies under this subdivision shall not be called again to testify at the adjourned preliminary examination absent a showing of good cause.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If 1 or more defendants have been charged on complaints listing codefendants with a felony or felonies, the probable cause conference and preliminary examination for those defendants who have been arrested and arraigned at least 72 hours before that conference on those charges shall be consolidated, and only 1 joint conference or 1 joint preliminary examination shall be held unless the prosecuting attorney consents to a severance, a defendant seeks severance by motion and the magistrate finds severance to be required by law, or 1 of the defendants is unavailable and does not appear at the hearing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) At the preliminary examination, a magistrate shall examine the complainant and the witnesses in support of the prosecution, on oath and, except as provided in sections 11a and 11b of this chapter, in the presence of the defendant, concerning the offense charged and in regard to any other matters connected with the charge that the magistrate considers pertinent.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The psychological condition of the victim or witness.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The nature of the offense charged against the defendant.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The desire of the victim or witness to have the examination closed to the public.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whenever by reason of the filing of any complaint, which may be upon information and belief, or upon the application of the prosecuting attorney or attorney general, any judge of a court of law and of record shall have probable cause to suspect that any crime, offense or misdemeanor has been committed within his jurisdiction, and that any persons may be able to give any material evidence respecting such suspected crime, offense or misdemeanor, such judge in his discretion may make an order directing that an inquiry be made into the matters relating to such complaint, which order, or any amendment thereof, shall be specific to common intent of the scope of the inquiry to be conducted, and thereupon conduct such inquiry. In any court having more than 1 judge such order and the designation of the judge to conduct the inquiry shall be made in accordance with the rules of such court. Thereupon such judge shall require such persons to attend before him as witnesses and answer such questions as the judge may require concerning any violation of law about which they may be questioned within the scope of the order. The proceedings to summon such witness and to compel him to testify shall, as far as possible, be the same as proceedings to summon witnesses and compel their attendance and testimony. The witnesses shall not receive any compensation or remuneration other than witness fees as paid witnesses in other criminal proceedings. The witness shall not be employed in any capacity by the judge or by any person connected with such inquiry, within the scope of the inquiry being conducted. Whenever a subpoena is issued by the judge conducting the inquiry, commanding the appearance of a witness before the judge forthwith upon the service of such subpoena, and, following the service thereof, the witness arrives at the time and place stated in the subpoena, the judge issuing the same shall be forthwith notified of the appearance by the officer serving the subpoena, and the judge forthwith shall appear and take the testimony of the witness. Any person called before the grand jury shall at all times be entitled to legal counsel not involving delay and he may discuss fully with his counsel all matters relative to his part in the inquiry without being subject to a citation for contempt. The witness shall have the right to have counsel present in the room where the inquiry is held. All matters revealed to the attorney shall be subject to the requirements of secrecy in section 4, and any revelation thereof by the attorney shall make him subject to punishment as provided in section 4. No testimony shall be taken or given by any witness except in the presence of the judge.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Any judge, prosecuting attorney or special prosecuting attorney, or the attorney general participating in any inquiry under this section which continues more than 30 calendar days shall thereafter be disqualified from appointment or election to any office other than one held at the time of the inquiry. The disqualification shall not extend more than 1 year from date of termination of the inquiry, as determined by final order of the judge entered prior to such date.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 4.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If upon such inquiry the judge shall be satisfied that any offense has been committed and that there is probable cause to suspect any person to be guilty thereof, he may cause the apprehension of such person by proper process and, upon the return of such process served or executed, the judge having jurisdiction shall proceed with the case, matter or proceeding in like manner as upon formal complaint. The judge conducting the inquiry under section 3 shall be disqualified from acting as the examining magistrate in connection with the hearing on the complaint or indictment, or from presiding at any trial arising therefrom, or from hearing any motion to dismiss or quash any complaint or indictment, or from hearing any charge of contempt under section 5, except alleged contempt for neglect or refusal to appear in response to a summons or subpoena. If upon such inquiry the judge shall find from the evidence that there is probable cause to believe that any public officer, elective or appointive and subject to removal by law, has been guilty of misfeasance or malfeasance in office or wilful neglect of duty or of any other offense prescribed as a ground of removal, the judge shall make a written finding setting up the offense so found and shall serve said finding upon the public officer, public board or body having jurisdiction under the law to conduct removal proceedings against the officer. The finding shall be a sufficient complaint as a basis for removal of said officer and the public officer, public board or public body having jurisdiction of removal proceedings against the officer shall proceed in the method prescribed by law for a hearing and determination of said charges. Except in cases of prosecutions for contempt or perjury against witnesses who may have been summoned before the judge conducting such inquiry, or for the purpose of determining whether the testimony of a witness examined before the judge is consistent with or different from the testimony given by such witness before a court in any subsequent proceeding, or in cases of disciplinary action against attorneys and counselors in this state, any judge conducting the inquiry, any prosecuting attorney and other persons who may at the discretion of the judge be admitted to such inquiry, who shall while conducting such inquiry or while in the services of the judge or after his services with the judge shall have been discontinued, utter or publish any statement pertaining to any information or evidence involved in the inquiry, or who shall disclose the fact that any indictment for a felony has been found against any person not in custody or under recognizance, or who shall disclose that any person has been questioned or summoned in connection with the inquiry, who shall disclose or publish or cause to be published any of the proceedings of the inquiry otherwise than by issuing or executing processes prior to the indictment, or shall disclose, publish or cause to be published any comment, opinion or conclusions related to the proceedings of the inquiry, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not more than 1 year or by a fine of not less than $100.00 nor more than $1,000.00, or both fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court, and the offense when committed by a public official shall also constitute malfeasance in office. The limitations, restrictions and penalties relating to the uttering, publishing or disclosing of any statement pertaining to any information or evidence, imposed by this section, do not apply to disclosures of information or evidence made by a judge conducting such an investigation to another judge concurrently conducting an investigation as provided in section 3. Upon the termination of the inquiry if the judge shall make no presentment of crime or wrongdoing as to any person whose apprehension or removal from office he has not so caused, he may, in his discretion, with the consent of the person who may be named, file with the clerk of the county in which such inquiry has been conducted, a report of no finding of criminal guilt as to any person or persons involved in such inquiry, either as witness or otherwise, whose involvement in such inquiry has become public.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   No inquiry or proceeding under this chapter shall continue longer than 6 months unless extended by specific order of the judge or his successor for an additional period not to exceed 6 months.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In the event any judge conducting such inquiry shall be unable to continue because of physical disability, disqualification, termination of office or death, the presiding circuit judge of Michigan shall appoint a successor.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    A judge of a court of record in a state which by law has provided for commanding persons within that state to attend and testify in this state may certify under seal of his court that for purposes of a criminal prosecution in his court or a grand jury investigation in his state, a person in this state is required as a material witness for a specified number of days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Upon presentation of a certificate issued pursuant to subsection (1) to a judge of a court of record in a county where such witness is found, the judge shall fix a time and place for a hearing and make an order directing the witness to appear at the hearing. At such hearing the certificate shall be prima facie evidence of all the facts stated therein.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The judge shall issue a summons with a copy of the certificate attached directing the witness to attend and testify in the court where the criminal prosecution is pending or a grand jury is investigating if he determines at the hearing that:</DIV>

If the judge at the hearing is satisfied of the desirability of custody and delivery, for which determination the certificate shall be prima facie proof of desirability, he may order that the witness be forthwith taken into custody and delivered to an officer of the requesting state without issuing a summons.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a witness, who is summoned pursuant to this section and is paid by an authorized person the sum of 10 cents for each mile of the ordinary traveled route to and from the court where such prosecution or investigation is being held and $5.00 for each day that he is required to travel and attend as a witness, fails without good cause to attend and testify as directed in the summons, he shall be punished in the manner provided for the punishment of any witness who disobeys a summons issued from a court of record in this state.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a defendant in a felony case proposes to offer in his or her defense testimony to establish his or her insanity at the time of an alleged offense, the defendant shall file and serve upon the court and the prosecuting attorney a notice in writing of his or her intention to assert the defense of insanity not less than 30 days before the date set for the trial of the case, or at such other time as the court directs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Upon receipt of a notice of an intention to assert the defense of insanity, a court shall order the defendant to undergo an examination relating to his or her claim of insanity by personnel of the center for forensic psychiatry or by other qualified personnel, as applicable, for a period not to exceed 60 days from the date of the order. When the defendant is to be held in jail pending trial, the center or the other qualified personnel may perform the examination in the jail, or may notify the sheriff to transport the defendant to the center or facility used by the qualified personnel for the examination, and the sheriff shall return the defendant to the jail upon completion of the examination. When the defendant is at liberty pending trial, on bail or otherwise, the defendant shall make himself or herself available for the examination at the place and time established by the center or the other qualified personnel. If the defendant, after being notified of the place and time of the examination, fails to make himself or herself available for the examination, the court may, without a hearing, order his or her commitment to the center.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The defendant may, at his or her own expense, secure an independent psychiatric evaluation by a clinician of his or her choice on the issue of his or her insanity at the time the alleged offense was committed. If the defendant is indigent, the court may, upon showing of good cause, order that the county pay for an independent psychiatric evaluation. The defendant shall notify the prosecuting attorney at least 5 days before the day scheduled for the independent evaluation that he or she intends to secure such an evaluation. The prosecuting attorney may similarly obtain independent psychiatric evaluation. A clinician secured by an indigent defendant is entitled to receive a reasonable fee as approved by the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The defendant shall fully cooperate in his or her examination by personnel of the center for forensic psychiatry or by other qualified personnel, and by any other independent examiners for the defense and prosecution. If he or she fails to cooperate, and that failure is established to the satisfaction of the court at a hearing prior to trial, the defendant shall be barred from presenting testimony relating to his or her insanity at the trial of the case. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Statements made by the defendant to personnel of the center for forensic psychiatry, to other qualified personnel, or to any independent examiner during an examination shall not be admissible or have probative value in court at the trial of the case on any issues other than his or her mental illness or insanity at the time of the alleged offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Upon conclusion of the examination, the center for forensic psychiatry or the other qualified personnel, and any independent examiner, shall prepare a written report and shall submit the report to the prosecuting attorney and defense counsel. The report shall contain:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The clinical findings of the center, the qualified personnel, or any independent examiner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The facts, in reasonable detail, upon which the findings were based.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The opinion of the center or qualified personnel, and the independent examiner on the issue of the defendant's insanity at the time the alleged offense was committed and whether the defendant was mentally ill or intellectually disabled at the time the alleged offense was committed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Within 10 days after the receipt of the report from the center for forensic psychiatry or from the qualified personnel, or within 10 days after the receipt of the report of an independent examiner secured by the prosecution, whichever occurs later, but not later than 5 days before the trial of the case, or at another time the court directs, the prosecuting attorney shall file and serve upon the defendant a notice of rebuttal of the defense of insanity which shall contain the names of the witnesses whom the prosecuting attorney proposes to call in rebuttal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The report of the center for forensic psychiatry, the qualified personnel, or any independent examiner may be admissible in evidence upon the stipulation of the prosecution and defense.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution for a criminal offense that the defendant was legally insane when he or she committed the acts constituting the offense. An individual is legally insane if, as a result of mental illness as defined in section 400 of the mental health code, 1974 PA 258, MCL 330.1400, or as a result of having an intellectual disability as defined in section 100b of the mental health code, 1974 PA 258, MCL 330.1100b, that person lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his or her conduct or to conform his or her conduct to the requirements of the law.

Sections 1004 and 1006 of the mental health code, 1974 PA 258, MCL 330.2004 and 330.2006, apply to the discharge of the defendant from a facility of the department of community health to which the defendant has been admitted and to the return of the defendant to the department of corrections for the balance of the defendant's sentence. When a treating facility designated by either the department of corrections or the department of community health discharges the defendant before the expiration of the defendant's sentence, that treating facility shall transmit to the parole board a report on the condition of the defendant that contains the clinical facts, the diagnosis, the course of treatment, the prognosis for the remission of symptoms, the potential for recidivism, the danger of the defendant to himself or herself or to the public, and recommendations for future treatment. If the parole board considers the defendant for parole, the board shall consult with the treating facility at which the defendant is being treated or from which the defendant has been discharged and a comparable report on the condition of the defendant shall be filed with the board. If the defendant is placed on parole, the defendant's treatment shall, upon recommendation of the treating facility, be made a condition of parole. Failure to continue treatment except by agreement with the designated facility and parole board is grounds for revocation of parole.</div>

Reports as specified by the trial judge shall be filed with the probation officer and the sentencing court. Failure to continue treatment, except by agreement with the treating agency and the sentencing court, is grounds for revocation of probation. The period of probation shall not be for less than 5 years and shall not be shortened without receipt and consideration of a forensic psychiatric report by the sentencing court. Treatment shall be provided by an agency of the department of community health or, with the approval of the sentencing court and at individual expense, by private agencies, private physicians, or other mental health personnel. A psychiatric report shall be filed with the probation officer and the sentencing court every 3 months during the period of probation. If a motion on a petition to discontinue probation is made by the defendant, the probation officer shall request a report as specified from the center for forensic psychiatry or any other facility certified by department of community health for the performance of forensic psychiatric evaluation.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(l)   Carjacking in violation of section 529a of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.529a.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A person convicted of a felony or of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for more than 92 days shall not be sentenced until the court has examined the court file and has determined that the person's fingerprints have been taken.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Unless a juvenile is required to be sentenced in the same manner as an adult under subsection (1), a judge of a court having jurisdiction over a juvenile shall conduct a hearing at the juvenile's sentencing to determine if the best interests of the public would be served by placing the juvenile on probation and committing the juvenile to an institution or agency described in the youth rehabilitation services act, 1974 PA 150, MCL 803.301 to 803.309, or by imposing any other sentence provided by law for an adult offender. Except as provided in subsection (5), the court shall sentence the juvenile in the same manner as an adult unless the court determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the interests of the public would be best served by placing the juvenile on probation and committing the juvenile to an institution or agency described in the youth rehabilitation services act, 1974 PA 150, MCL 803.301 to 803.309. The rules of evidence do not apply to a hearing under this subsection. In making the determination required under this subsection, the judge shall consider all of the following, giving greater weight to the seriousness of the alleged offense and the juvenile's prior record of delinquency:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The seriousness of the alleged offense in terms of community protection, including, but not limited to, the existence of any aggravating factors recognized by the sentencing guidelines, the use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon, and the impact on any victim.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The juvenile's culpability in committing the alleged offense, including, but not limited to, the level of the juvenile's participation in planning and carrying out the offense and the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors recognized by the sentencing guidelines.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The juvenile's prior record of delinquency including, but not limited to, any record of detention, any police record, any school record, or any other evidence indicating prior delinquent behavior.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The juvenile's programming history, including, but not limited to, the juvenile's past willingness to participate meaningfully in available programming.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The adequacy of the punishment or programming available in the juvenile justice system.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The dispositional options available for the juvenile.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   With the consent of the prosecutor and the defendant, the court may waive the hearing required under subsection (3). If the court waives the hearing required under subsection (3), the court may place the juvenile on probation and commit the juvenile to an institution or agency described in the youth rehabilitation services act, 1974 PA 150, MCL 803.301 to 803.309, but shall not impose any other sentence provided by law for an adult offender.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a juvenile is convicted of a violation or conspiracy to commit a violation of section 7403(2)(a)(i) of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7403, the court shall determine whether the best interests of the public would be served by imposing the sentence provided by law for an adult offender, by placing the individual on probation and committing the individual to an institution or agency under subsection (3), or by imposing a sentence of imprisonment for any term of years but not less than 25 years. If the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that the best interests of the public would be served by imposing a sentence of imprisonment for any term of years but not less than 25 years, the court may impose that sentence. In making its determination, the court shall use the criteria specified in subsection (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The court shall state on the record the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law for the probation and commitment decision or sentencing decision made under subsection (3). If a juvenile is committed under subsection (3) to an institution or agency described in the youth rehabilitation services act, 1974 PA 150, MCL 803.301 to 803.309, a transcript of the court's findings shall be sent to the family independence agency or county juvenile agency, as applicable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If a juvenile is committed under subsection (3) or (4) to an institution or agency described in the youth rehabilitation services act, 1974 PA 150, MCL 803.301 to 803.309, the written order of commitment shall contain a provision for the reimbursement to the court by the juvenile or those responsible for the juvenile's support, or both, for the cost of care or service. The amount of reimbursement ordered shall be reasonable, taking into account both the income and resources of the juvenile and those responsible for the juvenile's support. The amount may be based upon the guidelines and model schedule prepared under section 18(6) of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.18. The reimbursement provision applies during the entire period the juvenile remains in care outside the juvenile's own home and under court supervision. The court shall provide for the collection of all amounts ordered to be reimbursed, and the money collected shall be accounted for and reported to the county board of commissioners. Collections to cover delinquent accounts or to pay the balance due on reimbursement orders may be made after a juvenile is released or discharged from care outside the juvenile's own home and under court supervision. Twenty-five percent of all amounts collected pursuant to an order entered under this subsection shall be credited to the appropriate fund of the county to offset the administrative cost of collections. The balance of all amounts collected pursuant to an order entered under this subsection shall be divided in the same ratio in which the county, state, and federal government participate in the cost of care outside the juvenile's own home and under county, state, or court supervision. The court may also collect benefits paid by the government of the United States for the cost of care of the juvenile. Money collected for juveniles placed with or committed to the family independence agency or a county juvenile agency shall be accounted for and reported on an individual basis. In cases of delinquent accounts, the court may also enter an order to intercept state tax refunds or the federal income tax refund of a child, parent, guardian, or custodian and initiate the necessary offset proceedings in order to recover the cost of care or service. The court shall send to the person who is the subject of the intercept order advance written notice of the proposed offset. The notice shall include notice of the opportunity to contest the offset on the grounds that the intercept is not proper because of a mistake of fact concerning the amount of the delinquency or the identity of the person subject to the order. The court shall provide for the prompt reimbursement of an amount withheld in error or an amount found to exceed the delinquent amount.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If the court appoints an attorney to represent a juvenile, an order entered under this section may require the juvenile or person responsible for the juvenile's support, or both, to reimburse the court for attorney fees.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   An order directed to a person responsible for the juvenile's support under this section is not binding on the person unless an opportunity for a hearing has been given and until a copy of the order is served on the person, personally or by first-class mail to the person's last known address.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   If a juvenile is placed on probation and committed under subsection (3) or (4) to an institution or agency described in the youth rehabilitation services act, 1974 PA 150, MCL 803.301 to 803.309, the court shall retain jurisdiction over the juvenile while the juvenile is on probation and committed to that institution or agency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   If the court has retained jurisdiction over a juvenile under subsection (10), the court shall conduct an annual review of the services being provided to the juvenile, the juvenile's placement, and the juvenile's progress in that placement. In conducting this review, the court shall examine the juvenile's annual report prepared under section 3 of the juvenile facilities act, 1988 PA 73, MCL 803.223. The court may order changes in the juvenile's placement or treatment plan including, but not limited to, committing the juvenile to the jurisdiction of the department of corrections, based on the review.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   If an individual who is under the court's jurisdiction under section 4 of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.4, is convicted of a violation or conspiracy to commit a violation of section 7403(2)(a)(i) of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7403, the court shall determine whether the best interests of the public would be served by imposing the sentence provided by law for an adult offender or by imposing a sentence of imprisonment for any term of years but not less than 25 years. If the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that the best interests of the public would be served by imposing a sentence of imprisonment for any term of years but not less than 25 years, the court may impose that sentence. In making its determination, the court shall use the criteria specified in subsection (3) to the extent they apply.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   If the defendant is sentenced for an offense other than a listed offense as defined in section 2(d)(i) to (ix) and (xi) to (xiii) of the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.722, the court shall determine if the offense is a violation of a law of this state or a local ordinance of a municipality of this state that by its nature constitutes a sexual offense against an individual who is less than 18 years of age. If so, the conviction is for a listed offense as defined in section 2(d)(x) of the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.722, and the court shall include the basis for that determination on the record and include the determination in the judgment of sentence.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(14)   When sentencing a person convicted of a misdemeanor involving the illegal delivery, possession, or use of alcohol or a controlled substance or a felony, the court shall examine the presentence investigation report and determine if the person being sentenced is licensed or registered under article 15 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.16101 to 333.18838. The court shall also examine the court file and determine if a report of the conviction upon which the person is being sentenced has been forwarded to the department of consumer and industry services as provided in section 16a. If the report has not been forwarded to the department of consumer and industry services, the court shall order the clerk of the court to immediately prepare and forward the report as provided in section 16a.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Victim" means an individual who suffers direct or threatened physical, financial, or emotional harm as a result of the commission of a felony, misdemeanor, or ordinance violation. For purposes of subsections (2), (3), (6), (8), (9), and (13), victim includes a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, association, governmental entity, or any other legal entity that suffers direct physical or financial harm as a result of a felony, misdemeanor, or ordinance violation. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a felony, misdemeanor, or ordinance violation results in damage to or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the felony, misdemeanor, or ordinance violation or results in the seizure or impoundment of property of a victim of the felony, misdemeanor, or ordinance violation, the order of restitution may require that the defendant do 1 or more of the following, as applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Return the property to the owner of the property or to a person designated by the owner. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If return of the property under subdivision (a) is impossible, impractical, or inadequate, pay an amount equal to the greater of subparagraph (i) or (ii), less the value, determined as of the date the property is returned, of that property or any part of the property that is returned:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The fair market value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction. However, if the fair market value of the property cannot be determined or is impractical to ascertain, then the replacement value of the property shall be utilized in lieu of the fair market value.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The fair market value of the property on the date of sentencing. However, if the fair market value of the property cannot be determined or is impractical to ascertain, then the replacement value of the property shall be utilized in lieu of the fair market value.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Pay the cost of the seizure or impoundment, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a felony, misdemeanor, or ordinance violation results in physical or psychological injury to a victim, the order of restitution may require that the defendant do 1 or more of the following, as applicable:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Pay an amount equal to the cost of psychological and medical treatment for members of the victim's family that has been incurred as a result of the felony, misdemeanor, or ordinance violation. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Pay an amount equal to the cost of actual homemaking and child care expenses incurred as a result of the felony, misdemeanor, or ordinance violation. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a felony, misdemeanor, or ordinance violation resulting in bodily injury also results in the death of a victim, the order of restitution may require that the defendant pay an amount equal to the cost of actual funeral and related services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the victim or the victim's estate consents, the order of restitution may require that the defendant make restitution in services in lieu of money. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the victim is deceased, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the victim's estate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The court shall order restitution to the crime victim services commission or to any individuals, partnerships, corporations, associations, governmental entities, or other legal entities that have compensated the victim or the victim's estate for a loss incurred by the victim to the extent of the compensation paid for that loss. The court shall also order restitution for the costs of services provided to persons or entities that have provided services to the victim as a result of the felony, misdemeanor, or ordinance violation. Services that are subject to restitution under this subsection include, but are not limited to, shelter, food, clothing, and transportation. However, an order of restitution shall require that all restitution to a victim or a victim's estate under the order be made before any restitution to any other person or entity under that order is made. The court shall not order restitution to be paid to a victim or victim's estate if the victim or victim's estate has received or is to receive compensation for that loss, and the court shall state on the record with specificity the reasons for its action. If an entity entitled to restitution under this subsection for compensating the victim or the victim's estate cannot or refuses to be reimbursed for that compensation, the restitution paid for that entity shall be deposited by the state treasurer in the crime victim's rights fund created under section 4 of 1989 PA 196, MCL 780.904, or its successor fund. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Any amount paid to a victim or a victim's estate under an order of restitution shall be set off against any amount later recovered as compensatory damages by the victim or the victim's estate in any federal or state civil proceeding and shall reduce the amount payable to a victim or a victim's estate by an award from the crime victim services commission made after an order of restitution under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If not otherwise provided by the court under this subsection, restitution shall be made immediately. However, the court may require that the defendant make restitution under this section within a specified period or in specified installments. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If the defendant is placed on probation or paroled or the court imposes a conditional sentence under section 3 of this chapter, any restitution ordered under this section shall be a condition of that probation, parole, or sentence. The court may revoke probation or impose imprisonment under the conditional sentence and the parole board may revoke parole if the defendant fails to comply with the order and if the defendant has not made a good faith effort to comply with the order. In determining whether to revoke probation or parole or impose imprisonment, the court or parole board shall consider the defendant's employment status, earning ability, and financial resources, the willfulness of the defendant's failure to pay, and any other special circumstances that may have a bearing on the defendant's ability to pay.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A defendant who is required to pay restitution and who is not in willful default of the payment of the restitution may at any time petition the sentencing judge or his or her successor to modify the method of payment. If the court determines that payment under the order will impose a manifest hardship on the defendant or his or her immediate family, the court may modify the method of payment. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) An order of restitution entered under this section remains effective until it is satisfied in full. An order of restitution is a judgment and lien against all property of the defendant for the amount specified in the order of restitution. The lien may be recorded as provided by law. An order of restitution may be enforced by the prosecuting attorney, a victim, a victim's estate, or any other person or entity named in the order to receive the restitution in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action or a lien.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a defendant shall not be imprisoned, jailed, or incarcerated for a violation of probation or parole or otherwise for failure to pay restitution as ordered under this section unless the court or parole board determines that the defendant has the resources to pay the ordered restitution and has not made a good faith effort to do so.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) In each case in which payment of restitution is ordered as a condition of probation, the probation officer assigned to the case shall review the case not less than twice yearly to ensure that restitution is being paid as ordered. The final review shall be conducted not less than 60 days before the probationary period expires. If the probation officer determines that restitution is not being paid as ordered, the probation officer shall file a written report of the violation with the court on a form prescribed by the state court administrative office. The report shall include a statement of the amount of the arrearage and any reasons for the arrearage known by the probation officer. The probation officer shall immediately provide a copy of the report to the prosecuting attorney. If a motion is filed or other proceedings are initiated to enforce payment of restitution and the court determines that restitution is not being paid or has not been paid as ordered by the court, the court shall promptly take action necessary to compel compliance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) If a defendant who is ordered to pay restitution under this section is remanded to the jurisdiction of the department of corrections, the court shall provide a copy of the order of restitution to the department of corrections when the defendant is ordered remanded to the department's jurisdiction.</div>

<P>Sec. 1b.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    If a juvenile is placed on probation and committed under section 1(3) or (4) of this chapter to an institution or agency described in the youth rehabilitation services act, 1974 PA 150, MCL 803.301 to 803.309, the court shall conduct a review hearing to determine whether the juvenile has been rehabilitated and whether the juvenile presents a serious risk to public safety. If the court determines that the juvenile has not been rehabilitated or that the juvenile presents a serious risk to public safety, jurisdiction over the juvenile shall be continued or the court may commit the juvenile to the department of corrections as provided in this section. In making this determination, the court shall consider the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The extent and nature of the juvenile's participation in education, counseling, or work programs. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The juvenile's willingness to accept responsibility for prior behavior.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The juvenile's behavior in his or her current placement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The juvenile's prior record and character and his or her physical and mental maturity.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The juvenile's potential for violent conduct as demonstrated by prior behavior.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The recommendations of the institution or agency charged with the juvenile's care for the juvenile's release or continued custody.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Other information the prosecuting attorney or juvenile may submit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A review hearing shall be scheduled and held unless adjourned for good cause as near as possible to, but before, the juvenile's nineteenth birthday. If the institution or agency to which the juvenile was committed believes that the juvenile has been rehabilitated and that the juvenile does not present a serious risk to public safety, that institution or agency may petition the court to conduct a review hearing at any time before the juvenile becomes 19 years of age or, if the court has continued jurisdiction under subsection (1), at any time before the juvenile becomes 21 years of age.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Not less than 14 days before a review hearing is to be conducted, the prosecuting attorney, juvenile, and, if addresses are known, the juvenile's parent or guardian shall be notified. The notice shall state that the court may extend jurisdiction over the juvenile and shall advise the juvenile and the juvenile's parent or guardian of the right to legal counsel. If legal counsel has not been retained or appointed to represent the juvenile, the court shall appoint legal counsel and may assess the cost of providing counsel as costs against the juvenile or those responsible for the juvenile's support, or both, if the persons to be assessed are financially able to comply.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The institution or agency charged with the care of the juvenile shall prepare commitment reports as provided in section 5 of the juvenile facilities act, 1988 PA 73, MCL 803.225, for use by the court at a review hearing held under this section. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The court shall conduct a final review of the juvenile's probation and commitment under section 1(3) or (4) of this chapter not less than 3 months before the end of the period that the juvenile is on probation and committed to the institution or agency. If the court determines at this review that the best interests of the public would be served by imposing any other sentence provided by law for an adult offender, the court may impose the sentence. In making its determination, the court shall consider the criteria specified in subsection (1) and all of the following criteria:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The effect of treatment on the juvenile's rehabilitation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Whether the juvenile is likely to be dangerous to the public if released.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The best interests of the public welfare and the protection of public security.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Not less than 14 days before a final review hearing under subsection (5) is to be conducted, the prosecuting attorney, juvenile, and, if addresses are known, the juvenile's parent or guardian shall be notified. The notice shall state that the court may impose a sentence upon the juvenile under subsection (5) and shall advise the juvenile and the juvenile's parent or guardian of the right to legal counsel. If legal counsel has not been retained or appointed to represent the juvenile, the court shall appoint legal counsel and may assess the cost of providing counsel as costs against the juvenile or those responsible for the juvenile's support, or both, if the persons to be assessed are financially able to comply.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   After a sentence is imposed under subsection (1) or (5), the juvenile shall receive credit for the period of time served on probation and committed to an agency or institution under section 1(3) or (4) of this chapter.</DIV>

If the search of the records reveals an arrest for an assaultive crime but no disposition, the court shall contact the arresting agency and the court that had jurisdiction over the violation to determine the disposition of that arrest for purposes of this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Upon a violation of a term or condition of probation, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided in this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An order of probation entered under subsection (1) may include any condition of probation authorized under section 3 of chapter XI, including, but not limited to, requiring the accused to participate in a mandatory counseling program. The court may order the accused to pay the reasonable costs of the mandatory counseling program. The court also may order the accused to participate in a drug treatment court under chapter 10A of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.1060 to 600.1088. The court may order the defendant to be imprisoned for not more than 12 months at the time or intervals, which may be consecutive or nonconsecutive and within the period of probation, as the court determines. However, the period of imprisonment must not exceed the maximum period of imprisonment authorized for the offense if the maximum period is less than 12 months. The court may permit day parole as authorized under 1962 PA 60, MCL 801.251 to 801.258. The court may permit a work or school release from jail.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The court shall enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided in this chapter if any of the following circumstances exist:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The accused commits an assaultive crime during the period of probation. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The accused violates an order of the court that the accused receive counseling regarding the accused's violent behavior.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The accused violates an order of the court that the accused have no contact with a named individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions, the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against the person. Discharge and dismissal under this section must be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of this section or for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime, but it is a prior conviction in a prosecution under sections 81(4) and (5) and 81a(3) of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.81 and 750.81a. There must be only 1 discharge and dismissal under this section with respect to any individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) All court proceedings under this section must be open to the public. Except as provided in subsection (7), if the record of proceedings as to the defendant is deferred under this section, the record of proceedings during the period of deferral must be closed to public inspection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Unless the court enters a judgment of guilt under this section, the department of state police shall retain a nonpublic record of the arrest, court proceedings, and disposition of the criminal charge under this section. However, the nonpublic record must be open to the following individuals and entities for the purposes noted:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The courts of this state, law enforcement personnel, the department of corrections, and prosecuting attorneys for use only in the performance of their duties or to determine whether an employee of the court, law enforcement agency, department of corrections, or prosecutor's office has violated the conditions of employment or whether an applicant meets criteria for employment with the court, law enforcement agency, department of corrections, or prosecutor's office.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The courts of this state, law enforcement personnel, and prosecuting attorneys for either of the following purposes:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Showing that a defendant in a criminal action under section 81 or 81a of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.81 and 750.81a, or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to section 81 of that act has already once  had proceedings deferred under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Determining whether the defendant in a criminal action is eligible for discharge and dismissal of proceedings by a drug treatment court under section 1076(5) of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.1076.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The department of health and human services for enforcing child protection laws and vulnerable adult protection laws or ascertaining the preemployment criminal history of any individual who will be engaged in the enforcement of child protection laws or vulnerable adult protection laws.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this section:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) That term as defined in section 9a of chapter X.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A violation of chapter XI of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.81 to 750.90g.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) A violation of a law of another state or of a local ordinance of a political subdivision of this state or of another state substantially corresponding to a violation described in subparagraph (i) or (ii).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Dating relationship" means frequent, intimate associations primarily characterized by the expectation of affectional involvement. This term does not include a casual relationship or an ordinary fraternization between 2 individuals in a business or social context.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The sentencing guidelines promulgated by order of the Michigan supreme court do not apply to felonies enumerated in part 2 of chapter XVII committed on or after January 1, 1999.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection or for a departure from the appropriate minimum sentence range provided for under subsection (3), the minimum sentence imposed by a court of this state for a felony enumerated in part 2 of chapter XVII committed on or after January 1, 1999 may be within the appropriate sentence range under the version of those sentencing guidelines in effect on the date the crime was committed. Both of the following apply to minimum sentences under this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If a statute mandates a minimum sentence for an individual sentenced to the jurisdiction of the department of corrections, the court shall impose a sentence in accordance with that statute. Imposing a mandatory minimum sentence is not a departure under this section. If a statute mandates a minimum sentence for an individual sentenced to the jurisdiction of the department of corrections and the statute authorizes the sentencing judge to depart from that minimum sentence, imposing a sentence that exceeds the recommended sentence range but is less than the mandatory minimum sentence is not a departure under this section. If the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.1 to 257.923, mandates a minimum sentence for an individual sentenced to the jurisdiction of the department of corrections and the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.1 to 257.923, authorizes the sentencing judge to impose a sentence that is less than that minimum sentence, imposing a sentence that exceeds the recommended sentence range but is less than the mandatory minimum sentence is not a departure under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The court shall not impose a minimum sentence, including a departure, that exceeds 2/3 of the statutory maximum sentence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A court may depart from the appropriate sentence range established under the sentencing guidelines set forth in chapter XVII if the departure is reasonable and the court states on the record the reasons for departure. All of the following apply to a departure:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The court shall not use an individual's gender, race, ethnicity, alienage, national origin, legal occupation, lack of employment, representation by appointed legal counsel, representation by retained legal counsel, appearance in propria persona, or religion to depart from the appropriate sentence range.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The court shall not base a departure on an offense characteristic or offender characteristic already taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence range unless the court finds from the facts contained in the court record, including the presentence investigation report, that the characteristic has been given inadequate or disproportionate weight.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Intermediate sanctions must be imposed under this chapter as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the upper limit of the recommended minimum sentence range for a defendant determined under the sentencing guidelines set forth in chapter XVII is 18 months or less, the court shall impose an intermediate sanction unless the court states on the record reasonable grounds to sentence the individual to incarceration in a county jail for not more than 12 months or to the jurisdiction of the department of corrections for any sentence over 12 months. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If an attempt to commit a felony designated in offense class H in part 2 of chapter XVII is punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year, the court shall impose an intermediate sanction upon conviction of that offense absent a departure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the upper limit of the recommended minimum sentence exceeds 18 months and the lower limit of the recommended minimum sentence is 12 months or less, the court shall sentence the offender as follows absent a departure:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) To imprisonment with a minimum term within that range.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) To an intermediate sanction with or without a term of jail incarceration of not more than 12 months.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a crime has a mandatory determinant penalty or a mandatory penalty of life imprisonment, the court shall impose that penalty. This section does not apply to sentencing for that crime.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) As part of the sentence, the court may also order the defendant to pay any combination of a fine, costs, or applicable assessments. The court shall order payment of restitution as provided by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the trial court imposes on a defendant a minimum sentence that is longer or more severe than the appropriate sentence range, as part of the court's advice of the defendant's rights concerning appeal, the court shall advise the defendant orally and in writing that he or she may appeal the sentence as provided by law on grounds that it is longer or more severe than the appropriate sentence range.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) All of the following must be part of the record filed for an appeal of a sentence under this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An entire record of the sentencing proceedings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The presentence investigation report. Any portion of the presentence investigation report exempt from disclosure by law is not a public record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Any other reports or documents the sentencing court used in imposing sentence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An appeal of a sentence under this section does not stay execution of the sentence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If a minimum sentence is within the appropriate guidelines sentence range, the court of appeals shall affirm that sentence and shall not remand for resentencing absent an error in scoring the sentencing guidelines or inaccurate information relied upon in determining the defendant's sentence. A party shall not raise on appeal an issue challenging the scoring of the sentencing guidelines or challenging the accuracy of information relied upon in determining a sentence that is within the appropriate guidelines sentence range unless the party has raised the issue at sentencing, in a proper motion for resentencing, or in a proper motion to remand filed in the court of appeals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Time served on the sentence appealed under this section is considered time served on any sentence imposed after remand.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A petition under this section shall allege that biological material was collected and identified during the investigation of the defendant's case. If the defendant, after diligent investigation, is unable to discover the location of the identified biological material or to determine whether the biological material is no longer available, the defendant may petition the court for a hearing to determine whether the identified biological material is available. If the court determines that identified biological material was collected during the investigation, the court shall order appropriate police agencies, hospitals, or the medical examiner to search for the material and to report the results of the search to the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The court shall order DNA testing if the defendant does all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Presents prima facie proof that the evidence sought to be tested is material to the issue of the convicted person's identity as the perpetrator of, or accomplice to, the crime that resulted in the conviction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Establishes all of the following by clear and convincing evidence:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A sample of identified biological material described in subsection (1) is available for DNA testing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The identified biological material described in subsection (1) was not previously subjected to DNA testing or, if previously tested, will be subject to DNA testing technology that was not available when the defendant was convicted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The identity of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime was at issue during his or her trial.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The court shall state its findings of fact on the record or shall make written findings of fact supporting its decision to grant or deny a petition brought under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the court grants a petition for DNA testing under this section, the identified biological material and a biological sample obtained from the defendant shall be subjected to DNA testing by a laboratory approved by the court. If the court determines that the applicant is indigent, the cost of DNA testing ordered under this section shall be borne by the state. The results of the DNA testing shall be provided to the court and to the defendant and the prosecuting attorney. Upon motion by either party, the court may order that copies of the testing protocols, laboratory procedures, laboratory notes, and other relevant records compiled by the testing laboratory be provided to the court and to all parties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the results of the DNA testing are inconclusive or show that the defendant is the source of the identified biological material, both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The court shall deny the motion for new trial. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The defendant's DNA profile shall be provided to the department of state police for inclusion under the DNA identification profiling system act, 1990 PA 250, MCL 28.171 to 28.176.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the results of the DNA testing show that the defendant is not the source of the identified biological material, the court shall appoint counsel pursuant to MCR 6.505(A) and hold a hearing to determine by clear and convincing evidence all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That only the perpetrator of the crime or crimes for which the defendant was convicted could be the source of the identified biological material.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That the identified biological material was collected, handled, and preserved by procedures that allow the court to find that the identified biological material is not contaminated or is not so degraded that the DNA profile of the tested sample of the identified biological material cannot be determined to be identical to the DNA profile of the sample initially collected during the investigation described in subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) That the defendant's purported exclusion as the source of the identified biological material, balanced against the other evidence in the case, is sufficient to justify the grant of a new trial.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Upon motion of the prosecutor, the court shall order retesting of the identified biological material and shall stay the defendant's motion for new trial pending the results of the DNA retesting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The court shall state its findings of fact on the record or make written findings of fact supporting its decision to grant or deny the defendant a new trial under this section. Notwithstanding section 3 of this chapter, an aggrieved party may appeal the court's decision to grant or deny the petition for DNA testing and for new trial by application for leave granted by the court of appeals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If the name of the victim of the felony conviction described in subsection (1) is known, the prosecuting attorney shall give written notice of a petition under this section to the victim. The notice shall be by first-class mail to the victim's last known address. Upon the victim's request, the prosecuting attorney shall give the victim notice of the time and place of any hearing on the petition and shall inform the victim of the court's grant or denial of a new trial to the defendant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The investigating law enforcement agency shall preserve any biological material identified during the investigation of a crime or crimes for which any person may file a petition for DNA testing under this section. The identified biological material shall be preserved for the period of time that any person is incarcerated in connection with that case.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) In all prosecutions for felonies, misdemeanors, or ordinance violations other than murder, treason, criminal sexual conduct in the first or third degree, armed robbery, or major controlled substance offenses, if the defendant has been found guilty upon verdict or plea and the court determines that the defendant is not likely again to engage in an offensive or criminal course of conduct and that the public good does not require that the defendant suffer the penalty imposed by law, the court may place the defendant on probation under the charge and supervision of a probation officer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In an action in which the court may place the defendant on probation, the court may delay sentencing the defendant for not more than 1 year to give the defendant an opportunity to prove to the court his or her eligibility for probation or other leniency compatible with the ends of justice and the defendant's rehabilitation, such as participation in a drug treatment court under chapter 10A of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.1060 to 600.1088. When sentencing is delayed, the court shall enter an order stating the reason for the delay upon the court's records. The delay in passing sentence does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to sentence the defendant at any time during the period of delay.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as provided in subsection (5), if a defendant is before the circuit court and the court delays imposing sentence under subsection (2), the court shall include in the delayed sentence order that the department of corrections collect a supervision fee of $30.00 multiplied by the number of months of delay ordered, but not more than 12 months, if the individual is placed on supervision without electronic monitoring. If the individual is placed on supervision with an electronic monitoring device under this subsection, the court shall include in the delayed sentence order that the department of corrections collect a supervision fee of $60.00 multiplied by the number of months of supervision ordered under the delay of sentence, but not more than 12 months. The fee is payable when the delayed sentence order is entered, but the fee may be paid in monthly installments if the court approves installment payments for that defendant. The fee must be collected as provided in section 25a of the corrections code of 1953, 1953 PA 232, MCL 791.225a. A person must not be subject to more than 1 supervision fee at the same time. If a supervision fee is ordered for a person for any month or months during which that person already is subject to a supervision fee, the court shall waive the fee having the shorter remaining duration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) This section does not apply to a juvenile placed on probation and committed under section 1(3) or (4) of chapter IX to an institution or agency described in the youth rehabilitation services act, 1974 PA 150, MCL 803.301 to 803.309.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The court may waive the fee required to be collected under this section if the court determines the supervised individual is indigent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) As used in this section, "electronic monitoring device" includes any electronic device or instrument that is used to track the location of an individual, enforce a curfew, or detect the presence of alcohol in an individual's body.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>771.2 Probation period; extension; eligibility and requirements for early discharge; hearing; reduced probation; registration pursuant to sex offenders registration act; subsection (1) inapplicable to certain juveniles.</B><P>Sec. 2.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in section 2a of this chapter and section 36 of chapter VIII, if the defendant is convicted of an offense that is not a felony, the probation period must not exceed 2 years. Except as provided in section 2a of this chapter and section 36 of chapter VIII, if the defendant is convicted of a felony, the probation period must not exceed 3 years. However, the probation term for a felony under this subsection may be extended not more than 2 times for not more than 1 additional year for each extension if the court finds that there is a specific rehabilitation goal that has not yet been achieved, or a specific, articulable, and ongoing risk of harm to a victim that can be mitigated only with continued probation supervision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as provided in subsection (10), section 2a of this chapter, and section 36 of chapter VIII, after the defendant has completed 1/2 of the original felony or misdemeanor probation period, he or she may be eligible for early discharge as provided in this section. The defendant must be notified at sentencing of his or her eligibility and the requirements for early discharge from probation, and the procedure provided under subsection (3) to notify the court of his or her eligibility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a probationer has completed all required programming, the probation department may notify the sentencing court that the probationer may be eligible for early discharge from probation. If the probation department does not notify the sentencing court as required under this subsection and the probationer has not violated probation in the immediately preceding 3 months, the probationer may notify the court that he or she may be eligible for early discharge from probation on a form provided by the state court administrative office. This subsection does not prohibit the court from considering a probationer for early discharge from probation at the court's discretion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A probationer must not be considered ineligible for early discharge because of an inability to pay for the conditions of his or her probation, or for outstanding court-ordered fines, fees, or costs, so long as the probationer has made good-faith efforts to make payments. However, nothing in this subsection relieves a probationer from his or her court-ordered financial obligations after discharge from probation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Upon notification as provided under subsection (3), the sentencing court may review the case and the probationer's conduct while on probation to determine whether the probationer's behavior warrants an early discharge. Except as provided in subsection (7), if the court determines that the probationer's behavior warrants a reduction in the probationary term, the court may grant an early discharge from probation without holding a hearing. Before granting early discharge to a probationer who owes outstanding restitution, the court must consider the impact of early discharge on the victim and the payment of outstanding restitution. If a probationer has made a good-faith effort to pay restitution and is otherwise eligible for early discharge, the court may grant early discharge or retain the probationer on probation up to the maximum allowable probation term for the offense, with the sole condition of continuing restitution payments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If after reviewing the case under subsection (5), the court determines that the probationer's behavior does not warrant an early discharge, the court must conduct a hearing to allow the probationer to present his or her case for an early discharge and find on the record any specific rehabilitation goal that has not yet been achieved or a specific, articulable, and ongoing risk of harm to a victim that can only be mitigated with continued probation supervision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The sentencing court shall hold a hearing before granting early discharge to a probationer serving a term of probation for a felony offense eligible for early discharge that involves a victim who has requested to receive notice under section 18b, 19, 19a, 20, or 20a of the William Van Regenmorter crime victim's rights act, 1985 PA 87, MCL 780.768b, 780.769, 780.769a, 780.770, and 780.770a, or for a misdemeanor violation of section 81, 81a, or 136b of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.81, 750.81a, and 750.136b, that is eligible for early discharge. If a probationer owes outstanding restitution, the court must consider the impact of early discharge on the payment of outstanding restitution and may grant early discharge or retain the probationer on probation up to the maximum allowable probation term for the offense, with the sole condition of continuing restitution payments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a hearing is to be held under subsection (7), the prosecutor shall notify the victim of the date and time of the hearing and the victim must be given an opportunity to be heard.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The department of corrections shall report, no later than December 31 of each year, to the committees of the senate and house of representatives concerning the judiciary or criminal justice the number of felony probationers who were released early from probation under this section and any available recidivism data.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A defendant who was convicted of 1 or more of the following crimes is not eligible for reduced probation under this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A domestic violence related violation of section 81 or 81a of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.81 and 750.81a, or an offense involving domestic violence as that term is defined in section 1 of 1978 PA 389, MCL 400.1501.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A violation of section 84 of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.84.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A violation of section 411h of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.411h.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A violation of section 411i of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.411i. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A violation of section 520c of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.520c.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A violation of section 520e of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.520e.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) A listed offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) An offense for which a defense was asserted under section 36 of chapter VIII. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A violation of chapter LXVIIA of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.462a to 750.462h, or former section 462i or 462j of that act. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The court shall, by order to be entered in the case as the court directs by general rule or in each case, fix and determine the period, conditions, and rehabilitation goals of probation. The order is part of the record in the case. The court may amend the order in form or substance at any time. If the court reduces a defendant's probationary term under this section, the period by which that term was reduced must be reported to the department of corrections.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A defendant who was placed on probation under section 1(4) of this chapter as it existed before March 1, 2003 for an offense committed before March 1, 2003 is subject to the conditions of probation specified in section 3 of this chapter, including payment of a probation supervision fee as prescribed in section 3c of this chapter, and to revocation for violation of these conditions, but the probation period must not be reduced other than by a revocation that results in imprisonment or as otherwise provided by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) If an individual is placed on probation for a listed offense as that term is defined in section 2 of the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.722, the individual's probation officer shall register the individual or accept the individual's registration as provided in that act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) Subsection (1) does not apply to a juvenile placed on probation and committed under section 1(3) or (4) of chapter IX to an institution or agency described in the youth rehabilitation services act, 1974 PA 150, MCL 803.301 to 803.309.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) As used in this section, "listed offense" means that term as defined in section 2 of the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.722.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The court shall not require a probationer to pay costs under subsection (2) unless the probationer is or will be able to pay them during the term of probation. In determining the amount and method of payment of costs under subsection (2), the court shall take into account the probationer's financial resources and the nature of the burden that payment of costs will impose, with due regard to his or her other obligations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A probationer who is required to pay costs under subsection (1)(g) or (2)(c) and who is not in willful default of the payment of the costs may petition the sentencing judge or his or her successor at any time for a remission of the payment of any unpaid portion of those costs. If the court determines that payment of the amount due will impose a manifest hardship on the probationer or his or her immediate family, the court may remit all or part of the amount due in costs or modify the method of payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a probationer is required to pay costs as part of a sentence of probation, the court may require payment to be made immediately or the court may provide for payment to be made within a specified period of time or in specified installments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a probationer is ordered to pay costs as part of a sentence of probation, compliance with that order must be a condition of probation. Subject to the requirements of section 4b of this chapter, the court may only sanction a probationer to jail or revoke the probation of a probationer who fails to comply with the order if the probationer has the ability to pay and has not made a good-faith effort to comply with the order. In determining whether to revoke probation, the court shall consider the probationer's employment status, earning ability, and financial resources, the willfulness of the probationer's failure to pay, and any other special circumstances that may have a bearing on the probationer's ability to pay. The proceedings provided for in this subsection are in addition to those provided in section 4 of this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If entry of judgment is deferred in the circuit court, the court shall require the individual to pay a supervision fee in the same manner as is prescribed for a delayed sentence under section 1(3) of this chapter, shall require the individual to pay the minimum state costs prescribed by section 1j of chapter IX, and may impose, as applicable, the conditions of probation described in subsection (1), and subject to subsection (11), the conditions of probation described in subsections (2) and (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If sentencing is delayed or entry of judgment is deferred in the district court or in a municipal court, the court shall require the individual to pay the minimum state costs prescribed by section 1j of chapter IX and may impose, as applicable, the conditions of probation described in subsection (1), and subject to subsection (11), the conditions of probation described in subsections (2) and (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The conditions of probation imposed by the court under subsections (2) and (3) must be individually tailored to the probationer, must specifically address the assessed risks and needs of the probationer, must be designed to reduce recidivism, and must be adjusted if the court determines adjustments are appropriate. The court shall also consider the input of the victim and shall specifically address the harm caused to the victim, as well as the victim's safety needs and other concerns, including, but not limited to, any request for protective conditions or restitution.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    A person under 22 years of age who is convicted of a crime in this state for which a sentence in a state prison may be imposed may be required under a probation order to spend not more than 1 year of the probation period, as the court directs, in a probation camp made available to the court by the department of corrections. Admission to a probation camp under this section shall be made only with the prior consent of the department of corrections. The department shall have custody of the probationer for the period the court directs. A probationer fleeing the department's custody may be pursued and recaptured as if the probationer had been regularly committed to a penal institution and had escaped from the institution. A violation by the probationer of the department's rules constitutes sufficient grounds for the court to revoke its probation order and to sentence the probationer for the offense for which he or she was originally convicted and placed on probation. This section does not restrict or limit the court's jurisdiction to place a person on probation in another facility suitable and available to the court. The expense of transporting a probationer to and from the probation camp shall be borne by the county from which the probationer was committed to the department of corrections.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   This section does not apply to a person placed on probation under sections 1(3) and 2(3) of this chapter or to a juvenile placed on probation and committed under section 1(3) or (4) of chapter IX to an institution or agency described in the youth rehabilitation services act, 1974 PA 150, MCL 803.301 to 803.309. </DIV>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>771.3b Special alternative incarceration program.</B><P>
</P>
<P>Sec. 3b.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    In addition to any other terms or conditions of probation provided for under this chapter, the court may require under a probation order that a person convicted of a crime, except a crime specified in subsection (17), for which a sentence in a state correctional facility may be imposed shall satisfactorily complete a program of incarceration in a special alternative incarceration unit, and a period of not less than 120 days of probation under intensive supervision. The special alternative incarceration program shall be established and operated by the department of corrections as provided in the special alternative incarceration act, 1988 PA 287, MCL 798.11 to 798.18. The court also may require the person to satisfactorily complete a local residential program of vocational training, education, and substance abuse treatment, pursuant to subsection (9) or (10).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In order for a person to be placed in a special alternative incarceration program, the person shall meet all of the following requirements:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The person has never served a sentence of imprisonment in a state correctional facility. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The person would likely be sentenced to imprisonment in a state correctional facility. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The felony sentencing guidelines upper limit for the recommended minimum sentence for the person's offense is 12 months or more, as determined by the department. This subdivision does not apply in either of the following circumstances: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The person's offense is not covered by the felony sentencing guidelines. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)    The reason for the person being considered for placement is that he or she violated the conditions of his or her probation. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The person is physically able to participate in the special alternative incarceration program.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The person does not appear to have any mental disability that would prevent participation in the special alternative incarceration program.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Subsection (2)(b) and (c) do not prevent the department of corrections from entering into contracts with counties for participation in the county jail special alternative incarceration program. The county jail special alternative program is a program in which convicted felons who would have been sentenced to a county jail with a sentence of 6 to 12 months can participate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Before a court may place a person pursuant to this section, an initial investigation shall be completed by the probation officer. The initial investigation shall establish that the person meets the requirements of subsection (2)(a) and (b).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   After a person is placed in a special alternative incarceration program, the department shall establish that the person meets the requirements of subsection (2). If the person does not meet the requirements of subsection (2), the person shall be returned to the court for sentencing. The placement of a person in a special alternative incarceration program is conditioned upon the person meeting the requirements of subsection (2). If a person does not meet the requirements of subsection (2), the probation order is rescinded, and the person shall be sentenced in the manner provided by law. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A person shall not be placed in a program of special alternative incarceration unless the person consents to the placement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   In every case in which a person is placed in a special alternative incarceration program, the clerk of the sentencing court shall, within 5 working days after the placement, mail to the department of corrections a certified copy of the judgment of sentence and the presentence investigation report of the person being placed. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Except as provided in subsections (9) to (12), a person shall be placed in a special alternative incarceration program for a period of not more than 120 days. If, during that period, the person misses more than 5 days of program participation due to medical excuse for illness or injury occurring after he or she was placed in the program, the period of placement shall be increased by the number of days missed, beginning with the sixth day of medical excuse, up to a maximum of 20 days. A medical excuse shall be verified by a physician's statement, a copy of which shall be provided to the sentencing court. A person who is medically unable to participate in the program for more than 25 days shall be returned to the court for sentencing pursuant to subsection (5).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   The order of probation under subsection (1) may require that a person who successfully completes a special alternative incarceration program also successfully complete an additional period of not more than 120 days of residential treatment in the local governmental jurisdiction from which the person was committed, beginning immediately upon completion of the special alternative incarceration program, if the local unit of government has created a residential program providing vocational training, education, and substance abuse treatment, designed in whole or in part for persons who complete a program of special alternative incarceration. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   The order of probation under subsection (1) may authorize the department of corrections to require a person who successfully completes a special alternative incarceration program to also successfully complete an additional period of not more than 120 days of residential treatment in a program operated by the department of corrections pursuant to section 4(2) of the special alternative incarceration act, 1988 PA 287, MCL 798.14. A probationer sentenced pursuant to subsection (9) is not eligible for residential treatment pursuant to this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   An order of probation under subsection (1) that requires an additional period of residential treatment upon completion of the special alternative incarceration program shall be considered to be entered pursuant to subsection (9).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   A person who successfully completes a program of special alternative incarceration shall be placed on probation under intensive supervision for a period of not less than 120 days. The period of probation under intensive supervision shall begin upon the completion of the program of special alternative incarceration, unless the person has been ordered to complete an additional program of residential treatment as described in subsection (9) or (10), in which case the period of probation under intensive supervision shall begin upon completion of the program of residential treatment. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   Upon receiving a satisfactory report of performance in the program from the department of corrections, the court shall authorize the release of the person from confinement in the special alternative incarceration unit. The receipt of an unsatisfactory report shall be grounds for revocation of probation as would any other violation of a condition or term of probation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(14)   A term of special alternative incarceration shall be served in the manner provided in the special alternative incarceration act, 1988 PA 287, MCL 798.11 to 798.18. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(15)   Except as provided in subsection (16), a person shall not be incarcerated in a special alternative incarceration unit more than once.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(16)   If a person was placed in a special alternative incarceration program but was returned to the court for sentencing because of a medical condition existing at the time of the placement, the person may be placed again in a special alternative incarceration program after the medical condition is corrected. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(17)   A person who is convicted of any of the following crimes shall not be eligible for placement in the special alternative incarceration program: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A crime described in section 145c, 520b, 520c, 520d, or 520g of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.145c, 750.520b, 750.520c, 750.520d, and 750.520g. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Section 72, 73, or 75 of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.72, 750.73, and 750.75.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   An attempt to commit a crime described in subdivision (a) or (b).</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A county sheriff may notify the court in writing that a prisoner may be eligible for medical probation if the county sheriff has consulted with a physician and the physician determined either of the following: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The prisoner is physically or mentally incapacitated due to a medical condition that renders the prisoner unable to perform activities of basic daily living, and the prisoner requires 24-hour care. The physician shall evaluate when the physical or mental incapacitation arose. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A court shall not place a prisoner on medical probation unless all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A placement option has been secured for the prisoner in the community. A placement option may include, but is not limited to, home confinement or a medical facility.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The court conducted a public hearing in which the prosecuting attorney of the county and each victim who requests notice in the manner provided in the William Van Regenmorter crime victim's rights act, 1985 PA 87, MCL 780.751 to 780.834, are provided adequate notice of the hearing and an opportunity to be heard during the hearing.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, for an offense enumerated in part 2 of this chapter, determine the recommended minimum sentence range as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Find the offense category for the offense from part 2 of this chapter. From section 22 of this chapter, determine the offense variables to be scored for that offense category and score only those offense variables for the offender as provided in part 4 of this chapter. Total those points to determine the offender's offense variable level.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Score all prior record variables for the offender as provided in part 5 of this chapter. Total those points to determine the offender's prior record variable level.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Find the offense class for the offense from part 2 of this chapter. Using the sentencing grid for that offense class in part 6 of this chapter, determine the recommended minimum sentence range from the intersection of the offender's offense variable level and prior record variable level. The recommended minimum sentence within a sentencing grid is shown as a range of months or life.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the defendant was convicted of multiple offenses, subject to section 14 of chapter XI, score each offense as provided in this part.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the offender is being sentenced under section 10, 11, or 12 of chapter IX, determine the offense category, offense class, offense variable level, and prior record variable level based on the underlying offense. To determine the recommended minimum sentence range, increase the upper limit of the recommended minimum sentence range determined under part 6 for the underlying offense as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the offender is being sentenced for a second felony, 25%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the offender is being sentenced for a third felony, 50%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the offender is being sentenced for a fourth or subsequent felony, 100%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the offender is being sentenced for a violation described in section 18 of this chapter, both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Determine the offense variable level by scoring the offense variables for the underlying offense and any additional offense variables for the offense category indicated in section 18 of this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Determine the offense class based on the underlying offense. If there are multiple underlying felony offenses, the offense class is the same as that of the underlying felony offense with the highest crime class. If there are multiple underlying offenses but only 1 is a felony, the offense class is the same as that of the underlying felony offense. If no underlying offense is a felony, the offense class is G.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the offender is being sentenced for an attempted felony described in section 19 of this chapter, determine the offense variable level and prior record variable level based on the underlying attempted offense.</div>
