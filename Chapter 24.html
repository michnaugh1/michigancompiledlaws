<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Rules which became effective before July 1, 1970 continue in effect until amended or rescinded.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   When a law authorizing or directing an agency to promulgate rules is repealed and substantially the same rule-making power or duty is vested in the same or a successor agency by a new provision of law or the function of the agency to which the rules are related is transferred to another agency, by law or executive order, the existing rules of the original agency relating thereto continue in effect until amended or rescinded, and the agency or successor agency may rescind any rule relating to the function. When a law creating an agency or authorizing or directing it to promulgate rules is repealed or the agency is abolished and substantially the same rule-making power or duty is not vested in the same or a successor agency by a new provision of law and the function of the agency to which the rules are related is not transferred to another agency, the existing applicable rules of the original agency are automatically rescinded as of the effective date of the repeal of such law or the abolition of the agency.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Definitions of words and phrases and rules of construction prescribed in any statute that are made applicable to all statutes of this state also apply to rules unless clearly indicated to the contrary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A rule or exception to a rule must not discriminate in favor of or against any person. A person affected by a rule is entitled to the same benefits as any other person under the same or similar circumstances.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The violation of a rule is a crime if provided by statute. Unless provided by statute, a rule must not designate an act or omission as a crime or prescribe a criminal penalty for violation of a rule.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An agency may adopt by reference in its rules and without publishing the adopted matter in full all or any part of a code, standard, or regulation that has been adopted by an agency of the United States or by a nationally recognized organization or association. The reference must fully identify the adopted matter by date and otherwise. The reference must not cover any later amendments and editions of the adopted matter, but if the agency wishes to incorporate them in its rule, it shall do so by amending the rule or promulgating a new rule. The agency shall have available copies of the adopted matter for inspection and distribution to the public at cost and the rules must state where copies of the adopted matter are available from the agency and the agency of the United States or the national organization or association and the cost of a copy as of the time the rule is adopted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A guideline, operational memorandum, bulletin, interpretive statement, or form with instructions is not enforceable by an agency, is considered merely advisory, and must not be given the force and effect of law. An agency shall not rely upon a guideline, operational memorandum, bulletin, interpretive statement, or form with instructions to support the agency's decision to act or refuse to act if that decision is subject to judicial review. A court shall not rely upon a guideline, operational memorandum, bulletin, interpretive statement, or form with instructions to uphold an agency decision to act or refuse to act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a statute provides that an agency may proceed by rule-making or by order and an agency proceeds by order instead of rule-making, the agency shall not give the order general applicability to persons that were not parties to the proceeding or contested case before the issuance of the order, unless the order was issued after public notice and a public hearing.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) When an agency proposes to adopt a rule that will apply to a small business and the rule will have a disproportionate impact on small businesses because of the size of those businesses, the agency shall consider exempting small businesses and, if not exempted, the agency proposing to adopt the rule shall reduce the economic impact of the rule on small businesses by doing all of the following when it is lawful and feasible in meeting the objectives of the act authorizing the promulgation of the rule:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Identify and estimate the number of small businesses affected by the proposed rule and its probable effect on small businesses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Establish differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables for small businesses under the rule after projecting the required reporting, record-keeping, and other administrative costs.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The factors described in subsection (1)(a) to (d) shall be specifically addressed in the small business impact statement. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) 0-9 full-time employees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) 10-49 full-time employees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) 50-249 full-time employees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) For purposes of subsection (3), an agency may include a small business with a greater number of full-time employees in a classification that applies to a business with fewer full-time employees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) This section and section 45(3) do not apply to a rule that is required by federal law and that an agency promulgates without imposing standards more stringent than those required by the federal law.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If an agency finds that preservation of the public health, safety, or welfare requires promulgation of an emergency rule without following the notice and participation procedures required by sections 41 and 42 and states in the rule the agency's reasons for that finding, and the governor concurs in the finding of emergency, the agency may dispense with all or part of the procedures and file in the office of the secretary of state the copies prescribed by section 46 endorsed as an emergency rule, to 3 of which copies must be attached the certificates prescribed by section 45 and the governor's certificate concurring in the finding of emergency. The emergency rule is effective on filing and remains in effect until a date fixed in the rule or 6 months after the date of its filing, whichever is earlier. The rule may be extended once for not more than 6 months by the filing of a governor's certificate of the need for the extension with the office of the secretary of state before expiration of the emergency rule. Any period or extension during which an emergency rule is effective under this subsection is tolled from the date that the environmental rules review committee makes a determination as to a similar rule under section 66(5)(c) until the date a public hearing is held on the rule under section 66(7).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the director of the department of health and human services determines that an imminent danger to the health or lives of individuals in this state can be prevented or controlled by scheduling a substance as a controlled substance under section 2251(4) of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.2251, and the administrator determines that the substance should be scheduled or rescheduled as a controlled substance, the department of licensing and regulatory affairs may dispense with all or part of the procedures required by sections 41 and 42 and file in the office of the secretary of state the copies prescribed by section 46 endorsed as an emergency rule, to 3 of which copies must be attached the certificate of approval and the director of the department of health and human services's notification under section 2251(4) of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.2251. The office shall submit the emergency rule draft language to the legislative service bureau for its formal certification within 7 business days after receipt from the department of licensing and regulatory affairs. The legislative service bureau shall issue a certificate of approval indicating whether the proposed rule is proper as to all matters of form, classification, and arrangement within 7 business days after receiving the submission and return the rule to the office. If the legislative service bureau fails to issue a certificate of approval within 7 business days after receipt of the submission for formal certification, the office may issue a certificate of approval. If the legislative service bureau returns the submission to the office before the expiration of the 7-business-day time period, the 7-business-day time period is tolled until the rule is returned by the office. The legislative service bureau has the remainder of the 7-business-day time period to consider the formal certification of the rule. On receipt from the legislative service bureau, the office shall, within 7 business days, approve the proposed rule if it considers the proposed rule to be legal and appropriate. An emergency rule adopted under this subsection remains in effect until the earlier date of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An identical or similar rule is promulgated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An identical or similar bill is enacted into law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The administrator determines that the emergency rule is no longer necessary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Six months after the date of its filing, which may be extended for not more than 6 months by the administrator on filing a certificate of extension with the office of the secretary of state before the expiration of 6 months after the date of its filing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An emergency rule must not be numbered and must not be compiled in the Michigan Administrative Code, but must be noted in the annual supplement to the code. The emergency rule must be published in the Michigan register under section 8.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the agency desires to promulgate an identical or similar rule with an effectiveness beyond the final effective date of an emergency rule, the agency shall comply with the procedures prescribed by this act for the processing of a rule that is not an emergency rule. The rule must be published in the Michigan register and in the code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) As used in this section, "administrator" means that term as defined in section 7103 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7103.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If an agency finds that preservation of the public health, safety, or welfare requires promulgation of an emergency rule without following the notice and participation procedures required by sections 41 and 42 and states in the rule the agency's reasons for that finding, and the governor concurs in the finding of emergency, the agency may dispense with all or part of the procedures and file in the office of the secretary of state the copies prescribed by section 46 endorsed as an emergency rule, to 3 of which copies must be attached the certificates prescribed by section 45 and the governor's certificate concurring in the finding of emergency. The emergency rule is effective on filing and remains in effect until a date fixed in the rule or 6 months after the date of its filing, whichever is earlier. The rule may be extended once for not more than 6 months by the filing of a governor's certificate of the need for the extension with the office of the secretary of state before expiration of the emergency rule. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the director of the department of health and human services determines that an imminent danger to the health or lives of individuals in this state can be prevented or controlled by scheduling a substance as a controlled substance under section 2251(4) of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.2251, and the administrator determines that the substance should be scheduled or rescheduled as a controlled substance, the department of licensing and regulatory affairs may dispense with all or part of the procedures required by sections 41 and 42 and file in the office of the secretary of state the copies prescribed by section 46 endorsed as an emergency rule, to 3 of which copies must be attached the certificate of approval and the director of the department of health and human services's notification under section 2251(4) of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.2251. The office shall submit the emergency rule draft language to the legislative service bureau for its formal certification within 7 business days after receipt from the department of licensing and regulatory affairs. The legislative service bureau shall issue a certificate of approval indicating whether the proposed rule is proper as to all matters of form, classification, and arrangement within 7 business days after receiving the submission and return the rule to the office. If the legislative service bureau fails to issue a certificate of approval within 7 business days after receipt of the submission for formal certification, the office may issue a certificate of approval. If the legislative service bureau returns the submission to the office before the expiration of the 7-business-day time period, the 7-business-day time period is tolled until the rule is returned by the office. The legislative service bureau has the remainder of the 7-business-day time period to consider the formal certification of the rule. On receipt from the legislative service bureau, the office shall, within 7 business days, approve the proposed rule if it considers the proposed rule to be legal and appropriate. An emergency rule adopted under this subsection remains in effect until the earlier date of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An identical or similar rule is promulgated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An identical or similar bill is enacted into law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The administrator determines that the emergency rule is no longer necessary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Six months after the date of its filing, which may be extended for not more than 6 months by the administrator on filing a certificate of extension with the office of the secretary of state before the expiration of 6 months after the date of its filing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An emergency rule must not be numbered and must not be compiled in the Michigan Administrative Code, but must be noted in the annual supplement to the code. The emergency rule must be published in the Michigan Register under section 8.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the agency desires to promulgate an identical or similar rule with an effectiveness beyond the final effective date of an emergency rule, the agency shall comply with the procedures prescribed by this act for the processing of a rule that is not an emergency rule. The rule must be published in the Michigan Register and the code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) As used in this section, "administrator" means that term as defined in section 7103 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7103.</div>

A notice of intent to use a support person shall name the support person, identify the relationship the support person has with the witness, and give notice to all parties to the proceeding that the witness may request that the named support person sit with the witness when the witness is called upon to testify during any stage of the proceeding. The notice of intent to use a named support person shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding. The agency shall rule on any objection to the use of a named support person prior to the date at which the witness desires to use the support person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   In a hearing under this section, all persons not necessary to the proceeding shall be excluded during the witness's testimony.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The presiding officer that conducts a contested case shall award to a prevailing party, other than an agency, the costs and fees incurred by the party in connection with that contested case, if the presiding officer finds that the position of the agency to the proceeding was frivolous. To find that an agency's position was frivolous, the presiding officer shall determine that at least 1 of the following conditions has been met:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The agency's primary purpose in initiating the action was to harass, embarrass, or injure the prevailing party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The agency had no reasonable basis to believe that the facts underlying its legal position were in fact true.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The agency's legal position was devoid of arguable legal merit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the parties to a contested case do not agree on the awarding of costs and fees under this section, a hearing shall be held if requested by a party, regarding the awarding of costs and fees and the amount thereof. The party seeking an award of costs and fees shall present evidence establishing all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That the position of the agency was frivolous.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   That the party is a prevailing party.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   That a final order not subject to further appeal other than for the judicial review of costs and fees provided for in section 125 has been entered in the contested case regarding the subject matter of the contested case.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The presiding officer may reduce the amount of the costs and fees to be awarded, or deny an award, to the extent that the party seeking the award engaged in conduct which unduly and unreasonably protracted the contested case.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The final action taken by the presiding officer under this section in regard to costs and fees shall include written findings as to that action and the basis for the findings.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Subject to subsection (6), the amount of costs and fees awarded under this section shall include those reasonable and necessary costs actually incurred by the party and any costs allowed by law or by a rule promulgated under this act. Subject to subsection (6), the amount of fees awarded under this section shall be based upon the prevailing market rate for the kind and quality of the services furnished, subject to the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The expenses paid for an expert witness shall be reasonable and necessary as determined by the presiding officer.</DIV>
