However, in any year which, in the opinion of the board, an emergency exists, the board may appropriate a sum not to exceed 2/10 of a mill on each dollar for the purposes of this section. The money, when collected, shall be paid to the county treasurer of the county where the tax is levied in each of the counties in this state, to be paid out by the treasurer upon the order of the soldiers' relief commission if signed by the chairperson and secretary of the commission. If any money in the fund is not necessary for the purpose for which it was raised, the money shall remain in the treasury of the county as a soldiers' relief fund, and shall be considered in raising future sums for this purpose.</div>

<P>Sec. 3.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Administrator of veterans affairs, party in interest. The administrator of veterans affairs, or his successor, is and shall be a party in interest in any proceedings brought under any law of this state for the appointment of a guardian of a veteran of any war or other beneficiary on whose account benefits of compensation, adjusted compensation, pension or insurance or other benefits are payable by the veterans administration, and the said administrator or his successor is and shall be an interested party in the administration of the estate of any such ward on whose account such benefits are payable or whose estate includes assets derived from benefits paid by the veterans administration, its predecessor or successor, and written notice shall be given by (registered) mail unless waived in writing to the office of the veterans administration having jurisdiction over the area in which the court is located, of the time and place for hearing on any petition or pleading or in connection with any proceeding pertaining to or affecting in any manner the administration of the estate of any beneficiary of the veterans administration. Said notice shall be deposited in the mails not less than 14 days or such other period as the court may order prior to the date of such hearings or other proceedings: Provided, That in case of any proceeding or hearing notice of which is not required by the statutes in such case made and provided to be given to the interested parties thereto, either by personal service, mailing or advertisement, notice thereof need not be given to said office of the veterans administration. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Limitation on number of wards. Except as hereinafter provided, it shall be unlawful for any person to accept appointment as guardian of any ward if such proposed guardian shall at that time be acting as guardian for 10 wards. In any case, upon presentation of a petition by an attorney of the veterans administration under this section alleging that a guardian is acting in a fiduciary capacity for more than 10 wards and requesting his discharge for that reason, the court, if it determines that such guardian is acting in a fiduciary capacity for more than 10 wards, shall require a final accounting forthwith from such guardian and shall discharge such guardian in said case.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The limitations of this section shall not apply where the guardian is a bank or trust company. An individual may be guardian of more than 10 wards if they are all members of the same immediate family.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Appointment of guardians. A petition for the appointment of a guardian may be filed in the probate court by or on behalf of any person who under existing law is entitled to priority of appointment. If there be no person so entitled or if the person so entitled shall neglect or refuse to file such a petition within 30 days after mailing of notice by the veterans administration to the last known address of such person indicating the necessity for the same, a petition for such appointment may be filed in any court of competent jurisdiction by or on behalf of any responsible person residing in this state.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The petition shall also set forth the name and address of the person or institution, if any, having actual custody of the ward and the name, age, relationship, if any, occupation and address of the person proposed for appointment as guardian. Notwithstanding any law as to priority, the court may appoint a capable individual, bank or trust company as guardian, if the person entitled to priority fails to apply, or if after hearing the court determines it is to the best interest of the ward to appoint another.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 8.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Before making an appointment under the provisions of this act the court shall be satisfied that the person whose appointment is sought is a fit and proper person to be appointed. Upon the appointment being made, the guardian shall execute and file a bond to be approved by the court in an amount not less than the sum then due and estimated to become payable during the ensuing year. The said bond shall be in the form and be conditioned as required of guardians appointed under the general guardianship laws of this state. The court shall have power from time to time to require the guardian to file an additional bond: Provided, however, That if the person appointed as guardian under the provisions of this act is a trust company organized under the laws of the state of Michigan, or a bank with trust powers organized under the laws of the United States or of the state of Michigan, no bond shall be required except that the court in any case may require a bond from any such guardian if, under the circumstances in a particular case, it feels that such a bond is necessary for the protection of the estate of the ward: And provided further, That in any case where a trust company organized under the laws of the state of Michigan, or a bank with trust powers organized under the laws of the United States or of the state of Michigan, shall heretofore have been appointed guardian under the provisions of this act and shall have furnished bond as such guardian, the court shall have power to cancel such bond and to release and discharge the surety or sureties thereon, upon the written petition of such surety or his principal and after the principal named in said bond has filed an account of all his actions and administration from the date of his last account up to the date of the hearing, if the court, after due notice to all persons interested deems it reasonable and proper.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Where a bond is tendered by a guardian with personal sureties, there shall be at least 2 such sureties and they shall file with the court a certificate under oath which shall describe the property owned, both real and personal, and shall state that they are each worth the sum named in the bond as the penalty thereof over and above all their debts and liabilities and exclusive of property exempt from execution. Notwithstanding such tender, the court may require additional security for or may require a corporate surety bond, the premium thereon to be paid from ward's estate. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Accounting. Every guardian, who shall receive on account of his ward any moneys from the veterans administration shall file with the court annually on the anniversary date of the appointment, in addition to such other accounts as may be required by the court, a full, true, and accurate account under oath of all moneys so received by him, of all disbursements thereof, and showing the balance thereof in his hands at the date of such account and how invested. At the time of the filing in the court of any account, a certified copy thereof shall be by the guardian served by mail on the office of the veterans administration having jurisdiction over the area in which such court is located. A correct copy of any petition or other pleading pertaining to such account or affecting in any manner the ward or his estate shall similarly be so served. The court, unless hearing be waived in writing by the chief attorney of the veterans administration, shall fix a time and place for the hearing on such account, petition, or other pleading, not less than 14 days, nor more than 30 days from the date of said service, unless a different available date be stipulated in writing. Written notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be given the veterans administration office concerned, and the guardian, not less than 14 days before the date of hearing, and may be given by mail.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   When such notice shall have been given as provided herein, any order entered in respect to such account, petition, or other pleading shall have the same effect as if entered after notice by publication as provided in the statutes of the state of Michigan in such case made and provided, and in such case notice by publication shall not be made, unless on order of the court for good cause shown. Upon an attorney for said veterans administration entering his appearance or filing waiver with respect to any such hearing, no guardian ad litem shall be appointed except upon motion by any interested party and for good cause shown.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upon rendering any such account the guardian shall produce for examination by the court, or a duly authorized clerk or other appointee thereof, all securities, evidence of balance on deposit, and investments reported therein, which shall be described in such account in sufficient detail so that they may be identified, and the court or its duly authorized clerk or other appointee shall ascertain whether such securities, balance on deposit, and investments correspond with such account, and if so shall certify to that effect upon the account filed with the court and upon the copy or certificate supplied the veterans administration.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The clerk shall mail said veterans administration office a copy of each order entered in any guardianship proceeding wherein the veterans administration is an interested party.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Commitment of insane veteran. Whenever it appears that any veteran is eligible for treatment in a United States veterans' facility and commitment is necessary for the proper care and treatment of such veteran, the court of the county in which the veteran is found, may, upon receipt of a certificate of eligibility from the veterans administration, and if the veteran be adjudged insane in accordance with law, direct such veteran's commitment to the veterans administration for hospitalization in a United States veterans' facility. Thereafter such veteran upon admission to any such facility shall be subject to the rules and regulations of the veterans administration and the chief officer of such facility shall be vested with the same powers exercised by superintendents of state hospitals for mental diseases within this state with reference to the retention, transfer or parole of the veteran so committed. Notice of such pending commitment proceedings shall be furnished the person to be committed and his right to appear and defend shall not be denied. The commitment of a veteran to a veterans' facility within this state by a court of another state under a similar provision of law, shall have the same force and effect as if such commitment were made by a court of this state.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 16a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Commitment to veterans administration or other agency of United States government.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Whenever, in any proceeding under the laws of this state for the commitment of a person alleged to be of unsound mind or otherwise in need of confinement in a hospital or other institution for his proper care, it is determined after such adjudication of the status of such person as may be required by law that commitment to a hospital for mental disease or other institution is necessary for safekeeping or treatment and it appears that such person is eligible for care or treatment by the veterans administration or other agency of the United States government, the court, upon receipt of a certificate from the veterans administration or such other agency showing that facilities are available and that such person is eligible for care or treatment therein, may commit such person to said veterans administration or other agency. The person whose commitment is sought shall be personally served with notice of the pending commitment proceeding in the manner as provided by the law of this state; and nothing in this act shall affect his right to appear and be heard in the proceedings. Upon commitment, such person, when admitted to any facility operated by any such agency within or without this state, shall be subject to the rules and regulations of the veterans administration or other agency. The chief officer of any facility of the veterans administration or institution operated by any other agency of the United States to which the person is so committed shall with respect to such person be vested with the same powers as superintendents of state hospitals for mental diseases within this state with respect to retention of custody, transfer, parole or discharge. Jurisdiction is retained in the committing or other appropriate court of this state at any time to inquire into the mental condition of the person so committed, and to determine the necessity for continuance of his restraint, and all commitments pursuant to this act are so conditioned.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The judgment or order of commitment by a court of competent jurisdiction of another state or of the District of Columbia, committing a person to the veterans administration, or other agency of the United States government for care or treatment shall have the same force and effect as to the committed person while in this state as in the jurisdiction in which is situated the court entering the judgment or making the order; and the courts of the committing state, or of the District of Columbia, shall be deemed to have retained jurisdiction of the person so committed for the purpose of inquiring into the mental condition of such person, and of determining the necessity for continuance of his restraint, as is provided in subsection (1) of this section with respect to persons committed by the courts of this state. Consent is hereby given to the application of the law of the committing state or district in respect to the authority of the chief officer of any facility of the veterans administration, or of any institution operated in this state by any other agency of the United States to retain custody, or transfer, parole or discharge the committed person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Upon receipt of a certificate of the veterans administration or such other agency of the United States that facilities are available for the care or treatment of any person heretofore committed to any hospital for the insane or other institution for the care or treatment of persons similarly afflicted and that such person is eligible for care or treatment, the superintendent of the institution may cause the transfer of such person to the veterans administration or other agency of the United States for care or treatment. Upon effecting any such transfer, the committing court or proper officer thereof shall be notified by the transferring agency. No person shall be transferred to the veterans administration or other agency of the United States if he be confined upon conviction of any felony or misdemeanor or if he has been acquitted of the charge solely on the ground of insanity, unless prior to transfer the court or other authority originally committing such person shall enter an order for such transfer after appropriate motion and hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Any person transferred as provided in this section shall be deemed to be committed to the veterans administration or other agency of the United States pursuant to the original commitment.</DIV>

An affidavit, executed by the attorney-in-fact or agent, setting forth that he has not or had not, at the time of doing any act pursuant to the power of attorney, received actual knowledge or actual notice of the revocation or termination of the power of attorney, by death or otherwise, or notice of any facts indicating the same, shall, in the absence of fraud, be conclusive proof of the non-revocation or non-termination of the power at such time. If the exercise of the power requires execution and delivery of any instrument which is recordable under the laws of this state, such affidavit, when authenticated for record in the manner prescribed by law, shall likewise be recordable. No report or listing, either official or otherwise, of "missing" or "missing in action," as such words are used in military parlance, shall constitute or be interpreted as constituting actual knowledge or actual notice of the death of such principal or notice of any facts indicating the same, or shall operate to revoke the agency.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The county veteran service fund is created within the state treasury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The state treasurer may receive money or other assets from any source for deposit into the fund. The state treasurer shall direct the investment of the fund. The state treasurer shall credit to the fund interest and earnings from fund investments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Money in the fund at the close of the fiscal year remains in the fund and does not lapse to the general fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The Michigan veterans affairs agency is the administrator of the fund for auditing purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Money in the fund may be used to cover necessary administrative and implementation costs incurred by the Michigan veterans affairs agency, as specifically appropriated from the fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The Michigan veterans affairs agency shall create and operate a grant program that provides grants to counties for allowable expenditures related to county veteran service operations. The Michigan veterans affairs agency shall make grants from the fund, upon appropriation, to each county that enters into a grant agreement with the Michigan veterans affairs agency and meets the conditions listed in subsection (8) for the sole use of supporting allowable expenditures made by the county's veteran service operations. A grant must be disbursed within 60 days after the date that the Michigan veterans affairs agency receives a completed and signed grant agreement from the county requesting the grant. The total disbursement for each grant must be determined by combining the following amounts:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, a base amount of $50,000.00. In a fiscal year when money in the fund is insufficient to support the $50,000.00 base amount, an amount equal to and not to exceed the total amount appropriated to the fund for the fiscal year beginning October 1 divided by 83. A disbursement under this subdivision must be used for 1 of the following purposes:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Establishing new capacity and capabilities for a county to provide veteran service operations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Enhancing and increasing existing veteran service operations through local county offices.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A per capita amount according to the number of veterans residing in each county to support allowable expenditures related to county veteran service operations. The amount in this subdivision must be determined by dividing the amount remaining in the fund after accounting for all disbursements under subdivision (a) by the total number of veterans residing in this state and multiplying the resulting dollar amount by the number of veterans residing in the county receiving the grant. Population figures for veterans residing in this state and in each county of this state must be obtained from the most recent Geographic Distribution of VA Expenditures (GDX) Report published by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the amount remaining in the fund after accounting for all disbursements under subsection (6)(a) is less than the amount obtained by multiplying $1,000.00 by the number of counties receiving grants, the Michigan veterans affairs agency shall not perform a calculation under subsection (6)(b) and shall not disburse the portion of grant funds described under that subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (10), to be eligible to receive a grant under subsection (6) in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2021, and each fiscal year thereafter, by no later than September 30 of each year a county must satisfy all of the following as certified in a form and manner prescribed by the Michigan veterans affairs agency:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2021 and each fiscal year thereafter, maintain at least 70% of the total county funding for veteran service operations for the fiscal year immediately preceding October 1, 2018. If a county reduces the level of county funding for veteran service operations below 70% of the total county funding for veteran service operations for the fiscal year immediately preceding October 1, 2018, the county shall not utilize grant funding awarded under subsection (6) to supplant those reductions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Demonstrate an effort to achieve both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Establish remote access to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs computing systems.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Require county veteran service officers to obtain a PIV card.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Submit quarterly reports to the Michigan veterans affairs agency in accordance with the reporting requirements determined by that agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Provide no less than 20 hours per week toward veteran service operations. Upon request, the Michigan veterans affairs agency may grant an exemption from this requirement. In determining whether or not to grant an exemption under this subdivision, the Michigan veterans affairs agency shall consider necessary information and factors, including, but not limited to, the total veteran population of a county and any existing agreements that promote coordination of services between counties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Submit financial reports to the Michigan veterans affairs agency on a regular basis, as determined by that agency, demonstrating that the county expended the grant funds received under subsection (6) directly and solely for allowable expenditures related to county veteran service operations during the period of the report.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the Michigan veterans affairs agency determines, by audit or otherwise, that a county expended the grant funds received under subsection (6) for purposes other than for allowable expenditures related to county veteran service operations, the Michigan veterans affairs agency shall notify the county of its findings and recover any misused grant funds before issuing any new grants to the county.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Retroactive to the fiscal year ending September 30, 2020, and for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2022, the Michigan veterans affairs agency may suspend the requirements in subsection (8) to allow a county to utilize available money in a county veteran service fund for the purposes of forming an emergent need relief program to provide direct financial assistance through its veteran service operations in the county. In establishing an emergent need relief program, the Michigan veterans affairs agency and counties shall ensure all other available resources are applied before awarding assistance under this program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Accredited veteran service officer" means an individual who has met the qualifications for accreditation under 38 USC 5904 and 38 CFR 14.629.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Allowable expenditures" means those expenditures determined by the Michigan veterans affairs agency to be necessary and proper to support veteran service operations in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "County veteran service fund" or "fund" means the fund created in subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "PIV card" means a personal identity verification card issued by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) "Veteran service operations" means assistance and programming of any kind to meet the needs of veterans in this state. Veteran service operations include, but are not limited to, providing assistance, programming, and services for the purpose of assisting veterans in this state and providing advice, advocacy, and assistance to veterans, servicemembers, dependents, or survivors by an accredited veteran service officer to obtain United States Department of Veterans Affairs health, financial, or memorial benefits for which they are eligible.</div>

The bonds shall be known as veterans' bonds and shall bear interest at a rate or rates not exceeding 2 1/2 per centum per annum, payable semi-annually, shall be in the denomination of $1,000.00 each or any multiple of that amount, shall be payable to bearer and shall mature serially in annual installments of not less than $10,800,000.00 each, beginning 1 year from their date and ending not later than 1968. The bonds may at the discretion of the state administrative board be issued at 1 time in 1 series or from time to time in 2 or more separate series with different dates of issuance for each series, and the state administrative board may from time to time determine and by resolution prescribe, the date of issue of each series, the amount of bonds to be included in the series, the maturities of the bonds so included, the maximum rate or rates of interest on the bonds so included not to exceed 2 1/2 per centum per annum, and the place or places of payment of the bonds. The bonds or any part of the bonds may be made callable prior to maturity upon the terms as may be prescribed prior to the issuance of the bonds by resolution of the state administrative board. Upon the terms and conditions as may be prescribed by resolution of the state administrative board, the bonds may be made registerable as to either principal only or as to both principal and interest or may be converted into registered bonds of the denominations as the state administrative board may authorize, which registered bonds may be reconverted into registered bonds of other denominations or reconverted into coupon bonds. All bonds so presented for conversion or reconversion or payment shall be deposited with the state treasurer, who is hereby authorized and directed forthwith to cancel by perforation and preserve the bond.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The bonds shall be executed for and on behalf of the state of Michigan by the state treasurer and the secretary of state or their deputies and the seal of the state shall be affixed to the bonds by the secretary of state. Interest coupons evidencing accrued interest to the respective dates of maturity of the bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the state treasurer. The state treasurer shall provide a bond register which shall be kept in the office of the state treasurer, in which register shall be recorded the date of each bond, its number, the person or persons to whom originally issued, and the dates of its respective maturity and cancellation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The bonds authorized in this act to be issued shall be sold by the state administrative board, at not less than par and accrued interest. The sale or sales shall be public sales held from time to time at the discretion of said state administrative board after notice by publication at least 7 days before each sale, in a publication printed in the English language and circulated in the state of Michigan, which carries as a part of its regular service, notices of the sale of municipal bonds. The bonds sold at each sale shall be awarded to the bidder whose bid in the opinion of the state administrative board would result in the lowest interest cost to the state. The state administrative board shall have the right to reject any or all bids.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Pending the execution and delivery of the veterans' bonds, there are hereby authorized to be executed and delivered temporary bonds which upon the execution of the veterans' bonds shall be exchangeable for veterans' bonds of like date, tenor, denomination, interest rate and maturity. The temporary bonds shall be printed from type, on steel engraved borders, shall be numbered T1 consecutively upwards, starting with the temporary bonds of earliest maturity, shall be signed and sealed in the same manner as the definitive veterans' bonds, and shall be issued with not more than 2 interest coupons attached to them.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 7a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The jurisdiction of the court of claims is extended to include claims made pursuant to this act. The claims shall have been rejected by the adjutant general as provided by this act. Any claim transferred to the court of claims by the adjutant general shall be a claim accruing from the date of receipt by the court of the claim. The governor by and with the advice and consent of the senate may appoint a commissioner to the court of claims who shall hold office at the pleasure of the governor and who shall be paid a salary as determined by the legislature. The commissioner shall be an attorney licensed to practice law in this state. The commissioner shall assist the court and the applicant in all matters coming before the court by reason of this section. The court by rule shall establish the powers and duties of the commissioner with reference to the claims transferred to the court under this section and may promulgate such other rules as shall facilitate the disposition of claims transferred to it under this section. The fees and the payment of attorneys for services under this section shall be subject to the approval of the court. Expenses incurred under and compensations paid under the provisions of this section shall be paid from funds under this act and the state administrative board is hereby directed to release to the court of claims sufficient funds necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upon receipt of any claim transferred by the adjutant general the court shall forthwith send a notice to the claimant at the last known address of the claimant, by certified mail deliverable to addressee only, that the case has been transferred to the court of claims and that the claimant has the right to a separate hearing or to have the case adjudicated on the record. The notice shall clearly inform the claimant of the time limits placed by this section on his rights to a hearing before the court on his claim or to have his case adjudicated on the record before the court. The notice may also contain such additional information or request for information as the court shall deem necessary or advisable for the expeditious consideration of the claim.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Each notified claimant shall have the right to a hearing before the court upon application made within 60 days after the date of receipt of notice that the case has been transferred to the court. A claimant living outside the continental United States at the time of receipt of the notice shall have 120 days after the date of receipt of the notice in which to make application to the court of claims. Upon failure of claimant to apply for hearing or upon request to determine the claim on the record, the court shall consider and determine the claim upon the record as transferred to the court by the adjutant general together with such additional information as may be furnished under the provisions of this section. If any notice so required to be sent to any claimant is returned undelivered, the case shall be held by the court for a period of 1 year after the date of the return and each claim upon which an action shall not have been taken within that time shall prima facie be deemed to have been abandoned. If, during the 1 year period, the court receives notice of the whereabouts of a claimant, it shall give notice to the claimant, as this act provides, and proceedings shall be had as though the notice was the first notice sent by the court to the claimant. At any time prior to the final determination of any claim, the court may, on its own motion, grant the claimant a hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upon application for a separate hearing, the application, together with the record transferred by the adjutant general, shall be deemed to constitute a petition as required by the court. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The commissioner shall examine the record and shall make a report with reference to the court, including recommendations, if any. The court shall have the right to require of claimants as do not apply for a separate hearing such additional affidavits or depositions, within a reasonably limited time, as it deems necessary for the adjudication of the claim, and the claimants may also, within a reasonably limited time, furnish additional affidavits or depositions in support of their claims.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If the court determines that the claimant is entitled to payment and the amount to be paid, or that the claimant is not entitled to payment, an appropriate order shall be entered and the adjutant general and the claimant notified. Appeal may be had as provided by Act No. 236 of the Public Acts of 1961, being section 600.101, et seq. of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
