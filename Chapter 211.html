</P>
<P>Sec. 2.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   For the purpose of taxation, real property includes all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   All land within this state, all buildings and fixtures on the land, and all appurtenances to the land, except as expressly exempted by law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   All real property owned by this state or purchased or condemned for public highway purposes by any board, officer, commission, or department of this state and sold on land contract, notwithstanding the fact that the deed has not been executed transferring title.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   For taxes levied after December 31, 2002, buildings and improvements located upon leased real property, except buildings and improvements exempt under section 9f or improvements assessable under section 8(h), if the value of the buildings or improvements is not otherwise included in the assessment of the real property. However, buildings and improvements located on leased real property shall not be treated as real property unless they would be treated as real property if they were located on real property owned by the taxpayer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The taxable status of persons and real and personal property for a tax year shall be determined as of each December 31 of the immediately preceding year, which is considered the tax day, any provisions in the charter of any city or village to the contrary notwithstanding. An assessing officer is not restricted to any particular period in the preparation of the assessment roll but may survey, examine, or review property at any time before or after the tax day.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Notwithstanding a provision to the contrary in any law, if real property is acquired for public purposes by purchase or condemnation, all general property taxes, but not penalties, levied during the 12 months immediately preceding, but not including, the day title passes to the public agency shall be prorated in accordance with this subsection. The seller or condemnee is responsible for the portion of taxes from the levy date or dates to, but not including, the day title passes and the public agency is responsible for the remainder of the taxes. If the date that title will pass cannot be ascertained definitely and an agreement in advance to prorate taxes is desirable, an estimated date for the passage of title may be agreed to. In the absence of an agreement, the public agency shall compute the proration of taxes as of the date title passes. The question of proration of taxes shall not be considered in any condemnation proceeding. As used in this subsection, "levy date" means the day on which general property taxes become due and payable. In addition to the portion of taxes for which the public agency is responsible under the provisions of this subsection, the public agency is also responsible for all general property taxes levied on or after the date title passes and before the property is removed from the tax rolls.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In a real estate transaction between private parties in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the seller is responsible for that portion of the annual taxes levied during the 12 months immediately preceding, but not including, the day title passes, from the levy date or dates to, but not including, the day title passes and the buyer is responsible for the remainder of the annual taxes. As used in this subsection, "levy date" means the day on which a general property tax becomes due and payable.</DIV>

Each city and township may publish individually or jointly on or before May 10, 1981, in a newspaper of general circulation, notice of the availability of the exemption affidavit, that these exemption affidavits must be returned by May 22, 1981 in order to be eligible for the reduction of a 1981 property tax bill if Proposal A at the May 19, 1981 special election is approved, and that, if Proposal A at the May 19, 1981 special election is approved, an eligible owner of a homestead who fails to file an exemption affidavit by May 22, 1981 may submit a claim for a refund of taxes paid that were eligible to be exempted with the state department of treasury. The failure to send or receive the exemption affidavit shall not invalidate an ad valorem property tax levy on the property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The state treasurer shall cause to be paid on June 1, 1981 to each local unit required to make a mailing of exemption affidavits pursuant to subsection (2) the sum of 1 of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Thirty cents per exemption affidavit required to be mailed pursuant to subsection (2) if the local unit uses a state supplied exemption affidavit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Thirty-five cents per exemption affidavit required to be mailed pursuant to subsection (2) if the local unit does not use a state supplied exemption affidavit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Each local unit required to make a mailing of exemption affidavits pursuant to subsection (2) shall submit a reimbursement claim to the state treasurer by May 15, 1981 for the expenses described in subsection (3) related to this required mailing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   On or before June 8, 1981, each local property tax collecting unit that is required to mail exemption affidavits shall submit a reimbursement claim of $1.00 for each homestead on which ad valorem property taxes will be exempt from collection under the exemption provided by section 3 of article 9 of the state constitution of 1963, as amended by the voters on May 19, 1981. If more than 1 local treasurer collects ad valorem property taxes in the same calendar year on a homestead for which a claim is submitted under this subsection, each local property tax collecting unit which does not receive the $1.00 per homestead reimbursement under this subsection, shall submit, on or before June 8, 1981 for each of these local property tax collecting units that collect a summer tax levy and on or before November 1, 1981 for each of these local property tax collecting units that collect a winter tax levy, a reimbursement claim of 10 cents for each homestead on which ad valorem property taxes will be exempt from collection under the exemption provided by section 3 of article 9 of the state constitution of 1963, as amended by the voters on May 19, 1981. The state treasurer shall require disbursements to be made by June 20, 1981 if the claim is required on or before June 8, 1981 or by November 20, 1981 if the claim is required on or before November 1, 1981, for the amount of the qualified claims submitted under this subsection, which amount shall be for the necessary costs of implementation of the exemptions provided by the exemption provided by section 3 of article 9 of the state constitution of 1963, as amended by the voters on May 19, 1981.</DIV>

  <p><BR><B>History:</B> Add. 1981, Act 6, Imd. Eff. Apr. 16, 1981 <BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> Section 2 of Act 6 of 1981 provides: “Section 7a(5) and (6) shall take effect on the date the state board of canvassers certifies to the secretary of state that Proposal A on the statewide May 19,1981 special election ballot has been approved by the voters.”Section 3 of Act 6 of 1981 provides: “Sections 7a(1), (2), (5), and (6), 34d(13), and 44a shall expire on the date the state board of canvassers certifies to the secretary of state that Proposal A on the statewide May 19, 1981 special election ballot has been rejected by the voters.”Proposal A, referred to in Sections 2 and 3 of Act 6 of 1981, was submitted to and disapproved by the people at the special election held on May 19, 1981. The state board of canvassers, also referred to in Sections 2 and 3, certified to the secretary of state on May 27, 1981, that Proposal A had been rejected by the voters.Sec. 7a, as added by Act 6 of 1981 , was amended by Act 41 of 1981 to read as follows:“Sec. 7a.(1) After application of section 34d, the remaining ad valorem property taxes imposed for operating purposes pursuant to this act on the homestead of an individual who is a resident of this state which is subject to assessment, equalization, and the levy of a tax pursuant to this act shall be exempt from collection in an amount equal to 50% of the taxes imposed for operating purposes upon the homestead up to a maximum of $1,400.00 as adjusted pursuant to subsection (6).“(2) As used in this section:“(a) “Exemption affidavit” means the form prescribed pursuant to subsection (5) by the department of treasury upon which the owner certifies that the property is the homestead of the owner.“(b) “Domicile” means a place where an individual has his or her true, fixed, and permanent home, to which, whenever absent therefrom, the individual intends to return.“(c) “Homestead” means a dwelling or a unit in a multipurpose or multidwelling building, which is subject to ad valorem taxes and which is owned and occupied as the principal domicile by the owner thereof. A homestead shall include a portion of cooperatively owned housing in which a person is residing, if the cooperatively owned housing is owned either by a nonprofit cooperative organization or by a cooperative organization in which more than 50% of the organization's shares are owned by occupants in the organization's cooperatively owned housing.“When a homestead is located on leased land and is listed as personal property on the assessment roll, or is an integral part of a larger unit of assessment such as commercial, industrial, developmental, residential, timber cutover, or a multipurpose or multidwelling building, the tax on the homestead shall be the same proportion of the total property tax as the proportion of the value of the homestead is to the total value of the assessed property. A homestead shall include all of the adjacent and contiguous unoccupied real property not classified for ad valorem property tax purposes as agricultural and all unoccupied real property classified for ad valorem tax purposes as agricultural, regardless of whether the owner of this property also is the owner of a domicile, except that, if the gross receipts of the agricultural or horticultural operations in the previous year or the average annual gross receipts in the previous 3 years do not exceed the household income of the owner in the previous year, or if there are no gross receipts in the previous year, all of the adjacent and contiguous unoccupied agricultural or horticultural lands shall be considered a homestead.“(d) “Household income” means that term as defined by section 508(4) of Act No. 281 of the Public Acts of 1967, as amended, being section 206.508 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.“(e) “Owner” means the holder of legal title, except that if the holder of legal title is also a land contract vendor for the property the owner shall be the most recent land contract vendee, or if the holder of legal title is an estate or a trust, the owner shall be the beneficiary of the estate or trust.“(f) “Taxes imposed for operating purposes” means all ad valorem property taxes other than ad valorem property taxes specifically levied to repay the principal and interest due on the following types of obligations of the unit of local government.“(i) A bond or note issued to fund capital expenses that is subject to or incurred pursuant to the procedures or authorization of Act No. 202 of the Public Acts of 1943, as amended, being sections 131.1 to 138.2 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.“(ii) A bond or note, other than a judgment obligation or a tax anticipation note, issued to fund past or future operating expenses, if and to the extent ad valorem property taxes levied to repay principal and interest are in addition to charter or statutory limitations as authorized by section 1a of Chapter VII of Act No. 202 of the Public Acts of 1943, as amended, being section 137.1a of the Michigan Compiled Laws.“(3)  Except as provided by subsections (4) and (9), to qualify to receive the benefit of the exemption provided by subsection (1) reflected in a reduction in a tax bill a taxpayer eligible to elect an exemption under subsection (1) annually shall file an exemption affidavit, which shall be included with or as part of the assessment notice under section 24c, on or before April 15 or a later date specified by the local tax collecting unit, with the local official designated by the taxpayer's tax collecting unit. A local tax collecting unit shall not reduce pursuant to this section the ad valorem property tax levy against a piece of property for which an exemption affidavit is filed if the local tax collecting unit has knowledge that the property does not qualify for an exemption under this section. The failure of an individual to receive or of the unit of local government to send the exemption affidavit shall not invalidate an ad valorem property tax levy on the property.“(4)  If a tax payer who is eligible to receive the benefit of an exemption under subsection (1) fails to make a timely filing of an exemption affidavit pursuant to subsection (3) or (9), the taxpayer may file for an exemption refund from the department of treasury for the amount of tax levied that was eligible for exemption. A filing may be made pursuant to this subsection within 4 years after the December 31 which follows the date on which the tax was due and payable. The department of treasury shall refund to a qualified taxpayer the tax levied that was eligible for exemption less any amount allowed the taxpayer as an income tax credit under section 520 of Act No. 281 of the Public Acts of 1967, as amended, being section 206.520 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, for the year for which an exemption refund is filed in excess of the income tax credit for that year under section 520 of Act No. 281 of the Public Acts of 1967, as amended, calculated using property taxes as reduced by the amount of the exemption refund for that year. An exemption refund made by the department of treasury under this subsection or subsection (9) shall be considered a refund to an individual who, by paying the tax eligible for exemption, has made a payment or return of a reimbursement to units of local government on behalf of the state for the exemption provided by this section.“(5)  The department of treasury shall prescribe the information required on the exemption affidavit to each assessing officer and shall prepare sample exemption affidavits. The information which shall be required on an exemption affidavit shall include the name and address of the owner of the property, an identification of whether the property is an integral part of a larger assessment unit or of a multipurpose or multidwelling building, the social security numbers of the owner who signs the exemption affidavit and each resident in the homestead with an ownership interest, an identification by address or legal description of the property for which the exemption affidavit is filed, the parcel identification number, and a statement requiring the signature of the owner to certify that the property qualified for the exemption provided by this section. In 1982 and each year thereafter the assessing officer shall mail the exemption affidavit with or as part of the notice required by section 24c. Exemption affidavits shall also be made available at each local unit of government. “(6)  The maximum amount of taxes which may be exempt under subsection (1) shall be adjusted by the state tax commission on the second Monday in May in 1982 and each year thereafter, pursuant to the percentage increase or decrease in the state equalized value of property in this state, excluding new construction and improvements, classified as residential and agricultural real property. The adjustment shall be made by multiplying the percentage increase or decrease in the state equalized value of property in this state, excluding new construction and improvements, classified as residential and agricultural real property by the amount of the prior year's maximum tax exemption. The resultant product shall be added to the prior year's maximum tax exemption and then rounded down to the nearest multiple of $10.00. This figure shall be the new maximum amount of taxes which may be exempt for tax levies in the then current calendar year and shall be certified to the treasurer of each unit of local government by the state tax commission.“(7)  An individual who files an exemption affidavit pursuant to subsection (3) or (9) for purposes of exempting taxes on the individual's homestead from collection shall not be qualified either to file for another exemption affidavit pursuant to subsection (3) or (9) for tax levies in the same calendar year or to file for an exemption refund pursuant to subsection (4) for tax levies in the same calendar year. Upon filing of a qualified exemption affidavit pursuant to subsection (3) or (9) the taxes on the homestead to which the exemption affidavit applied shall be eligible for the exemption from collection provided by subsection (1) for tax levies in the year the qualified exemption affidavit was filed, regardless of any subsequent transfer, sale, or use of the property in that year.“(8)  A person who knowingly files an exemption affidavit pursuant to subsection (3) or (9) or an application for a refund under subsection (4) for tax levies in the same calendar year for more than 1 homestead, or who knowingly files an exemption affidavit pursuant to subsection (3) or (9) or an application for a refund under subsection (4) for which the taxpayer is not qualified or eligible, is guilty of a misdemeanor. A person who files, with an intent to defraud, an exemption affidavit pursuant to subsection (3) or (9) or an application for a refund under subsection (4) either for tax levies in the same calendar year for more than 1 homestead, or for a refund or exemption for which the person is not qualified or eligible, is guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or a fine of not more than $5,000.00, or both.“(9)  Each city and township shall cause to be mailed, on or before May 1, 1981, an exemption affidavit to the occupant of each piece of property within the city or township which is classified as residential or agricultural property and, if determinable by the city or township, which contains a dwelling suitable for occupancy. In order to receive the benefit of an exemption provided by subsection (1) reflected as a reduction in their 1981 ad valorem property tax bill, an individual's exemption affidavit shall be returned on or before May 22, 1981, or a later date specified by the city or township, to the local official of the city or township who shall be designated on the exemption affidavit. Exemption affidavits shall also be made available at each local unit of government after April 30, 1981. Each city and township may publish individually or jointly on or before May 10, 1981, in a newspaper of general circulation, notice of the availability of the exemption affidavit, that these exemption affidavits must be returned by May 22, 1981 or the later date specified by the city or township in order to be eligible for the reduction of a 1981 property tax bill if Proposal A at the May 19, 1981 special election is approved, and that, if Proposal A at the May 19, 1981 special election is approved, an eligible owner of a homestead who fails to file an exemption affidavit by May 22, 1981 or the later date specified by the city or township may submit a claim for a refund of taxes paid that were eligible to be exempted with the state department of treasury. The failure to send or receive the exemption affidavit shall not invalidate an ad valorem property tax levy on the property. For ad valorem property tax levies in 1981 and each year thereafter, if an exemption affidavit includes an identification of the property as a unit in cooperatively owned housing, or as an integral part of a larger assessment unit or of a multipurpose or multidwelling building, the local tax collecting unit that received the exemption affidavit shall either determine that portion of the property which is considered a homestead under this section or, if the property is a unit in cooperatively owned housing, solicit additional information from the individual filing the exemption affidavit of that portion of the ad valorem property taxes to be levied in the calendar year against the cooperatively owned housing which will be attributed to the unit for which the individual files an exemption affidavit. After determination or receipt of this information the local tax collecting unit shall either make the appropriate reduction of ad valorem taxes against the property, or, if this determination cannot be made, or if this information is not received, by a date timely enough to allow for the reduction of the property tax bill, certify the amount of taxes eligible for exemption to the state treasurer. The state treasurer shall issue an exemption refund to the individual who filed a qualified exemption affidavit in the amount certified by the local tax collecting unit. In place of the procedures established by this subsection for the filing of exemption affidavits for, and solicitation of determinations of ownership interests for, a homestead which is a unit in cooperatively owned housing the department of treasury may provide for a unitary filing of exemption affidavits, and for the submission of exemption refund claims, for each eligible homestead in the cooperatively owned housing by a cooperative organization on behalf of, but signed by, the occupant of the cooperatively owned housing who is eligible to receive benefit of an exemption under this section.“(10)  A local unit of government shall adjust its subsequent ad valorem property tax levy against a piece of property to collect the value of an exemption which was deducted from the preceding tax levy against the property and not reimbursed by the state pursuant to the authority of section 9(1) of the local tax relief fund act. Upon request of the department of treasury and if ownership of the property has not changed since the tax levy for which an unqualified exemption was applied, a unit of local government shall adjust its subsequent ad valorem property tax levy against a piece of property to collect the value of an unqualified exemption which was deducted from a preceding property tax levy against the property. The additional ad valorem property taxes levied and collected by application of these adjustments for previously applied unqualified exemptions shall be remitted to the state treasurer.“(11)  If a homestead is located both within a city and a township or in more than 1 city, township, county, or school district and if the portion of the homestead upon which the domicile of the owner is located is within a taxing unit which collects ad valorem property tax at the same time that the analogous taxing unit or units collects from the balance of the homestead, the maximum exemption available under this section shall be allocated in a manner which allows it to be applied first against the applicable property tax levies for each taxing unit where the domicile of the owner of the homestead is located, and any unused portion then shall be applied, to the extent allowed by this section, against the applicable property tax levies for the analogous taxing unit or units in which the remainder of the homestead is located. If different local treasurers collect ad valorem property tax levies in the same year and on the same property, the local tax collecting treasurer for an ad valorem property tax levy on property against which another ad valorem property tax levy is also imposed shall forward the information contained in each exemption affidavit filed in the year for these properties, along with a notation for each homestead of the amount of tax that was exempted from collection pursuant to this section with the applicable ad valorem property tax levy, to each other local tax collecting treasurer who collects ad valorem property tax levies on the same property in that year. If property for which an exemption affidavit is filed has ad valorem property tax levies against it in the same year collected by a village treasurer, each township that receives exemption affidavits for these properties shall forward, by June 1 of each year, the information contained in each exemption affidavit filed in the year for these properties to the village treasurer. A local tax collecting treasurer who collects summer levies of ad valorem property taxes for operating purposes may apply a prorated portion of the maximum exemption allowed by this section for the year, as adjusted pursuant to subsection (6), against the summer property tax levies. This prorated portion shall be the same portion that the actual summer ad valorem property tax levy for operating purposes bears to the total actual summer and winter property tax levies for operating purposes in the year. If the actual winter property tax levy for operating purposes in the year is not known, the winter levy of ad valorem property taxes for operating purposes in the immediately preceding year may be used in determining the proportion. If the local tax collecting treasurer who collects summer ad valorem property taxes decides to use a prorated portion of the maximum exemption allowed by this section in determining the exemption applied against the summer property tax levies, this prorated portion shall be again prorated among each unit of local government for which the local tax collecting treasurer collects a summer levy according to the percentage that the actual summer ad valorem property tax levy for operating purposes for each respective taxing unit bears to the aggregate actual summer ad valorem property tax levies for operating purposes for the respective taxing units.“(12)  In 1981 only each local tax collecting treasurer that receives from a financial institution an identification of properties from which the local tax collecting treasurer collects ad valorem property taxes and for which the financial institution has established an escrow account for purposes of paying ad valorem property tax, shall forward at 1 time on or before July 1, 1981 to the financial institution an identification of each property identified by the financial institution for which an exemption affidavit has been filed and for which the exemption from collection provided by this section will apply and be reflected as a reduction in the tax bill.“(13)  The state treasurer shall cause to be paid on June 1, 1981 to each local unit required to make a mailing of exemption affidavits pursuant to subsection (9) the sum of 1 of the following:“(a) Thirty cents per exemption affidavit required to be mailed pursuant to subsection (9) if the local unit uses a state supplied exemption affidavit.“(b)  Thirty-five cents per exemption affidavit required to be mailed pursuant to subsection (9) if the local unit does not use a state supplied exemption affidavit. “(14) Each local unit required to make a mailing of exemption affidavits pursuant to subsection (9) shall submit a reimbursement claim to the state treasurer by May 15, 1981 for the expenses described in subsection (13) related to this required mailing.”Section 2 of Act 41 of 1981 provides:“(1) Except as provided by subsections (2) and (3), this amendatory act shall not take effect unless House Joint Resolution G of the 81st Legislature becomes a part of the constitution as provided in section 1 of article 12 of the state constitution of 1963.“(2)  Section 7a(8), (9), (12), (13), and (14) of this amendatory act shall take immediate effect, but shall expire on the date the state board of canvassers certifies to the secretary of state that Proposal A on the statewide May 19, 1981 special election ballot has been rejected by the voters.“(3)  Sections 7a(11) and 34d(3), (4), (7), (9), (10), (11), (17), and (18) of this amendatory act shall take effect on the date the state board of canvassers certifies to the secretary of state that Proposal A on the statewide May 19, 1981 special election ballot has been approved by the voters.”Proposal A, referred to in Sections 2 and 3 of Act 41 of 1981, was submitted to and disapproved by the people at the special election held on May 19, 1981. The state board of canvassers, also referred to in Sections 2 and 3, certified to the secretary of state on May 27, 1981, that Proposal A had been rejected by the voters.Former MCL 211.7a, pertaining to real estate used and owned as homestead by blind person, was repealed by Act 20 of 1973.<BR><B>Popular Name:</B> Act 206</p>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Real property used and owned as a homestead by either of the following individuals is exempt from the collection of taxes under this act: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A disabled veteran.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A surviving spouse of a disabled veteran who, immediately before death, was eligible for the exemption under this section. An exemption under this subdivision continues as long as the surviving spouse does not remarry, and the exemption applies to any property used and owned as a homestead by the surviving spouse, including homestead property acquired after the decedent's death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) To obtain the exemption, an individual described in subsection (1)(a) or (b), or the individual's legal designee, must file an application, in a form and manner prescribed by the state tax commission, showing the facts required by this section and a description of the real property with the assessing officer for the local assessing unit after January 1 and before December 31 of the calendar year for which the exemption is claimed. The application when filed is open to inspection. The taxes subject to collection under this act shall be canceled for any year in which an individual described in subsection (1)(a) or (b) who is eligible for the exemption under this section has acquired title to real property exempt under this section.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An exemption once granted applies to all property taxes for the current tax year that have been paid by the individual who qualified for the exemption under subsection (1)(a) or (b) and all property taxes for the current tax year that would have been owed by that individual if the property was not exempt. If the individual who qualified for the exemption under subsection (1)(a) or (b) does not use and own the property as a homestead for the entire tax year, the exemption must be prorated under 1 of the following methods:</div>

The local treasurer shall use the closing or other purchase documents when calculating the amount of taxes to be exempted. There must be no refund of any property taxes not levied in the current tax year paid pursuant to the closing or other purchase documents to the seller by the individual who qualified for the exemption under subsection (1)(a) or (b).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If closing or other purchase documents are not provided for the proration under subdivision (a), based on a proration under which the local treasurer calculates the amount of property taxes levied in the current tax year to be exempted by dividing the total property taxes levied in the year by 365 and then multiplying that number by the number of days the individual will use and own the property as a homestead.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Based on a proration that takes into account the effective date of any removal of the exemption, which the assessor shall designate as the date of the relevant conveyance or disposition. Using that date, the local treasurer shall calculate the amount of property taxes levied in the current tax year to be exempted by dividing the total property taxes levied in the year by 365 and then multiplying that number by the number of days the individual, while qualified for the exemption, used and owned the property as a homestead.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>An exemption granted under section 7b as to taxes levied on or after January 1, 2025 remains in effect, without subsequent reapplication, until it is rescinded by the individual who was granted the exemption or is denied by the assessor, as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The individual shall file with the local assessing unit, in a form and manner prescribed by the state tax commission, a form rescinding the exemption within 45 days after the occurrence of either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The individual ceases to use and own as a homestead the property for which the exemption was granted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The individual no longer meets the qualifications under section 7b to receive the exemption.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A local assessing unit shall implement an audit program, in a form and manner prescribed by the state tax commission, that includes, but is not limited to, the audit of all information filed under section 7b(2). The audit must not occur on a property more than once every 3 years unless there is a reasonable belief that the property is ineligible for the exemption. If property is determined to be ineligible for exemption as a result of an audit, the individual who was granted the exemption under section 7b is subject to repayment of additional taxes including interest to be paid as provided in subdivisions (c) and (d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The assessor may deny a new claim, or an existing claim following an audit, as further provided in subdivision (d).</div>

The assessor may deny a claim for exemption for the current year and for the 3 immediately preceding calendar years. If the tax roll is in the local tax collecting unit's possession, it shall amend the tax roll to reflect the removal of the exemption, and the local treasurer shall, within 30 days after the date of the discovery, issue a corrected tax bill for any additional taxes with interest at the rate of 1% per month or fraction of a month computed from the date the taxes were last payable without interest.

The rebate shall be without interest. If a claim for exemption under this section is filed by October 31 and is approved, that exemption shall begin on December 31 of the year in which the facility is fully and finally completed and the owner of the property properly submitted a claim for exemption to the assessor of the local tax collecting unit under this subsection and shall continue until the property is no longer used for occupancy or use solely by elderly or disabled families.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The local tax collecting unit shall distribute the amount received under subsection (4) in the same manner and in the same proportions as general ad valorem taxes collected under this act, excluding any distribution that would have been made under section 1211 of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1211, and the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The state treasurer shall estimate the amount necessary to meet the expense of administering the provisions of this section in each year, and the legislature shall appropriate an amount sufficient to meet that expense in each year.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The principal residence of a person who, in the judgment of the supervisor and board of review, by reason of poverty, is unable to contribute toward the public charges is eligible for exemption in whole or in part from the collection of taxes under this act. This section does not apply to the property of a corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) To be eligible for exemption under this section, a person shall, subject to subsections (6), (8), and (10), do all of the following on an annual basis:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Own and occupy as a principal residence the property for which an exemption is requested. The person shall affirm this ownership and occupancy status in writing by filing a form prescribed by the state tax commission with the local assessing unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) File a claim with the board of review on a form prescribed by the state tax commission and provided by the local assessing unit, accompanied by federal and state income tax returns for all persons residing in the principal residence, including any property tax credit returns, filed in the immediately preceding year or in the current year. Federal and state income tax returns are not required for a person residing in the principal residence if that person was not required to file a federal or state income tax return in the tax year in which the exemption under this section is claimed or in the immediately preceding tax year. If a person was not required to file a federal or state income tax return in the tax year in which the exemption under this section is claimed or in the immediately preceding tax year, an affidavit in a form prescribed by the state tax commission may be accepted in place of the federal or state income tax return. The filing of a claim under this subsection constitutes an appearance before the board of review for the purpose of preserving the claimant's right to appeal the decision of the board of review regarding the claim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Produce a valid driver license or other form of identification if requested by the supervisor or board of review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Produce a deed, land contract, or other evidence of ownership of the property for which an exemption is requested if required by the supervisor or board of review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Meet the federal poverty guidelines published in the prior calendar year in the Federal Register by the United States Department of Health and Human Services under its authority to revise the poverty line under 42 USC 9902, or alternative guidelines adopted by the governing body of the local assessing unit provided the alternative guidelines do not provide income eligibility requirements less than the federal guidelines.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The application for an exemption under this section must be filed after January 1 but before the day prior to the last day of the board of review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The governing body of the local assessing unit shall determine and make available to the public the policy and guidelines used for the granting of exemptions under this section. If the local assessing unit maintains a website, the local assessing unit shall make the policy and guidelines, and the form described in subsection (2)(b), available to the public on the website. The guidelines must include, but are not limited to, the specific income and asset levels of the claimant and total household income and assets.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The board of review shall follow the policy and guidelines of the local assessing unit in granting or denying an exemption under this section. If a person claiming an exemption under this section is qualified under the eligibility requirements in subsection (2), the board of review shall grant the exemption in whole or in part, as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A full exemption equal to a 100% reduction in taxable value for the tax year in which the exemption is granted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A partial exemption equal to 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A 75%, 50%, or 25% reduction in taxable value for the tax year in which the exemption is granted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) As approved by the state tax commission, any other percentage reduction in taxable value for the tax year in which the exemption is granted, applied in a form and manner prescribed by the state tax commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, a local assessing unit may permit by resolution a principal residence exempt from the collection of taxes under this section in tax year 2019 or 2020, or both, to remain exempt under this section in tax years 2021, 2022, and 2023 without subsequent reapplication for the exemption, provided there has not been a change in ownership or occupancy status of the person eligible for exemption under subsection (2), and may permit a principal residence exempt for the first time from the collection of taxes under this section in tax year 2021, 2022, or 2023 to remain exempt under this section for up to 3 additional years after its initial year of exempt status without subsequent reapplication for the exemption, provided there has not been a change in ownership or occupancy status of the person eligible for exemption under subsection (2), if the person who establishes initial eligibility under subsection (2) receives a fixed income solely from public assistance that is not subject to significant annual increases beyond the rate of inflation, such as federal Supplemental Security Income or Social Security disability or retirement benefits. Both of the following apply to a person who obtains an extended exemption under this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The person shall file with the local assessing unit, in a form and manner prescribed by the state tax commission, an affidavit rescinding the exemption as extended under this subsection within 45 days after either of the following, if applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The person ceases to own or occupy the principal residence for which the exemption was extended.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The person experiences a change in household assets or income that defeats eligibility for the exemption under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the person fails to file a rescission as required under subdivision (a) and the property is later determined to be ineligible for the exemption under this section, the person is subject to repayment of any additional taxes with interest as described in this subdivision. Upon discovery that the property is no longer eligible for the exemption under this section, the assessor shall remove the exemption of that property and, if the tax roll is in the local tax collecting unit's possession, amend the tax roll to reflect the removal of the exemption, and the local treasurer shall, within 30 days of the date of the discovery, issue a corrected tax bill for any additional taxes with interest at the rate of 1% per month or fraction of a month computed from the date the taxes were last payable without interest. If the tax roll is in the county treasurer's possession, the tax roll must be amended to reflect the removal of the exemption and the county treasurer shall, within 30 days of the date of the removal, prepare and submit a supplemental tax bill for any additional taxes, together with interest at the rate of 1% per month or fraction of a month computed from the date the taxes were last payable without interest. Interest on any tax set forth in a corrected or supplemental tax bill again begins to accrue 60 days after the date the corrected or supplemental tax bill is issued at the rate of 1% per month or fraction of a month. Taxes levied in a corrected or supplemental tax bill must be returned as delinquent on the March 1 in the year immediately succeeding the year in which the corrected or supplemental tax bill is issued.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A person who files a claim under this section is not prohibited from also appealing the assessment on the property for which that claim is made before the board of review in the same year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, if the assessor determines that a principal residence of a person by reason of poverty is still eligible for the exemption under this section and the property was exempt from the collection of taxes under this section in tax year 2022, the property will remain exempt from the collection of taxes under this section through tax year 2023 if, on or before December 1, 2023, the governing body of the local assessing unit in which the principal residence is located adopts a resolution that continues the exemption through tax year 2023 for all principal residences within the local assessing unit that were exempt from the collection of taxes under this section in tax year 2022. The local assessing unit may require the owner of a principal residence exempt from the collection of taxes under this subsection to affirm ownership, poverty, and occupancy status in writing by filing with the local assessing unit the form prescribed by the state tax commission under subsection (2)(a). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A local assessing unit that adopts a resolution under subsection (6) or (8) must develop and implement an audit program that includes, but is not limited to, the audit of all information filed under subsection (2). If property is determined to be ineligible for exemption as a result of an audit, the person who filed for the exemption under subsection (2) is subject to repayment of additional taxes including interest to be paid as provided in subsection (6)(b). The state tax commission shall issue a bulletin providing further guidance to local assessing units on the development and implementation of an audit program under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, if an exemption was not on the assessment roll and was not denied, the July or December board of review shall grant an exemption under this section, in whole or in part as described in subsection (5), for the immediately preceding tax year on the principal residence of a person who establishes eligibility in that tax year under the criteria described in subsection (2). A claim of exemption under this subsection must be filed with the board of review on a form prescribed by the state tax commission and provided by the local assessing unit, accompanied by supporting documentation establishing eligibility for the exemption for the immediately preceding tax year and any additional supporting documentation as may be required by the state tax commission. The local assessing unit shall notify the department of treasury, in a form and manner prescribed by the department of treasury, of each exemption granted under this subsection by the board of review for the immediately preceding tax year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) As used in this section, "principal residence" means principal residence or qualified agricultural property as those terms are defined in section 7dd.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A principal residence is exempt from the tax levied by a local school district for school operating purposes to the extent provided under section 1211 of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1211, if an owner of that principal residence claims an exemption as provided in this section. Notwithstanding the tax day provided in section 2, the status of property as a principal residence shall be determined on the date an affidavit claiming an exemption is filed under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5), an owner of property may claim 1 exemption under this section by filing an affidavit on or before May 1 for taxes levied before January 1, 2012 or, for taxes levied after December 31, 2011, on or before June 1 for the immediately succeeding summer tax levy and all subsequent tax levies or on or before November 1 for the immediately succeeding winter tax levy and all subsequent tax levies with the local tax collecting unit in which the property is located. For the 2020 tax year only, an owner may claim 1 exemption under this section by filing an affidavit on or before June 30, 2020 for the 2020 summer tax levy and all subsequent tax levies with the local tax collecting unit in which the property is located. The affidavit shall state that the property is owned and occupied as a principal residence by that owner of the property on the date that the affidavit is signed and shall state that the owner has not claimed a substantially similar exemption, deduction, or credit on property in another state. The affidavit shall be on a form prescribed by the department of treasury. One copy of the affidavit shall be retained by the owner and 1 copy shall be retained by the local tax collecting unit, together with all information submitted under subsection (28) for a cooperative housing corporation. The local tax collecting unit shall forward to the department of treasury a copy of the affidavit and any information submitted under subsection (28) upon a request from the department of treasury. The affidavit shall require the owner claiming the exemption to indicate if that owner or that owner's spouse has claimed another exemption on property in this state that is not rescinded or a substantially similar exemption, deduction, or credit on property in another state that is not rescinded. If the affidavit requires an owner to include a Social Security number, that owner's number is subject to the disclosure restrictions in 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31. If an owner of property filed an affidavit for an exemption under this section before January 1, 2004, that affidavit shall be considered the affidavit required under this subsection for a principal residence exemption and that exemption shall remain in effect until rescinded as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5), a married couple who are required to file or who do file a joint Michigan income tax return are entitled to not more than 1 exemption under this section. For taxes levied after December 31, 2002, a person is not entitled to an exemption under this section in any calendar year in which any of the following conditions occur:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That person has claimed a substantially similar exemption, deduction, or credit, regardless of amount, on property in another state. Upon request by the department of treasury, the assessor of the local tax collecting unit, the county treasurer or his or her designee, or the county equalization director or his or her designee, a person who claims an exemption under this section shall, within 30 days, file an affidavit on a form prescribed by the department of treasury stating that the person has not claimed a substantially similar exemption, deduction, or credit on property in another state. A claim for a substantially similar exemption, deduction, or credit in another state occurs at the time of the filing or granting of a substantially similar exemption, deduction, or credit in another state. If the assessor of the local tax collecting unit, the department of treasury, or the county denies an existing claim for exemption under this section, an owner of the property subject to that denial cannot rescind a substantially similar exemption, deduction, or credit claimed in another state in order to qualify for the exemption under this section for any of the years denied. If a person claims an exemption under this section and a substantially similar exemption, deduction, or credit in another state, that person is subject to a penalty of $500.00. The penalty shall be distributed in the same manner as interest is distributed under subsection (25).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Subject to subdivision (a), that person or his or her spouse owns property in a state other than this state for which that person or his or her spouse claims an exemption, deduction, or credit substantially similar to the exemption provided under this section, unless that person and his or her spouse file separate income tax returns.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) That person has filed a nonresident Michigan income tax return, except active duty military personnel stationed in this state with his or her principal residence in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) That person has filed an income tax return in a state other than this state as a resident, except active duty military personnel stationed in this state with his or her principal residence in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) That person has previously rescinded an exemption under this section for the same property for which an exemption is now claimed and there has not been a transfer of ownership of that property after the previous exemption was rescinded, if either of the following conditions is satisfied:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) That person has claimed an exemption under this section for any other property for that tax year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) That person has rescinded an exemption under this section on other property, which exemption remains in effect for that tax year, and there has not been a transfer of ownership of that property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Upon receipt of an affidavit filed under subsection (2) or subsection (19), and unless the claim is denied under this section, the assessor shall exempt the property from the collection of the tax levied by a local school district for school operating purposes to the extent provided under section 1211 of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1211, as provided in subsection (1) until December 31 of the year in which the property is transferred or, except as otherwise provided in subsections (5), (32), and (33), is no longer a principal residence as defined in section 7dd, or the owner is no longer entitled to an exemption as provided in subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and subsections (32) and (33), not more than 90 days after exempted property is no longer used as a principal residence by the owner claiming an exemption, that owner shall rescind the claim of exemption by filing with the local tax collecting unit a rescission form prescribed by the department of treasury. The local tax collecting unit shall retain the rescission form and shall forward a copy of it to the department of treasury upon a request from the department of treasury. If an owner is eligible for and claims an exemption for that owner's current principal residence, that owner may retain an exemption for not more than 3 tax years on property previously exempt as his or her principal residence if that property is not occupied, is for sale, is not leased, and is not used for any business or commercial purpose by filing a conditional rescission form prescribed by the department of treasury with the local tax collecting unit within the time period prescribed in subsection (2). Beginning in the 2012 tax year, subject to the payment requirement set forth in this subsection, if a land contract vendor, bank, credit union, or other lending institution owns property as a result of a foreclosure or forfeiture of a recorded instrument under chapter 31, 32, or 57 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.3101 to 600.3285 and MCL 600.5701 to 600.5759, or through deed or conveyance in lieu of a foreclosure or forfeiture on that property and that property had been exempt under this section immediately preceding the foreclosure, that land contract vendor, bank, credit union, or other lending institution may retain an exemption on that property at the same percentage of exemption that the property previously had under this section if that property is not occupied other than by the person who claimed the exemption under this section immediately preceding the foreclosure or forfeiture, is for sale, is not leased to any person other than the person who claimed the exemption under this section immediately preceding the foreclosure, and is not used for any business or commercial purpose. A land contract vendor, bank, credit union, or other lending institution may claim an exemption under this subsection by filing a conditional rescission form prescribed by the department of treasury with the local tax collecting unit within the time period prescribed in subsection (2). Property is eligible for a conditional rescission if that property is available for lease and all other conditions under this subsection are met. One copy of the conditional rescission shall be retained by the owner and 1 copy shall be retained by the local tax collecting unit. The local tax collecting unit shall forward to the department of treasury a copy of an affidavit upon a request by the department of treasury. An owner or a land contract vendor, bank, credit union, or other lending institution that files a conditional rescission form shall annually verify to the assessor of the local tax collecting unit on or before December 31 that the property for which the principal residence exemption is retained is not occupied other than by the person who claimed the exemption under this section immediately preceding the foreclosure or forfeiture, is for sale, is not leased except as otherwise provided in this section, and is not used for any business or commercial purpose. The land contract vendor, bank, credit union, or other lending institution may retain the exemption authorized under this section for not more than 3 tax years. If an owner or a land contract vendor, bank, credit union, or other lending institution does not annually verify by December 31 that the property for which the principal residence exemption is retained is not occupied other than by the person who claimed the exemption under this section immediately preceding the foreclosure or forfeiture, is for sale, is not leased except as otherwise provided in this section, and is not used for any business or commercial purpose, the assessor of the local tax collecting unit shall deny the principal residence exemption on that property. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if property subject to a conditional rescission is leased, the local tax collecting unit shall deny that conditional rescission and that denial is retroactive and is effective on December 31 of the year immediately preceding the year in which the property subject to the conditional rescission is leased. An owner who fails to file a rescission as required by this subsection is subject to a penalty of $5.00 per day for each separate failure beginning after the 90 days have elapsed, up to a maximum of $200.00. This penalty shall be collected under 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and shall be deposited in the state school aid fund established in section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963. This penalty may be waived by the department of treasury. If a land contract vendor, bank, credit union, or other lending institution retains an exemption on property under this subsection, that land contract vendor, bank, credit union, or other lending institution shall pay an amount equal to the additional amount that land contract vendor, bank, credit union, or other lending institution would have paid under section 1211 of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1211, if an exemption had not been retained on that property, together with an administration fee equal to the property tax administration fee imposed under section 44. The payment required under this subsection shall be collected by the local tax collecting unit at the same time and in the same manner as taxes collected under this act. The administration fee shall be retained by the local tax collecting unit. The amount collected that the land contract vendor, bank, credit union, or other lending institution would have paid under section 1211 of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1211, if an exemption had not been retained on that property is an amount that is not captured by any authority as tax increment revenues and shall be distributed to the department of treasury monthly for deposit into the state school aid fund established in section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963. If a land contract vendor, bank, credit union, or other lending institution transfers ownership of property for which an exemption is retained under this subsection, that land contract vendor, bank, credit union, or other lending institution shall rescind the exemption as provided in this section and shall notify the treasurer of the local tax collecting unit of that transfer of ownership. If a land contract vendor, bank, credit union, or other lending institution fails to make the payment required under this subsection for any property within the period for which property taxes are due and payable without penalty, the local tax collecting unit shall deny that conditional rescission and that denial is retroactive and is effective on December 31 of the immediately preceding year. If the local tax collecting unit denies a conditional rescission, the local tax collecting unit shall remove the exemption of the property and the amount due from the land contract vendor, bank, credit union, or other lending institution shall be a tax so that the additional taxes, penalties, and interest shall be collected as provided for in this section. If payment of the tax under this subsection is not made by the March 1 following the levy of the tax, the tax shall be turned over to the county treasurer and collected in the same manner as delinquent taxes under this act. An owner of property who previously occupied that property as his or her principal residence but now resides in a nursing home, assisted living facility, or, if residing there solely for purposes of convalescence, any other location may retain an exemption on that property if the owner manifests an intent to return to that property by satisfying all of the following conditions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The owner continues to own that property while residing in the nursing home, assisted living facility, or other location.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The owner has not established a new principal residence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The owner maintains or provides for the maintenance of that property while residing in the nursing home, assisted living facility, or other location.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) That property is not leased and is not used for any business or commercial purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (5), (32), and (33), if the assessor of the local tax collecting unit believes that the property for which an exemption is claimed is not the principal residence of the owner claiming the exemption, the assessor may deny a new or existing claim by notifying the owner and the county treasurer in writing of the reason for the denial and advising the owner that the denial may be appealed to the residential and small claims division of the Michigan tax tribunal within 35 days after the date of the notice. The assessor may deny a claim for exemption for the current year and for the 3 immediately preceding calendar years. If the assessor denies an existing claim for exemption, the assessor shall remove the exemption of the property and, if the tax roll is in the local tax collecting unit's possession, amend the tax roll to reflect the denial and the local treasurer shall within 30 days of the date of the denial issue a corrected tax bill for any additional taxes with interest at the rate of 1.25% per month or fraction of a month and penalties computed from the date the taxes were last payable without interest or penalty. If the tax roll is in the county treasurer's possession, the tax roll shall be amended to reflect the denial and the county treasurer shall within 30 days of the date of the denial prepare and submit a supplemental tax bill for any additional taxes, together with interest at the rate of 1.25% per month or fraction of a month and penalties computed from the date the taxes were last payable without interest or penalty. Interest on any tax set forth in a corrected or supplemental tax bill shall again begin to accrue 60 days after the date the corrected or supplemental tax bill is issued at the rate of 1.25% per month or fraction of a month. Taxes levied in a corrected or supplemental tax bill shall be returned as delinquent on the March 1 in the year immediately succeeding the year in which the corrected or supplemental tax bill is issued. If the assessor denies an existing claim for exemption, the interest due shall be distributed as provided in subsection (25). However, if the property has been transferred to a bona fide purchaser before additional taxes were billed to the seller as a result of the denial of a claim for exemption, the taxes, interest, and penalties shall not be a lien on the property and shall not be billed to the bona fide purchaser, and the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of the tax roll or the county treasurer if the county has possession of the tax roll shall notify the department of treasury of the amount of tax due, interest, and penalties through the date of that notification. The department of treasury shall then assess the owner who claimed the exemption under this section for the tax, interest, and penalties accruing as a result of the denial of the claim for exemption, if any, as for unpaid taxes provided under 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and shall deposit any tax or penalty collected into the state school aid fund and shall distribute any interest collected as provided in subsection (25). The denial shall be made on a form prescribed by the department of treasury. The assessor shall forward to the department of treasury a copy of a denial upon a request by the department of treasury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the assessor of the local tax collecting unit believes that the property for which the exemption is claimed is not the principal residence of the owner claiming the exemption and has not denied the claim, the assessor shall include a recommendation for denial with any affidavit that is forwarded to the department of treasury or, for an existing claim, shall send a recommendation for denial to the department of treasury, stating the reasons for the recommendation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The department of treasury shall determine if the property is the principal residence of the owner claiming the exemption. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (21), the department of treasury may review the validity of exemptions for the current calendar year and for the 3 immediately preceding calendar years. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (5), (32), and (33), if the department of treasury determines that the property is not the principal residence of the owner claiming the exemption, the department shall send a notice of that determination to the local tax collecting unit and to the owner of the property claiming the exemption, indicating that the claim for exemption is denied, stating the reason for the denial, and advising the owner claiming the exemption of the right to appeal the determination to the department of treasury and what those rights of appeal are. The department of treasury may issue a notice denying a claim if an owner fails to respond within 30 days of receipt of a request for information from that department. An owner may appeal the denial of a claim of exemption to the department of treasury within 35 days of receipt of the notice of denial. An appeal to the department of treasury shall be conducted according to the provisions for an informal conference in section 21 of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.21. Within 10 days after acknowledging an appeal of a denial of a claim of exemption, the department of treasury shall notify the assessor and the treasurer for the county in which the property is located that an appeal has been filed. Upon receipt of a notice that the department of treasury has denied a claim for exemption, the assessor shall remove the exemption of the property and, if the tax roll is in the local tax collecting unit's possession, amend the tax roll to reflect the denial and the local treasurer shall within 30 days of the date of the denial issue a corrected tax bill for any additional taxes with interest at the rate of 1.25% per month or fraction of a month and penalties computed from the date the taxes were last payable without interest and penalty. If the tax roll is in the county treasurer's possession, the tax roll shall be amended to reflect the denial and the county treasurer shall within 30 days of the date of the denial prepare and submit a supplemental tax bill for any additional taxes, together with interest at the rate of 1.25% per month or fraction of a month and penalties computed from the date the taxes were last payable without interest or penalty. Interest on any tax set forth in a corrected or supplemental tax bill shall again begin to accrue 60 days after the date the corrected or supplemental tax bill is issued at the rate of 1.25% per month or fraction of a month. The department of treasury may waive interest on any tax set forth in a corrected or supplemental tax bill for the current tax year and the immediately preceding 3 tax years if the assessor of the local tax collecting unit files with the department of treasury a sworn affidavit in a form prescribed by the department of treasury stating that the tax set forth in the corrected or supplemental tax bill is a result of the assessor's classification error or other error or the assessor's failure to rescind the exemption after the owner requested in writing that the exemption be rescinded. Taxes levied in a corrected or supplemental tax bill shall be returned as delinquent on the March 1 in the year immediately succeeding the year in which the corrected or supplemental tax bill is issued. If the department of treasury denies an existing claim for exemption, the interest due shall be distributed as provided in subsection (25). However, if the property has been transferred to a bona fide purchaser before additional taxes were billed to the seller as a result of the denial of a claim for exemption, the taxes, interest, and penalties shall not be a lien on the property and shall not be billed to the bona fide purchaser, and the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of the tax roll or the county treasurer if the county has possession of the tax roll shall notify the department of treasury of the amount of tax due and interest through the date of that notification. The department of treasury shall then assess the owner who claimed the exemption under this section for the tax and interest plus penalty accruing as a result of the denial of the claim for exemption, if any, as for unpaid taxes provided under 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and shall deposit any tax or penalty collected into the state school aid fund and shall distribute any interest collected as provided in subsection (25).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The department of treasury may enter into an agreement regarding the implementation or administration of subsection (8) with the assessor of any local tax collecting unit in a county that has not elected to audit exemptions claimed under this section as provided in subsection (10). The agreement may specify that for a period of time, not to exceed 120 days, the department of treasury will not deny an exemption identified by the department of treasury in the list provided under subsection (11).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A county may elect to audit the exemptions claimed under this section in all local tax collecting units located in that county as provided in this subsection. The election to audit exemptions shall be made by the county treasurer, or by the county equalization director with the concurrence by resolution of the county board of commissioners. The initial election to audit exemptions shall require an audit period of 2 years. Before 2009, subsequent elections to audit exemptions shall be made every 2 years and shall require 2 annual audit periods. Beginning in 2009, an election to audit exemptions shall be made every 5 years and shall require 5 annual audit periods. An election to audit exemptions shall be made by submitting an election to audit form to the assessor of each local tax collecting unit in that county and to the department of treasury not later than April 1 preceding the October 1 in the year in which an election to audit is made. The election to audit form required under this subsection shall be in a form prescribed by the department of treasury. If a county elects to audit the exemptions claimed under this section, the department of treasury may continue to review the validity of exemptions as provided in subsection (8). If a county does not elect to audit the exemptions claimed under this section as provided in this subsection, the department of treasury shall conduct an audit of exemptions claimed under this section in the initial 2-year audit period for each local tax collecting unit in that county unless the department of treasury has entered into an agreement with the assessor for that local tax collecting unit under subsection (9).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If a county elects to audit the exemptions claimed under this section as provided in subsection (10) and the county treasurer or his or her designee or the county equalization director or his or her designee believes that the property for which an exemption is claimed is not the principal residence of the owner claiming the exemption, the county treasurer or his or her designee or the county equalization director or his or her designee may, except as otherwise provided in subsections (5), (32), and (33), deny an existing claim by notifying the owner and the assessor of the local tax collecting unit in writing of the reason for the denial and advising the owner that the denial may be appealed to the residential and small claims division of the Michigan tax tribunal within 35 days after the date of the notice. The county treasurer or his or her designee or the county equalization director or his or her designee may deny a claim for exemption for the current year and for the 3 immediately preceding calendar years. If the county treasurer or his or her designee or the county equalization director or his or her designee denies an existing claim for exemption, the county treasurer or his or her designee or the county equalization director or his or her designee shall direct the assessor of the local tax collecting unit in which the property is located to remove the exemption of the property from the assessment roll and, if the tax roll is in the local tax collecting unit's possession, direct the assessor of the local tax collecting unit to amend the tax roll to reflect the denial and the treasurer of the local tax collecting unit shall within 30 days of the date of the denial issue a corrected tax bill for any additional taxes with interest at the rate of 1.25% per month or fraction of a month and penalties computed from the date the taxes were last payable without interest and penalty. If the tax roll is in the county treasurer's possession, the tax roll shall be amended to reflect the denial and the county treasurer shall within 30 days of the date of the denial prepare and submit a supplemental tax bill for any additional taxes, together with interest at the rate of 1.25% per month or fraction of a month and penalties computed from the date the taxes were last payable without interest or penalty. Interest on any tax set forth in a corrected or supplemental tax bill shall again begin to accrue 60 days after the date the corrected or supplemental tax bill is issued at the rate of 1.25% per month or fraction of a month. Taxes levied in a corrected or supplemental tax bill shall be returned as delinquent on the March 1 in the year immediately succeeding the year in which the corrected or supplemental tax bill is issued. If the county treasurer or his or her designee or the county equalization director or his or her designee denies an existing claim for exemption, the interest due shall be distributed as provided in subsection (25). However, if the property has been transferred to a bona fide purchaser before additional taxes were billed to the seller as a result of the denial of a claim for exemption, the taxes, interest, and penalties shall not be a lien on the property and shall not be billed to the bona fide purchaser, and the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of the tax roll or the county treasurer if the county has possession of the tax roll shall notify the department of treasury of the amount of tax due and interest through the date of that notification. The department of treasury shall then assess the owner who claimed the exemption under this section for the tax and interest plus penalty accruing as a result of the denial of the claim for exemption, if any, as for unpaid taxes provided under 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and shall deposit any tax or penalty collected into the state school aid fund and shall distribute any interest collected as provided in subsection (25). The denial shall be made on a form prescribed by the department of treasury. The county treasurer or his or her designee or the county equalization director or his or her designee shall forward to the department of treasury a copy of a denial upon a request by the department of treasury. The department of treasury shall annually provide the county treasurer or his or her designee or the county equalization director or his or her designee a list of parcels of property located in that county for which an exemption may be erroneously claimed. The county treasurer or his or her designee or the county equalization director or his or her designee shall forward copies of the list provided by the department of treasury to each assessor in each local tax collecting unit in that county within 10 days of receiving the list.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If a county elects to audit exemptions claimed under this section as provided in subsection (10), the county treasurer or the county equalization director may enter into an agreement with the assessor of a local tax collecting unit in that county regarding the implementation or administration of this section. The agreement may specify that for a period of time, not to exceed 120 days, the county will not deny an exemption identified by the department of treasury in the list provided under subsection (11).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) An owner may appeal a denial by the assessor of the local tax collecting unit under subsection (6), a final decision of the department of treasury under subsection (8), or a denial by the county treasurer or his or her designee or the county equalization director or his or her designee under subsection (11) to the residential and small claims division of the Michigan tax tribunal within 35 days of that decision. An owner is not required to pay the amount of tax in dispute in order to appeal a denial of a claim of exemption to the department of treasury or to receive a final determination of the residential and small claims division of the Michigan tax tribunal. However, interest at the rate of 1.25% per month or fraction of a month and penalties shall accrue and be computed from the date the taxes were last payable without interest and penalty. If the residential and small claims division of the Michigan tax tribunal grants an owner's appeal of a denial and that owner has paid the interest due as a result of a denial under subsection (6), (8), or (11), the interest received after a distribution was made under subsection (25) shall be refunded.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) For taxes levied after December 31, 2005, for each county in which the county treasurer or the county equalization director does not elect to audit the exemptions claimed under this section as provided in subsection (10), the department of treasury shall conduct an annual audit of exemptions claimed under this section for the current calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) When an exemption is rescinded as provided in subsection (5), the assessor of the local tax collecting unit shall remove the exemption effective December 31 of the year in which the affidavit was filed that rescinded the exemption. For any year for which the rescinded exemption has not been removed from the tax roll, the exemption shall be denied as provided in this section. However, interest and penalty shall not be imposed for a year for which a rescission form has been timely filed under subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (30), if the principal residence is part of a unit in a multiple-unit dwelling or a dwelling unit in a multiple-purpose structure, an owner shall claim an exemption for only that portion of the total taxable value of the property used as the principal residence of that owner in a manner prescribed by the department of treasury. If a portion of a parcel for which the owner claims an exemption is used for a purpose other than as a principal residence, the owner shall claim an exemption for only that portion of the taxable value of the property used as the principal residence of that owner in a manner prescribed by the department of treasury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) When a county register of deeds records a transfer of ownership of a property, he or she shall notify the local tax collecting unit in which the property is located of the transfer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) The department of treasury shall make available the affidavit forms and the forms to rescind an exemption, which may be on the same form, to all city and township assessors, county equalization officers, county registers of deeds, and closing agents. A person who prepares a closing statement for the sale of property shall provide affidavit and rescission forms to the buyer and seller at the closing and, if requested by the buyer or seller after execution by the buyer or seller, shall file the forms with the local tax collecting unit in which the property is located. If a closing statement preparer fails to provide exemption affidavit and rescission forms to the buyer and seller, or fails to file the affidavit and rescission forms with the local tax collecting unit if requested by the buyer or seller, the buyer may appeal to the department of treasury within 30 days of notice to the buyer that an exemption was not recorded. If the department of treasury determines that the buyer qualifies for the exemption, the department of treasury shall notify the assessor of the local tax collecting unit that the exemption is granted and the assessor of the local tax collecting unit or, if the tax roll is in the possession of the county treasurer, the county treasurer shall correct the tax roll to reflect the exemption. This subsection does not create a cause of action at law or in equity against a closing statement preparer who fails to provide exemption affidavit and rescission forms to a buyer and seller or who fails to file the affidavit and rescission forms with the local tax collecting unit when requested to do so by the buyer or seller.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) An owner who owned and occupied a principal residence within the time period prescribed in subsection (2) for which the exemption was not on the tax roll, or an owner of property who previously occupied that property as his or her principal residence but did not occupy that property within the time period prescribed in subsection (2) while residing in a nursing home, assisted living facility, or other location under the circumstances described in subsection (5)(a) to (d), while absent on active duty as a member of any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States, including the Coast Guard, a reserve component of any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States, or the National Guard, under the circumstances described in subsection (32)(a) to (d), or while absent due to the damage or destruction of the principal residence under the circumstances described in subsection (33)(a) to (d), for which the exemption was not on the tax roll, may file an affidavit with the local tax collecting unit claiming an exemption under this section for the current calendar year or the immediately preceding 3 calendar years. The affidavit for the exemption for the current calendar year or the immediately preceding 3 calendar years shall be on the form prescribed by the department of treasury in subsection (2). The affidavit shall be processed by the assessor in accordance with subsection (4). Upon request by the local tax collecting unit, the owner shall furnish proof within 30 days that the owner meets the requirements for the exemption for the current calendar year or the immediately preceding 3 calendar years. For the 2020 tax year only, an affidavit filed on or before June 30, 2020 shall be processed by the assessor in accordance with subsection (4), and if granting the exemption results in an overpayment, a rebate shall be made to the taxpayer in the manner prescribed in subsection (23).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) An owner who owned and occupied a principal residence within the time period prescribed in subsection (2) in any year before the 3 immediately preceding tax years for which the exemption was not on the tax roll as a result of a qualified error on the part of the local tax collecting unit may file a request for the exemption for those tax years with the department of treasury. The request for the exemption shall be in a form prescribed by the department of treasury and shall include all documentation the department of treasury considers necessary to consider the request and to correct any affected official records if a qualified error on the part of the local tax collecting unit is recognized and an exemption is granted. If the department of treasury denies a request for the exemption under this subsection, the owner is responsible for all costs related to the request as determined by the department of treasury. If the department of treasury grants a request for the exemption under this subsection and the exemption results in an overpayment of the tax in the years under consideration, the department of treasury shall notify the treasurer of the local tax collecting unit, the county treasurer, and other affected officials of the error and the granting of the request for the exemption and all affected official records shall be corrected consistent with guidance provided by the department of treasury. If granting the request for the exemption results in an overpayment, a rebate, including any interest paid by the owner, shall be paid to the owner within 30 days of the receipt of the notice. A rebate shall be without interest. The treasurer in possession of the appropriate tax roll may deduct the rebate from the appropriate tax collecting unit's subsequent distribution of taxes. The treasurer in possession of the appropriate tax roll shall bill to the appropriate tax collecting unit the tax collecting unit's share of taxes rebated. A local tax collecting unit responsible for a qualified error under this subsection shall reimburse each county treasurer and other affected local official required to correct official records under this subsection for the costs incurred in complying with this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) If an owner of property received a principal residence exemption to which that owner was not entitled in any year before the 3 immediately preceding tax years, as a result of a qualified error on the part of the local tax collecting unit, the department of treasury may deny the principal residence exemption as provided in subsection (8). If the department of treasury denies an exemption under this subsection, the owner shall be issued a corrected or supplemental tax bill as provided in subsection (8), except interest shall not accrue until 60 days after the date the corrected or supplemental tax bill is issued. A local tax collecting unit responsible for a qualified error under this subsection shall reimburse each county treasurer and other affected local official required to correct official records under this subsection for the costs incurred in complying with this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) If the assessor or treasurer of the local tax collecting unit believes that the department of treasury erroneously denied a claim for exemption, the assessor or treasurer may submit written information supporting the owner's claim for exemption to the department of treasury within 35 days of the owner's receipt of the notice denying the claim for exemption. If, after reviewing the information provided, the department of treasury determines that the claim for exemption was erroneously denied, the department of treasury shall grant the exemption and the tax roll shall be amended to reflect the exemption.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(23) If granting the exemption under this section results in an overpayment of the tax, a rebate, including any interest paid, shall be made to the taxpayer by the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of the tax roll or by the county treasurer if the county has possession of the tax roll within 30 days of the date the exemption is granted. The rebate shall be without interest. If an exemption for property classified as timber-cutover real property is granted under this section for the 2008 or 2009 tax year, the tax roll shall be corrected and any delinquent and unpaid penalty, interest, and tax resulting from that property not having been exempt under this section for the 2008 or 2009 tax year shall be waived.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(24) If an exemption under this section is erroneously granted for an affidavit filed before October 1, 2003, an owner may request in writing that the department of treasury withdraw the exemption. The request to withdraw the exemption shall be received not later than November 1, 2003. If an owner requests that an exemption be withdrawn, the department of treasury shall issue an order notifying the local assessor that the exemption issued under this section has been denied based on the owner's request. If an exemption is withdrawn, the property that had been subject to that exemption shall be immediately placed on the tax roll by the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of the tax roll or by the county treasurer if the county has possession of the tax roll as though the exemption had not been granted. A corrected tax bill shall be issued for the tax year being adjusted by the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of the tax roll or by the county treasurer if the county has possession of the tax roll. Unless a denial has been issued before July 1, 2003, if an owner requests that an exemption under this section be withdrawn and that owner pays the corrected tax bill issued under this subsection within 30 days after the corrected tax bill is issued, that owner is not liable for any penalty or interest on the additional tax. An owner who pays a corrected tax bill issued under this subsection more than 30 days after the corrected tax bill is issued is liable for the penalties and interest that would have accrued if the exemption had not been granted from the date the taxes were originally levied.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(25) Subject to subsection (26), interest at the rate of 1.25% per month or fraction of a month collected under subsection (6), (8), or (11) shall be distributed as follows:</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>211.7ee Qualified agricultural property exemption from tax levied by local school district for school operating purposes; procedures.</B><P>
</P>
<P>Sec. 7ee.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Qualified agricultural property is exempt from the tax levied by a local school district for school operating purposes to the extent provided under section 1211 of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1211, according to the provisions of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Qualified agricultural property that is classified as agricultural under section 34c is exempt under subsection (1) and the owner is not required to file an affidavit claiming an exemption with the local tax collecting unit unless requested by the assessor to determine whether the property includes structures that are not exempt under this section. To claim an exemption under subsection (1) for qualified agricultural property that is not classified as agricultural under section 34c, the owner shall file an affidavit claiming the exemption with the local tax collecting unit by May 1. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The affidavit shall be on a form prescribed by the department of treasury.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   For property classified as agricultural, and upon receipt of an affidavit filed under subsection (2) for property not classified as agricultural, the assessor shall determine if the property is qualified agricultural property and if so shall exempt the property from the collection of the tax as provided in subsection (1) until December 31 of the year in which the property is no longer qualified agricultural property as defined in section 7dd. An owner is required to file a new claim for exemption on the same property as requested by the assessor under subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Not more than 90 days after all or a portion of the exempted property is no longer qualified agricultural property, the owner shall rescind the exemption for the applicable portion of the property by filing with the local tax collecting unit a rescission form prescribed by the department of treasury. An owner who fails to file a rescission as required by this subsection is subject to a penalty of $5.00 per day for each separate failure beginning after the 90 days have elapsed, up to a maximum of $200.00. This penalty shall be collected under 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and shall be deposited in the state school aid fund established in section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963. This penalty may be waived by the department of treasury.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   An owner of property that is qualified agricultural property on May 1 for which an exemption was not on the tax roll may file an appeal with the July or December board of review in the year the exemption was claimed or the immediately succeeding year. An owner of property that is qualified agricultural property on May 1 for which an exemption was denied by the assessor in the year the affidavit was filed, may file an appeal with the July board of review for summer taxes or, if there is not a summer levy of school operating taxes, with the December board of review.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If the assessor of the local tax collecting unit believes that the property for which an exemption has been granted is not qualified agricultural property, the assessor may deny or modify an existing exemption by notifying the owner in writing at the time required for providing a notice under section 24c. A taxpayer may appeal the assessor's determination to the board of review meeting under section 30. A decision of the board of review may be appealed to the residential and small claims division of the Michigan tax tribunal.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If an exemption under this section is erroneously granted, an owner may request in writing that the local tax collecting unit withdraw the exemption. If an owner requests that an exemption be withdrawn, the local assessor shall notify the owner that the exemption issued under this section has been denied based on that owner's request. If an exemption is withdrawn, the property that had been subject to that exemption shall be immediately placed on the tax roll by the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of the tax roll or by the county treasurer if the county has possession of the tax roll as though the exemption had not been granted. A corrected tax bill shall be issued for the tax year being adjusted by the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of the tax roll or by the county treasurer if the county has possession of the tax roll. If an owner requests that an exemption under this section be withdrawn before that owner is contacted in writing by the local assessor regarding that owner's eligibility for the exemption and that owner pays the corrected tax bill issued under this subsection within 30 days after the corrected tax bill is issued, that owner is not liable for any penalty or interest on the additional tax. An owner who pays a corrected tax bill issued under this subsection more than 30 days after the corrected tax bill is issued is liable for the penalties and interest that would have accrued if the exemption had not been granted from the date the taxes were originally levied.</DIV>

Buildings, structures, or land improvements located on qualified forest property are not eligible for the exemption under this section. The amount of qualified forest property in this state that is eligible for the exemption under this section is limited as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) In the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, 300,000 acres.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a property owner is interested in obtaining an exemption for qualified forest property under this section, the property owner may contact the local conservation district or the department, and the local conservation district or the department shall advise the property owner on the exemption process. If requested by the property owner, the local conservation district or the department shall provide the property owner with a list of qualified foresters to prepare a forest management plan.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A conservation district shall review the application to determine if the applied-for property meets the minimum requirements set forth in subsection (17)(k) for enrolling into the qualified forest program. A conservation district shall respond within 45 days after the date of its receipt of the application indicating whether the property in the application is eligible for enrollment. If the conservation district does not respond within 45 days after its receipt of the application, the property shall be considered eligible for the exemption under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The department shall review the application, comments from the conservation district, and the forest management plan to determine if the property is eligible for the exemption under this section.

If the application and supporting documents are in compliance with the requirements of this section, the department shall approve the application and shall prepare a qualified forest school tax affidavit, in recordable form, indicating all of the information described in subdivisions (a) to (f). If the application and supporting documents that are in compliance with this section and approved by the department extend to multiple parcels owned by the same person and located in the same local tax collecting unit, the department may include the following information, required for each parcel in recordable form, in a single qualified forest school tax affidavit:</div>

The property owner shall provide a copy of the qualified forest school tax affidavit to the department. The department shall provide a spreadsheet listing all parcels for which it has received a qualified forest school tax affidavit to the conservation district and to the department of treasury. These spreadsheets may be sent electronically.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the application is denied, the property owner has 30 days from the date of notification of the denial by the department to initiate an appeal of that denial. An appeal of the denial shall be by certified letter to the director of the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) To claim an exemption under subsection (1), the owner of qualified forest property shall provide a copy of the recorded qualified forest school tax affidavit attesting that the land is qualified forest property to the local tax collecting unit and assessor by December 31. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a copy of the recorded qualified forest school tax affidavit is provided to the assessor by the owner, the assessor shall exempt the property from the collection of the tax as provided in subsection (1) until December 31 of the year in which the property is no longer qualified forest property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Beginning in the year that qualified forest property is first exempt under this section and each year thereafter, the local tax collecting unit shall collect a fee on each parcel of qualified forest property exempt under this section located in that local tax collecting unit.

Each local tax collecting unit shall disburse the fee collected under this subsection to the department of treasury for deposit in the private forestland enhancement fund created in section 51305 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.51305. If property is no longer exempt as qualified forest property under this section, the fee under this subsection shall not be collected on that property. The fee collected in this subsection shall be subject to the property tax administration fee established by the local tax collecting unit under section 44.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Not more than 90 days after all or a portion of the exempted property is no longer qualified forest property, the owner shall notify the department that all or a portion of the property is no longer qualified forest property.

The county treasurer shall bill the landowner for any recapture tax required under the qualified forest property recapture tax act, 2006 PA 379, MCL 211.1031 to 211.1036. When, as provided in section 5 of the qualified forest property recapture tax act, 2006 PA 379, MCL 211.1035, the proceeds of the recapture tax are deposited into the private forestland enhancement fund created in section 51305 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.51305, the department shall prepare a rescission form for the applicable portion of the property that is no longer qualified forest property and shall file the rescission form with the register of deeds for the county in which the exempted property is located. A copy of the rescission form shall be provided to the assessor by the department. The rescission form shall include a legal description of the exempted property. If an owner fails to notify the department that all or a portion of the property is no longer qualified forest property as required by this subsection, that owner is subject to a penalty of $5.00 per day for each separate failure beginning the day immediately after the 90 days have elapsed, up to a maximum of $1,000.00. This penalty shall be collected under 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and shall be deposited in the private forestland enhancement fund created in section 51305 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.51305.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If property for which an exemption has been granted under this section is not qualified forest property, the department shall notify the local tax collecting unit and the property that had been subject to that exemption shall be immediately placed on the tax roll by the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of the tax roll or by the county treasurer if the county has possession of the tax roll as though the exemption had not been granted. A corrected tax bill shall be issued for each tax year being adjusted by the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of the tax roll or by the county treasurer if the county has possession of the tax roll.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) If all or a portion of property for which an exemption has been granted under this section is converted by a change in use and is no longer qualified forest property, or if an owner of qualified forest property does not wish to keep all or a portion of the property enrolled in the qualified forest program, the owner of the property converted by a change in use or to be withdrawn from the qualified forest program shall notify the department as provided for in subsection (10) on a form created by the department. The form shall include a legal description of the exempted property. A copy of the form shall be filed with the register of deeds for the county in which the exempted property is located. Upon notice that property is no longer qualified forest property, the local tax collecting unit and assessor shall immediately rescind the exemption under this section and shall place the property on the tax roll as though the exemption under this section had not been granted for the immediately succeeding tax year and the department of treasury shall immediately begin collection of any applicable tax and penalty under this act or under the qualified forest property recapture tax act, 2006 PA 379, MCL 211.1031 to 211.1036. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) If qualified forest property is exempt under this section, an owner of that qualified forest property shall report to the department on a form prescribed by the department when a forest practice or timber harvest has occurred on the qualified forest property during a calendar year. The report shall indicate the forest practice completed and the volume and value of timber harvested on that qualified forest property.

If an owner does not accomplish forest practices and harvests within 3 years after the time specified in the current forest management plan and the plan has not been amended to extend the date of forest practices and harvests, the property is not eligible for the exemption under this section, the department shall notify the local tax collecting unit that the property is not eligible for the exemption under this section, and the property shall be placed on the tax roll as though the exemption under this section had not been granted as provided in this section and shall be subject to repayment as indicated in the qualified forest property recapture tax act, 2006 PA 379, MCL 211.1031 to 211.1036.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An owner of supportive housing property may claim an exemption under this section by filing an affidavit on or before December 31 with the local tax collecting unit in which the supportive housing property is located. The affidavit shall state that the property is owned and occupied as supportive housing property on the date that the affidavit is signed. The affidavit shall be on a form prescribed by the department of treasury. One copy of the affidavit shall be retained by the owner, 1 copy shall be retained by the local tax collecting unit until any appeal or audit period under this act has expired, and 1 copy shall be forwarded to the department of treasury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Upon receipt of an affidavit filed under subsection (2) and unless the claim is denied under this section, the assessor shall exempt the supportive housing property from the collection of the tax levied by a local school district for school operating purposes to the extent provided under section 1211 of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1211, as provided in subsection (1) until December 31 of the year in which the property is no longer supportive housing property. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Not more than 90 days after exempted property is no longer supportive housing property, an owner shall rescind the claim of exemption by filing with the local tax collecting unit a rescission form prescribed by the department of treasury. An owner who fails to file a rescission as required by this subsection is subject to a penalty of $5.00 per day for each separate failure beginning after the 90 days have elapsed, up to a maximum of $200.00. This penalty shall be collected under 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and shall be deposited in the state school aid fund established in section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963.

The assessor may deny a claim for exemption for the current year and for the 3 immediately preceding calendar years. If the assessor denies an existing claim for exemption, the assessor shall remove the exemption of the property and, if the tax roll is in the local tax collecting unit's possession, amend the tax roll to reflect the denial and the local treasurer shall within 30 days of the date of the denial issue a corrected tax bill for any additional taxes with interest and penalties computed from the date the taxes were last payable without interest or penalty. If the tax roll is in the county treasurer's possession, the tax roll shall be amended to reflect the denial and the county treasurer shall within 30 days of the date of the denial prepare and submit a supplemental tax bill for any additional taxes, together with interest and penalties computed from the date the taxes were last payable without interest or penalty. Taxes levied in a corrected or supplemental tax bill shall be returned as delinquent on the March 1 in the year immediately succeeding the year in which the corrected or supplemental tax bill is issued. However, if the property has been transferred to a bona fide purchaser before additional taxes were billed to the seller as a result of the denial of a claim for exemption, the taxes, interest, and penalties shall not be a lien on the property and shall not be billed to the bona fide purchaser, and the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of the tax roll or the county treasurer if the county has possession of the tax roll shall notify the department of treasury of the amount of tax due, interest, and penalties through the date of that notification. The department of treasury shall then assess the owner who claimed the exemption under this section for the tax, interest, and penalties accruing as a result of the denial of the claim for exemption, if any, as for unpaid taxes provided under 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and shall deposit any tax, penalty, and interest collected into the state school aid fund.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Beginning December 31, 2015 and each year thereafter, qualified new personal property for which an exemption has been properly claimed under subsection (2) is exempt from the collection of taxes under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A person shall claim the exemption under this section and section 9n by filing a combined document that includes: the form to claim the exemption under this section and section 9n, a report of the fair market value and year of acquisition by the first owner of qualified new personal property, and for any year before 2023, a statement under section 19. All of the following apply to a claim of the exemption under this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The combined document must be in a form and manner prescribed by the department of treasury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Leasing companies are not eligible to receive the exemption under this section and may not use the combined document prescribed in this section. With respect to personal property that is the subject of a lease agreement, regardless of whether the agreement constitutes a lease for financial or tax purposes, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the personal property is eligible manufacturing personal property, the lessee and lessor may elect that the lessee report the leased personal property on the combined document.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) An election made by the lessee and the lessor under this subdivision must be made in a form and manner approved by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Absent an election, the personal property must be reported by the lessor on the personal property statement unless the exemption for eligible manufacturing personal property is claimed by the lessee on the combined document.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The combined document prescribed in this section must be completed and delivered to the assessor of the township or city in which the qualified new personal property is located by February 20 of each year for any year the exemption is claimed before 2023 and the first year the exemption is claimed in a year after 2022. However, if February 20 of a year is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the delivery deadline for that year is the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. For purposes of a combined document delivered by the United States Postal Service, the delivery is timely if the postmark date is on or before the delivery deadline prescribed in this subdivision. If the combined document prescribed in this section is not timely delivered to the assessor of the township or city, a late application may be filed directly with the March board of review before its final adjournment by submitting the combined document prescribed in this section. The board of review shall not accept a filing after adjournment of its March meeting. An appeal of a denial by the March board of review may be made by filing a petition with the Michigan tax tribunal within 35 days of the denial notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The assessor shall transmit to the department of treasury the information contained in the combined document filed under this section, and other parcel information required by the department of treasury, in the form and manner prescribed by the department of treasury by no later than April 1.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Beginning in 2023, an exemption granted under this section remains in effect until the personal property is no longer qualified new personal property. A person claiming an exemption under this section shall rescind the claim of exemption by February 20, or if February 20 of a year is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, of the year in which exempted property is no longer eligible for the exemption by filing with the assessor of the township or city a rescission form prescribed by the department of treasury and the statement required under section 19. Upon receipt of a timely filed rescission form, the local assessor shall immediately remove the exemption. An owner that fails to file a rescission for property later determined to be ineligible for the exemption will be subject to repayment of any additional taxes with interest as described in this subdivision. Upon discovery that the property is no longer eligible manufacturing personal property, the assessor shall remove the exemption of that personal property and, if the tax roll is in the local tax collecting unit's possession, amend the tax roll to reflect the removal of the exemption, and the local treasurer shall within 30 days of the date of the discovery issue a corrected tax bill for any additional taxes with interest at the rate of 1% per month or fraction of a month and penalties computed from the date the taxes were last payable without interest or penalty. If the tax roll is in the county treasurer's possession, the tax roll must be amended to reflect the removal of the exemption and the county treasurer shall within 30 days of the date of the removal prepare and submit a supplemental tax bill for any additional taxes, together with interest at the rate of 1% per month or fraction of a month and penalties computed from the date the taxes were last payable without interest or penalty. Interest on any tax set forth in a corrected or supplemental tax bill again begins to accrue 60 days after the date the corrected or supplemental tax bill is issued at the rate of 1% per month or fraction of a month. Taxes levied in a corrected or supplemental tax bill must be returned as delinquent on the March 1 in the year immediately succeeding the year in which the corrected or supplemental tax bill is issued.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The assessor of the township or city shall annually transmit the rescission forms filed, or the information contained in the rescission forms filed, under this section to the department of treasury in the form and in the manner prescribed by the department of treasury no later than April 1.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the assessor of the township or city believes that personal property for which the form claiming an exemption is timely filed each year under subsection (2)(c) is not qualified new personal property or the form filed was incomplete, the assessor may deny that claim for exemption by notifying the person that filed the form in writing of the reason for the denial and advising the person that the denial must be appealed to the board of review under section 30 by filing a combined document as prescribed under subsection (2). If the denial is issued after the first meeting of the March board of review that follows the organizational meeting, the appeal of the denial is either to the March board of review or the Michigan tax tribunal by filing a petition and a completed combined document as prescribed under subsection (2), within 35 days of the denial notice. The assessor may deny a claim for exemption under this subsection for the current year only. If the assessor denies a claim for exemption, the assessor shall remove the exemption of that personal property and amend the tax roll to reflect the denial and the local treasurer shall within 30 days of the date of the denial issue a corrected tax bill for any additional taxes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A person claiming an exemption for qualified new personal property exempt under this section shall maintain books and records and shall provide access to those books and records as provided in section 22.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Affiliated person" means a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, association, flow-through entity, member of a unitary business group, or other entity related to a person claiming an exemption under this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Eligible manufacturing personal property" means all personal property located on occupied real property if that personal property is predominantly used in industrial processing or direct integrated support. For personal property that is construction in progress and part of a new facility not in operation, eligible manufacturing personal property means all personal property that is part of that new facility if that personal property will be predominantly used in industrial processing when the facility becomes operational. Personal property that is not owned, leased, or used by the person who owns or leases occupied real property where the personal property is located is not eligible manufacturing personal property, unless the personal property is located on the occupied real property to carry on a current on-site business activity. Personal property that is placed on occupied real property solely to qualify the personal property for an exemption under this section or section 9n is not eligible manufacturing personal property. Utility personal property as described in section 34c(3)(e) and personal property used in the generation, transmission, or distribution of electricity for sale are not eligible manufacturing personal property. Personal property located on occupied real property is predominantly used in industrial processing or direct integrated support if the result of the following calculation is more than 50%:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Multiply the original cost of all personal property that is subject to the collection of taxes under this act and all personal property that is exempt from the collection of taxes under sections 7k, 9b, 9f, 9n, and 9o and this section that is located on that occupied real property and that is not construction in progress by its percentage of use in industrial processing or in direct integrated support. For an item of personal property that is used in industrial processing, its percentage of use in industrial processing must equal the percentage of the exemption the property would be eligible for under section 4t of the general sales tax act, 1933 PA 167, MCL 205.54t, or section 4o of the use tax act, 1937 PA 94, MCL 205.94o. Utility personal property as described in section 34c(3)(e) and personal property used in the generation, transmission, or distribution of electricity for sale is not included in this calculation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Divide the result of the calculation under subparagraph (i) by the total original cost of all personal property that is subject to the collection of taxes under this act and all personal property that is exempt from the collection of taxes under sections 7k, 9b, 9f, 9n, and 9o and this section that is located on that occupied real property and that is not construction in progress. Utility personal property as described in section 34c(3)(e) and personal property used in the generation, transmission, or distribution of electricity for sale is not included in this calculation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Fair market value" means the fair market value of personal property at the time of acquisition by the first owner, including the cost of freight, sales tax, installation, and other capitalized costs, except capitalized interest. There is a rebuttable presumption that the acquisition price paid by the first owner for personal property, and any costs of freight, sales tax, installation, and other capitalized costs, except capitalized interest, reflect the fair market value.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) "Industrial processing" means that term as defined in section 4t of the general sales tax act, 1933 PA 167, MCL 205.54t, or section 4o of the use tax act, 1937 PA 94, MCL 205.94o. Industrial processing does not include the generation, transmission, or distribution of electricity for sale.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) "New personal property" means property that was initially placed in service in this state or outside of this state after December 31, 2012 or that was construction in progress on or after December 31, 2012 that had not been placed in service in this state or outside of this state before 2013.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) "Occupied real property" means any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A parcel of real property that is entirely owned, leased, or otherwise occupied by a person claiming an exemption under this section or under section 9n.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Contiguous parcels of real property that are entirely owned, leased, or otherwise occupied by a person claiming an exemption under this section or under section 9n and that host a single, integrated business operation engaged primarily in industrial processing, direct integrated support, or both. A business operation is not engaged primarily in industrial processing, direct integrated support, or both if it engages in significant business activities that are not directly related to industrial processing or direct integrated support. Contiguity is not broken by a boundary between local tax collecting units, a road, a right-of-way, or property purchased or taken under condemnation proceedings by a public utility for power transmission lines if the 2 parcels separated by the purchased or condemned property were a single parcel prior to the sale or condemnation. As used in this subparagraph, "single, integrated business operation" means a company that combines 1 or more related operations or divisions and operates as a single business unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The portion of a parcel of real property that is owned, leased, or otherwise occupied by a person claiming the exemption under this section or under section 9n or by an affiliated person. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) "Original cost" means the fair market value of personal property at the time of acquisition by the first owner. There is a rebuttable presumption that the acquisition price paid by the first owner for personal property reflects the original cost of that personal property. The department of treasury may provide guidelines for 1 or more of the following circumstances: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Determining original cost of personal property when the actual acquisition price paid by the first owner for personal property is not determinative of the original cost of that personal property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Estimating original cost of personal property when the actual acquisition price paid by the first owner for the personal property is unknown.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Adjusting original cost of personal property when the personal property is idle, is obsolete or has material obsolescence, or is surplus.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) "Person" means an individual, partnership, corporation, association, limited liability company, or any other legal entity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) "Qualified new personal property" means property that meets all of the following conditions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Is eligible manufacturing personal property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Is new personal property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the assessor of the local tax collecting unit believes that personal property for which a statement claiming an exemption is timely and properly filed under subsection (2) is not eligible personal property, the assessor may deny that claim for exemption by notifying the person that filed the statement in writing of the reason for the denial and advising the person that the denial may be appealed to the board of review under section 30 during that tax year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The assessor may deny a claim for exemption granted under this section pursuant to a claim of exemption filed under subsection (2)(a) or (b) for the current year and for the 3 immediately preceding calendar years.

The state tax commission may grant a conditional extension of 12 months to an individual who is serving as the director of a county tax or equalization department on March 29, 1985 if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 10f.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    If a local assessing district does not have an assessment roll that has been certified by a qualified certified assessing officer, or if a certified assessor or a board of review for a local tax collecting unit is not in substantial compliance with the provisions of this act, the state tax commission shall assume jurisdiction over the assessment roll and provide for the preparation of a certified roll. The commission may order the county tax or equalization department to prepare the roll; may provide for the use of state employees to prepare the roll; or may order the local assessing unit to contract with a commercial appraisal firm to conduct an appraisal of the property in the assessing unit under the supervision of the county tax or equalization department and the commission. The costs of an appraisal and the preparation of the roll by the county tax or equalization department or by the commission shall be paid by the local assessing district as provided by section 10d. The commission shall consider the quality of the tax maps and appraisal records required by section 10e as part of its investigation of the facts before ordering the local assessing unit to contract for an appraisal.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a certified assessment roll cannot be provided in sufficient time for a summer tax levy, or for the annual levy on December 1, the commission shall order the levy of interim taxes based on the tentative taxable value of individual properties as determined by the commission. Tentative taxable values shall be calculated pursuant to section 27a. State equalized values necessary to determine tentative taxable values shall be determined by the commission, sitting as the state board of equalization, apportioned to the local assessing unit by the county board of commissioners, and apportioned to each property in proportion to the assessed valuation entered in the current uncertified assessment roll. If there is no current assessment roll, the commission shall substitute the latest complete assessment roll for the current roll for the interim tax levy. The payment of a tax levied as an interim tax levy does not constitute a final and ultimate discharge of the taxpayer's liability for the tax levied against that property. An interim tax levy made under this subsection shall be clearly labeled as an "interim tax levy subject to adjustment after an assessment roll is certified".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Within 30 days after the final determination by the commission of the assessed valuation and taxable value for each individual property listed on the assessment roll, the commission shall cause to be mailed a notice of the new assessment and new taxable value to each owner. An owner has the right to petition the tax tribunal directly for a hearing on the assessed valuation or taxable value within 30 days after the date of the notice in the same manner as provided under section 35 of the tax tribunal act, Act No. 186 of the Public Acts of 1973, being section 205.735 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. The notice shall specify each parcel of property, the assessed valuation for the current year, the assessed valuation for the immediately preceding year, the tentative taxable value for the current year, the taxable value for the immediately preceding year, the state equalized valuation for the immediately preceding year, the tentative state equalized valuation for the current year, the net change in the assessed valuation, the net change in the tentative taxable value, and the net change between the tentative state equalized valuation for the current year and the state equalized valuation for the immediately preceding year. The notice shall include a statement informing the owner that an appeal of the assessment or taxable value must be made within 30 days of the date of the assessment notice directly to the tax tribunal and shall also include information on how and where an appeal can be made.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   After the final determination of the state equalized valuations and taxable values by the commission, the assessing officer or, if there is no assessing officer, an agent designated by the commission shall determine the difference in tax, if any, between the interim levy and a levy made on the final taxable values as finally determined by the commission, which may be referred to as the "final levy". The final levy shall be at the rates that were approved and ordered spread for the year in which there was not a certified assessment roll.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A difference in the tax determined in subsection (4) shall be reported to the county board of commissioners, which shall order that additional taxes or credits against individual properties be added to or subtracted from the next succeeding annual tax roll, together with a proportionate share of the property tax administration fee, if a fee is charged, applicable to the difference.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Additional taxes collected or credits against the tax liability made under this section shall be shared by taxing units in the respective proportions that they share the revenue received from the final levy.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The commission shall render technical assistance if necessary to implement this section. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The commission shall provide the tax tribunal with a certified copy of its orders and a copy of each final determination made under this section.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) An adequate process for determining whether to grant or deny exemptions according to statutory requirements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vii) An adequate process for meeting the requirements outlined in the state tax commission's publication entitled, "Supervising Preparation of the Assessment Roll", as those requirements existed on October 1, 2018.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Comply with any other requirement that the state tax commission lawfully promulgates under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, in the exercise of its authority under this act that expressly states that it is intended as an additional requirement under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The state tax commission shall develop and implement an audit program to determine whether an assessing district is in substantial compliance with the requirements in subsection (1). If, after December 31, 2021, the state tax commission determines that an assessing district is not in substantial compliance with the requirements in subsection (1), the state tax commission may initiate the process described in subsection (3) to ensure that the assessing district achieves and maintains substantial compliance with those requirements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The state tax commission shall develop and implement a process to ensure that all assessing districts in the state achieve and maintain substantial compliance with the requirements in subsection (1). At a minimum, that process shall include all of the following actions and procedures:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the state tax commission determines that an assessing district is not in substantial compliance with the requirements in subsection (1) and elects to initiate the process described in this subsection, the commission shall provide the assessing district with a notice of noncompliance setting forth the reasons the assessing district is not in substantial compliance with the requirements in subsection (1) and requesting that the assessing district develop a corrective action plan approved by its governing body to address those deficiencies. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (g), an assessing district shall file a corrective action plan requested under this subdivision with the state tax commission within 60 days after receipt of the notice of noncompliance. The state tax commission shall approve a corrective action plan filed under this subdivision or request changes to the plan within 60 days after filing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) No earlier than May 1 and no later than September 1 of the calendar year immediately following the year of the notice described in subdivision (a), or, in the case of a corrective action plan approved by the state tax commission that extends beyond 1 year, no earlier than May 1 and no later than September 1 of the calendar year that is the second calendar year following the year of the notice described in subdivision (a), the state tax commission shall conduct an initial follow-up review with the assessing district and, within 90 days following that review, provide the district with an evaluation of its progress in implementing its corrective action plan and a notice of substantial compliance or noncompliance with the requirements in subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (g) and (i), an assessing district that has received a notice of noncompliance as part of an initial follow-up review under subdivision (b) shall elect to either contract with the designated assessor for the county to serve as the district's assessor of record or amend its corrective action plan with the approval of the state tax commission to provide that the assessing district will employ or contract with a new assessor of record, who shall be an advanced assessing officer or a master assessing officer, to achieve and maintain substantial compliance with the requirements in subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If an assessing district amends its corrective action plan pursuant to subdivision (c), no earlier than May 1 and no later than September 1 of the following calendar year, the state tax commission shall conduct a second follow-up review with the assessing district and, within 90 days following that review, provide the district with an evaluation of its progress in implementing its corrective action plan and a notice of substantial compliance or noncompliance with the requirements in subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the state tax commission, pursuant to subdivision (b) or (d), provides an assessing district a notice of substantial compliance with the requirements in subsection (1), no further follow-up reviews are required under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (g), if the state tax commission provides an assessing district a notice of noncompliance pursuant to a second follow-up review under subdivision (d) or notifies an assessing district that it has fallen out of substantial compliance less than 5 calendar years after the calendar year a notice of substantial compliance was issued under this subsection, the state tax commission may require the assessing district to contract with the designated assessor for the county to serve as the district's assessor of record. If the state tax commission notifies an assessing district that it has fallen out of substantial compliance with the requirements in subsection (1) more than 4 calendar years after the calendar year a notice of substantial compliance was issued, that notice of noncompliance shall be treated as an initial determination of noncompliance under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Within 30 days after receiving a notice of noncompliance under subdivisions (a), (b), (d), or (f), an assessing district may file a written petition with the state tax commission challenging the determination. The state tax commission shall arbitrate the dispute based on the documented facts supporting the notice of noncompliance and the information contained in the written petition and may request additional information as needed from the assessing district. If a petition is properly filed under this subdivision, the requirements applicable to an assessing district under subdivisions (a), (c), and (f) do not apply until the state tax commission notifies the assessing district of the results of the arbitration. With respect to the corrective action plan filing requirement in subdivision (a), the 60-day window for filing the plan will run from the date of this notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Unless earlier times are agreed to by the state tax commission and the designated assessor, an assessing district that is under contract with a designated assessor under this subsection may petition the state tax commission no sooner than 3 years after commencement of the contract to end its contract with the designated assessor and may subsequently terminate the contract, subject to state tax commission approval, no sooner than 5 years after commencement of the contract. The state tax commission shall approve termination of a contract under this subdivision if it determines that the assessing district can achieve and maintain substantial compliance with the requirements in subsection (1) using a different assessor of record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the state tax commission may immediately require an assessing district to contract with the designated assessor for the county to serve as the district's assessor of record if after the expiration of 90 days following a second notice of noncompliance under subdivision (b) or the issuance of a notice of arbitration results under subdivision (g), whichever is later, the assessing district has not either contracted with the designated assessor for the county or employed or contracted with a new assessor of record pursuant to subdivision (c) or if both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The assessing district has failed to file an acceptable corrective action plan with the state tax commission under subdivision (a) within 180 days following an initial notice of noncompliance under subdivision (a) or has failed to make a good-faith effort to implement a corrective action plan approved by the state tax commission under subdivision (a) within 240 days following an initial notice of noncompliance under subdivision (a).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The failure is likely to result in assumption of the assessing district's assessment roll.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) A designated assessor may charge an assessing district that is required to contract with the designated assessor under this subsection, and that assessing district shall pay, for the reasonable costs incurred by the designated assessor in serving as the assessing district's assessor of record, including, but not limited to, the costs of overseeing and administering the annual assessment, preparing and defending the assessment roll, and operating the assessing office. The state tax commission shall develop guidelines, which, at a minimum, shall provide for the ability of an assessing district to protest a charge to the state tax commission and the ability of the state tax commission to resolve disputes between the designated assessor and the assessing district regarding costs and charges.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) A designated assessor is a local assessing unit for purposes of the provisions in section 44 concerning the division and use of any collected property tax administration fees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Beginning December 31, 2020, every county shall have a designated assessor on file with the state tax commission, subject to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Subject to subdivision (d), to designate an assessor as a designated assessor, a county shall provide the state tax commission with an interlocal agreement that designates an individual who will serve as the county's designated assessor and shall petition the state tax commission to approve of the individual as the designated assessor for that county. The interlocal agreement must be executed by the board of commissioners for that county, a majority of the assessing districts in that county, and the individual put forth as the proposed designated assessor. For purposes of this subdivision and subsection (5)(d), an assessing district is considered to be in the county where all of, or in the case of an assessing district that has state equalized value in multiple counties, the largest share of, that assessing district's state equalized value is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (d), if the state tax commission determines that an individual named in a petition submitted under subdivision (a) is capable of ensuring that contracting assessing districts achieve and maintain substantial compliance with the requirements in subsection (1), it shall approve the petition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (d), if the state tax commission determines that an individual named in a petition submitted under subdivision (a) is not capable of ensuring that contracting assessing districts achieve and maintain substantial compliance with the requirements in subsection (1), it shall reject the petition and request the submission of additional interlocal agreements under subdivision (a) until a suitable assessor has been presented.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (e), an approved designated assessor designation shall not be revoked and no new designation shall be made under subdivision (a) earlier than 5 years following the date of the approved designation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The state tax commission may designate and approve, on an interim basis and pursuant to a formal agreement, an individual to serve as a county's designated assessor and, if applicable, revoke the approved designation of the current designated assessor under the following circumstances and subject to the following time limit:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the designated assessor dies or becomes incapacitated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the designated assessor was designated and approved based on his or her employment status and that status materially changes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If it determines at any time that the designated assessor is not capable of ensuring that contracting assessing districts achieve and maintain substantial compliance with the requirements in subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) If, as of December 31, 2020, it has not been provided an interlocal agreement, executed as provided in subdivision (a), that presents a suitable individual to serve as the county's designated assessor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) An approved designation under this subdivision is effective only until a new assessor has been designated and approved under subdivisions (a) to (c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Advanced assessing officer" means an individual certified by the state tax commission pursuant to section 10d as a Michigan Advanced Assessing Officer(3) or, if the state tax commission changes its certification designations, an individual certified by the state tax commission to perform functions equivalent in scope, as determined by the state tax commission, to those that previously could have been performed by a Michigan Advanced Assessing Officer(3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Assessing district" means a city, township, or joint assessing authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Corrective action plan" means a plan developed by an assessing district that specifically indicates how the assessing district will achieve substantial compliance with the requirements in subsection (1) and when substantial compliance will be achieved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Designated assessor" means an individual designated and approved, as provided in subsection (4), to serve a county as the assessor of record for the assessing districts in that county that are required to contract with a designated assessor pursuant to the process specified in subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) "Master assessing officer" means an individual certified by the state tax commission pursuant to section 10d as a Michigan Master Assessing Officer(4) or, if the state tax commission changes its certification designations, an individual certified by the state tax commission to perform functions equivalent in scope, as determined by the state tax commission, to those that previously could have been performed by a Michigan Master Assessing Officer(4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) "Noncompliance" means that the identified deficiencies, taken together, pose a significant risk that the assessing district is unable to perform the assessing function in conformity with the state constitution and state statute. It is the opposite of substantial compliance and shall be determined based on a holistic evaluation of compliance with the requirements in subsection (1), taking into account the anticipated overall impact of the deficiencies on the assessing district's ability to perform the assessment function. A finding of noncompliance shall not be based on isolated technical deficiencies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) "Substantial compliance" means that any identified deficiencies do not pose a significant risk that the assessing district is unable to perform the assessment function in conformity with the state constitution and state statute. It is the opposite of noncompliance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Not later than 2 years after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this section, the state tax commission shall adopt and publish guidelines to implement this section. The guidelines shall include, at a minimum, minimum standards and model policies to be followed for substantial compliance with the requirements of subsection (1) and shall identify those deficiencies that may lead to a finding of noncompliance and those deficiencies that are technical. The state tax commission may update the guidelines as needed to implement this section.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Tangible personal property belonging to the estate of a deceased person, in the hands of the executors, administrators, or trustees appointed under the last will and testament of the deceased person, or by order of any court of competent jurisdiction, shall be assessed to the executors, administrators, or trustees in the local tax collecting unit and in the school district in which the deceased person resided, until the executors, administrators, or trustees give notice to the appropriate assessing officer that the estate has been distributed. If the deceased person was a nonresident of this state, the property shall be assessed in the local tax collecting unit in which it is located, to the executors, administrators, or trustees or to the person in possession of the property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Tangible personal property under the control of a trustee or agent, whether a corporation or a natural person, may be assessed to the trustee or agent in the local tax collecting unit in which the trustee or agent resides, except as otherwise provided. Personal property mortgaged or pledged is considered the property of the person in possession of that personal property and may be assessed to that person. Personal property not otherwise taxed under this act that is in the possession of any person, firm, or corporation using that property in connection with a business conducted for profit is considered the property of that person, firm, or corporation for taxation and shall be assessed to that person, firm, or corporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   For taxes levied before January 1, 2003, a building situated upon real property of the United States or of this state, or upon the real property of any person, firm, association, or corporation if the owner of the building is not the owner of the fee title to that real property, and if the value of the real property is not assessed to the owner of the building, shall be assessed as personal property to the owner or occupant of the building in the local tax collecting unit in which the real property is located. The building is subject to sale for taxes in the same manner as provided for the sale of personal property. It is not necessary to remove a building for the purpose of sale. For taxes levied after December 31, 2002, buildings and improvements, except buildings and improvements exempt under section 9f or improvements assessable under section 8(h), located upon real property of the United States or of this state, or upon the real property of any person, firm, association, or corporation if the owner of the building is not the owner of the fee title to that real property is considered real property for the purposes of taxation and assessment, and shall be assessed as real property under section 2 to the owner or occupant of the building in the local tax collecting unit in which the buildings are located if the value of the building is not otherwise included in the assessment of the real property. For taxes levied after December 31, 2001, buildings and improvements exempt under section 9f that are located upon the real property of the United States or of this state, or upon the real property of any person, firm, association, or corporation if the owner of the building is not the owner of the fee title to that real property shall be assessed as personal property to the owner or occupant of the building in the local tax collecting unit in which the real property is located.</DIV>

If tangible personal property or forest products are in transit to some place without this state, the tangible personal property or forest products shall be assessed at the local tax collecting unit in this state nearest to the last boom or sorting gap of the stream in or bordering on this state in which the tangible personal property or forest products will naturally be last floated during transit, and if the transit of the tangible personal property or forest products is to be other than through any watercourse in or bordering on this state, then the assessment shall be made in the local tax collecting unit at the point at which the tangible personal property or forest products will naturally leave this state in the ordinary course of transit. The tangible personal property or forest products in transit to any place without this state shall be assessed to the owner or the person or corporation in possession or control of the tangible personal property or forest products. If the transit of the tangible personal property or forest products will pass through the booms or sorting gaps or into the places of storage of any person or corporation operating upon any stream, then the tangible personal property or forest products may be assessed to that person or corporation. A person or corporation assessed for any tangible personal property or forest products belonging to a nonresident of this state is entitled to recover from the owner of the tangible personal property or forest products by a suit in attachment, garnishment, or for money had and received, any amount that the person or corporation assessed is compelled to pay because of the assessment, shall have a lien upon the tangible personal property or forest products as a security against loss or damage because of being assessed for the tangible personal property or forest products of another, and may retain possession of the tangible personal property or forest products until that lien is satisfied. A person or corporation assessed is not compelled to pay taxes on account of that assessment unless the appropriate assessing officer, at the time of assessment, serves notice in writing on the person or corporation in control of the premises, store, mill, dockyard, piling ground, place of storage, or warehouse that the assessment will be made. An owner or person interested in the tangible personal property or forest products may secure the release of the tangible personal property or forest products from that lien by giving to the person or corporation assessed a bond in an amount double the probable tax to be assessed on the tangible personal property or forest products, but not less than $200.00, with 2 sufficient sureties, conditioned for the payment of the tax by the owner or person interested and the saving of the person or corporation assessed from payment of the assessment and from costs, damages, and expenses on account of nonpayment, which bond as to amount and sufficiency of sureties shall be approved by the county clerk of the county in which the assessment is made.</DIV>

The purpose of such appraisal is to provide a uniform basis for the assessment of taxes throughout the county in order to apportion the burden of property taxes fairly and equitably among the owners of taxable property.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) On or before the first Monday in March in each year, the assessor shall make and complete an assessment roll, upon which he or she shall set down all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The name and address of every person liable to be taxed in the local tax collecting unit with a full description of all the real property liable to be taxed. If the name of the owner or occupant of any tract or parcel of real property is known, the assessor shall enter the name and address of the owner or occupant opposite to the description of the property. If unknown, the real property described upon the roll shall be assessed as "owner unknown". All contiguous subdivisions of any section that are owned by 1 person, firm, corporation, or other legal entity and all unimproved lots in any block that are contiguous and owned by 1 person, firm, corporation, or other legal entity shall be assessed as 1 parcel, unless demand in writing is made by the owner or occupant to have each subdivision of the section or each lot assessed separately. However, failure to assess contiguous parcels as entireties does not invalidate the assessment as made. Each description shall show as near as possible the number of acres contained in it, as determined by the assessor. It is not necessary for the assessment roll to specify the quantity of land comprised in any town, city, or village lot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The assessor shall estimate, according to his or her best information and judgment, the true cash value and assessed value of every parcel of real property and set the assessed value down opposite the parcel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The assessor shall calculate the tentative taxable value of every parcel of real property and set that value down opposite the parcel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The assessor shall determine the percentage of value of every parcel of real property that is exempt from the tax levied by a local school district for school operating purposes to the extent provided under section 1211 of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1211, and set that percentage of value down opposite the parcel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The assessor shall determine the date of the last transfer of ownership of every parcel of real property occurring after December 31, 1994 and set that date down opposite the parcel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The assessor shall estimate the true cash value of all the personal property of each person, and set the assessed value and tentative taxable value down opposite the name of the person. In determining the property to be assessed and in estimating the value of that property, the assessor is not bound to follow the statements of any person, but shall exercise his or her best judgment. For taxes levied after December 31, 2003, the assessor shall separately state the assessed value and tentative taxable value of any leasehold improvements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Property assessed to a person other than the owner shall be assessed separately from the owner's property and shall show in what capacity it is assessed to that person, whether as agent, guardian, or otherwise. Two or more persons not being copartners, owning personal property in common, may each be assessed severally for each person's portion. Undivided interests in lands owned by tenants in common, or joint tenants not being copartners, may be assessed to the owners.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to this section, a local tax collecting unit may use a computerized database system as the assessment roll described in subsection (1) if the local tax collecting unit and the assessor certify in a form and manner prescribed by the state tax commission that the proposed system has the capacity to enable a local tax collecting unit to comply and the local tax collecting unit complies with all of the following requirements: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The assessor shall certify the assessment roll and maintain a computer printed format or a disk, external drive, or other electronic data processing format compatible with the computer system used by the local tax collecting unit. The affidavit attached to or included with the assessment roll shall include documentation that the assessment roll has been backed up through a computer backup system and a sworn statement by the assessor that the backup system contains a true and complete record of the assessment roll. The affidavit attached to or included with the assessment roll shall include documentation that authorizes and reports all changes in the assessment roll as certified by the assessor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The local tax collecting unit shall certify and maintain a retention policy that complies with the requirements of section 11 of the Michigan history center act, 2016 PA 470, MCL 399.11, and section 491 of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.491.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The local tax collecting unit shall certify that the computerized database system has internal and external security procedures sufficient to assure the integrity of the system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Not later than May 1 of the third year following the year in which a local tax collecting unit begins using a computerized database system as the assessment roll in accordance with this subsection and every 3 years thereafter, the local tax collecting unit shall certify to the state tax commission that the requirements of this subsection are being met.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) An assessor or local tax collecting unit that provides a computer terminal for public viewing of the assessment roll is considered as having the assessment roll available for public inspection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) If at any time the state tax commission believes that a local tax collecting unit is no longer in compliance with this subsection, the state tax commission shall provide written notice to the local tax collecting unit. The notice shall specify the reasons that use of the computerized database system as the original assessment roll is no longer in compliance with this subsection. The local tax collecting unit has 60 days to provide evidence that the local tax collecting unit is in compliance with this subsection or that action to correct noncompliance has been implemented. If, after the expiration of 60 days, the state tax commission believes that the local tax collecting unit is not taking satisfactory steps to correct a condition of noncompliance, the state tax commission upon its own motion may withdraw approval of the use of the computerized database system as the original assessment roll. Proceedings of the state tax commission under this subsection shall be in accordance with rules for other proceedings for the commission promulgated under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, and shall not be considered a contested case.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The assessor shall give to each owner or person or persons listed on the assessment roll of the property a notice by first-class mail of an increase in the tentative state equalized valuation or the tentative taxable value for the year. The notice shall specify each parcel of property, the tentative taxable value for the current year, and the taxable value for the immediately preceding year.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    When the occupancy of a structure or improvement approved for acquisition by the appropriate units of local and federal government is subsequently vacated, the real property shall be exempt from ad valorem taxation on the tax day next following the vacation and until the property is acquired by the local public agency, the plan of acquisition is abandoned or the property is reinhabited.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the property is reoccupied for any purpose or any period during the tax year for which the exemption is applicable, the owner within 10 days following the date of reoccupancy shall so notify the local assessing officer in writing and shall pay to the treasurer of the local unit an amount equal to the amount of taxes that would have been paid on the property but for the exemption.

</P>
<P>Sec. 24e.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   As used in this section:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Additional millage rate" means a millage rate for operating purposes in excess of the millage rate permitted by subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Additions" means that term as defined in section 34d.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   "Base tax rate" means a millage rate for a local unit of government equal to the dollar amount of taxes levied for operating purposes for the concluding fiscal year from existing property divided by the taxable value of existing property for ad valorem property tax levies for the ensuing fiscal year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   "Concluding fiscal year" means the fiscal year of the taxing unit immediately preceding the fiscal year for which a limitation under this section is applied or calculated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   "Ensuing fiscal year" means the fiscal year of the taxing unit for which a limitation under this section is applied or calculated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   "Existing property" means all property against which ad valorem property taxes were levied by a local unit for its concluding fiscal year, minus all property that is considered losses for purposes of ad valorem property tax levies of the local unit for the ensuing fiscal year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   "Local unit of government" or "taxing unit" means a city, village, township, charter township, county, charter county, local school district, intermediate school district, community college district, or authority.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   "Losses" means that term as defined in section 34d.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   "Operating purposes" means all purposes for which ad valorem property taxes are levied by the taxing unit other than the levy of ad valorem property taxes to provide local school districts revenue that is deposited in a building and site fund, or to pay principal and interest due on a bond or note if and to the extent the ad valorem taxes levied for this purpose are in addition to charter or statutory limitations, as authorized by the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as provided by subsection (3), unless the taxing unit complies with section 16 of the uniform budgeting and accounting act, 1968 PA 2, MCL 141.436, the governing body of a taxing unit shall not levy ad valorem property taxes for operating purposes for an ensuing fiscal year of the taxing unit that yield an amount more than the sum of the taxes levied at the base tax rate on additions within the taxing unit for the ensuing fiscal year plus an amount equal to the taxes levied for operating purposes for the concluding fiscal year on existing property. If the taxing unit is a county, for purposes of this calculation the resulting sum shall be reduced by an amount equal to the estimate of the distribution as certified by the state treasurer to be received by the county pursuant to section 10 of the state convention facility development act, 1985 PA 106, MCL 207.630, to the extent that the distribution has been appropriated by the legislature and the estimate has been certified by the state treasurer before the final date on which a county millage rate can be certified for the ensuing year. For purposes of this section, the state treasurer shall certify an amount that is an estimate of the amount to be distributed to each county pursuant to section 10 of the state convention facility development act, 1985 PA 106, MCL 207.630.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Unless the taxing unit complies with section 16 of the uniform budgeting and accounting act, 1968 PA 2, MCL 141.436, a governing body of a taxing unit may approve a levy of an additional millage rate only after providing the notice required by subsections (6) and (9) and holding a public hearing of the governing body as prescribed by subsection (6). To approve the levy of the additional millage rate, the governing body shall adopt a separate resolution or ordinance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If, as a result of an appeal of county equalization or state equalization, the state equalized valuation of a unit of local government changes, and an incorrect amount of property taxes has been levied, the amount of additional tax revenue or the shortage of tax revenue shall be deducted from or added to the next regular tax levy for that unit of local government after the determination of the rate authorized pursuant to this section. If the legislature makes an appropriation to a county pursuant to section 10 of the state convention facility development act, 1985 PA 106, MCL 207.630, after the final date a county millage rate can be certified for the ensuing year, if an appropriation made pursuant to section 10 of the state convention facility development act, 1985 PA 106, MCL 207.630, is reduced by an executive order, or if the amount of a distribution pursuant to section 10 of the state convention facility development act, 1985 PA 106, MCL 207.630, varies from the estimated amount certified by the state treasurer pursuant to subsection (2), the amount of additional tax revenue or the shortage of tax revenue shall be deducted from or added to the next regularly estimated amount for purposes of the next required calculations under subsections (2) and (11).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If, at any time, the taxing unit determines that the published, proposed additional millage rate or an adopted additional millage rate is insufficient, the taxing unit shall readvertise, hold another public hearing of the governing body, and, if necessary, revote.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The public hearing of the governing body of a taxing unit required pursuant to subsections (3) and (5) shall be held for the purpose of receiving testimony and discussing a levy of an additional millage rate for its ensuing fiscal year. In addition to satisfying the requirements under the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275, the local unit of government or taxing unit shall publish notice of this public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the local unit of government or taxing unit. This notice shall be published not less than 6 days before the public hearing and may be jointly published with the notice of the public hearing on the taxing unit's proposed budget as required by section 2 of 1963 (2nd Ex Sess) PA 43, MCL 141.412, if both public hearings are held jointly. This notice shall specify the time, date, and place of the public hearing and shall include, in addition to other pertinent information the local unit of government or taxing unit may elect to include, a statement indicating the proposed additional millage rate, the percentage by which this proposed additional millage rate would increase revenues for operating purposes from ad valorem property tax levies permitted by operation of subsection (2), the percentage of increased revenue from the immediately preceding year that the taxing unit would receive if the additional millage rate is not approved, and that the date and location the taxing unit plans to take action on the proposed resolution or ordinance will be announced at the public hearing. This notice shall also provide a statement that the taxing unit publishing the notice has complete authority to establish the number of mills to be levied from within its authorized millage rate. The notice shall be in not less than 12-point type, shall be preceded by a headline stating "notice of a public hearing on increasing property taxes" which shall be in not less than 18-point type, shall be not less than 8 vertical column inches and 4 horizontal inches, and shall not be placed in that portion of the newspaper reserved for legal notice and classified advertisements.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The proposed additional millage rate, which is required by subsection (6) to be part of the notice of the public hearing, shall be established by a resolution adopted by the governing body of the taxing unit before conducting the public hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Not more than 10 days after a public hearing, a taxing unit may approve the levy of an additional millage rate, but shall not approve an additional millage rate that is greater than a proposed additional millage rate that was published pursuant to subsection (6) and on which the public hearing has been held.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   Each local unit shall send timely written notice of the time, date, and place of a public hearing to be held pursuant to this section to all newspapers of general circulation within the local unit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   This section shall not serve to extend or authorize the levy of ad valorem property taxes at a tax rate in excess of the maximum permitted by law, or to prevent the reduction of the tax rate either by action of the governing body of the taxing unit or pursuant to this act, including sections 34 and 34d. Reductions in millage rates that may be required by the compound operation of sections 34 and 34d shall be calculated independently of the tax rate limitation determined by operation of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   If the sum of a county's operating property tax levy for the ensuing fiscal year plus the county's distribution to be received pursuant to section 10 of the state convention facility development act, 1985 PA 106, MCL 207.630, exceeds the product of the county's taxable value for the ensuing fiscal year times the greater of the county's base tax rate or concluding fiscal year's operating millage rate, then an amount equal to the lesser of 50% of the excess or 50% of the state convention facility development act distribution shall be used for substance abuse treatment programs within the county. The proceeds received by the taxing unit shall be distributed to the coordinating agency designated for that county pursuant to section 6226 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.6226, and used only for substance abuse prevention and treatment programs in the county from which the proceeds originated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   Except as provided in subsection (13), this section applies to a fiscal year of a taxing unit for which ad valorem property taxes are levied in 1982 or in any year after 1982.

<P>Sec. 24f.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a taxing unit submits a proposal on the question of authorizing the issuance of bonds, imposing a new millage, or increasing or renewing an existing millage, except an ad valorem special assessment millage for police or fire protection under 1951 PA 33, MCL 41.801 to 41.813, the ballot shall fully disclose each local unit of government to which the revenue from that millage will be disbursed. As used in this subsection:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Local unit of government" means a county, city, village, township, school district, intermediate school district, community college district, public library, or local authority created under state law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Public library" means that term as defined in section 2 of the state aid to public libraries act, 1977 PA 89, MCL 397.552.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In addition to the requirement set forth in subsection (1) and any other requirement provided by law, when submitting a proposal on the question of authorizing a millage rate to be levied under this act, the ballot shall state all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The millage rate to be authorized.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The estimated amount of revenue that will be collected in the first year that the millage is authorized and levied.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The duration of the millage in years.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A clear statement of the purpose for the millage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   A clear statement indicating whether the proposed millage is a renewal of a previously authorized millage or the authorization of a new additional millage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In addition to any other requirement provided by law, when submitting a proposal to authorize the issuance of bonds, the ballot shall state all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The principal amount to be borrowed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The maximum number of years the bonds may be outstanding, exclusive of any refunding.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A clear statement of the purpose for which the proceeds of the bonds will be used.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   For bonds other than bonds that are intended to be paid from a separate revenue source or from taxes levied in less than the entire taxing unit, the estimated millage that will be levied for the proposed bonds in the first year that the levy is authorized and the estimated simple average annual millage that will be required to retire the debt. Inaccuracies in the estimates provided under this subdivision shall not affect the validity of the bonds, the general obligation unlimited tax status requiring the levy of taxes sufficient to pay the bonds, or the results of an election.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   For bonds that are intended to be paid from a separate revenue source or from taxes levied in less than the entire taxing unit, the primary source of the revenue that is intended to be used to retire the bonds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A taxing unit shall hold not more than 2 elections in a calendar year concerning the authorization of a millage rate greater than the product of the immediately preceding year's reduced maximum authorized rate or rates as defined in section 34d(16) multiplied by the current year's millage reduction fraction, regardless of the number of questions presented at the election.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A taxing unit that levies millage under this act shall not submit a single question to the electors of the taxing unit requesting both the renewal of voter authorized millage and the authorization of new additional millage if the additional millage is greater than 0.5 mill. If authorization to levy millage has expired and the taxing unit submits to the electors the authorization of millage greater than the number of expired mills reduced pursuant to the millage reduction in section 34d(11), and if the additional millage is greater than 0.5 mill, the taxing unit shall submit 1 question for authorization of the number of expired mills reduced pursuant to the millage reduction in section 34d(11) and 1 or more additional questions for the authorization of millage in excess of that amount.</DIV>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>211.27 "True cash value" defined; considerations in determining value; indicating exclusions from true cash value on assessment roll; subsection (2) applicable only to residential property; repairs considered normal repairs, replacement, and maintenance; exclusions from real estate sales data; classification as agricultural real property; "present economic income" defined; applicability of subsection (5); "nonprofit cooperative housing corporation" defined; value of transferred property; "purchase price" defined; additional definitions; "standard tool" defined.</B><P>Sec. 27.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As used in this act, "true cash value" means the usual selling price at the place where the property to which the term is applied is at the time of assessment, being the price that could be obtained for the property at private sale, and not at auction sale except as otherwise provided in this section, or at forced sale. The usual selling price may include sales at public auction held by a nongovernmental agency or person if those sales have become a common method of acquisition in the jurisdiction for the class of property being valued. The usual selling price does not include sales at public auction if the sale is part of a liquidation of the seller's assets in a bankruptcy proceeding or if the seller is unable to use common marketing techniques to obtain the usual selling price for the property. A sale or other disposition by this state or an agency or political subdivision of this state of land acquired for delinquent taxes or an appraisal made in connection with the sale or other disposition or the value attributed to the property of regulated public utilities by a governmental regulatory agency for rate-making purposes is not controlling evidence of true cash value for assessment purposes. In determining the true cash value, the assessor shall also consider the advantages and disadvantages of location; quality of soil; zoning; existing use; present economic income of structures, including farm structures; present economic income of land if the land is being farmed or otherwise put to income producing use; quantity and value of standing timber; water power and privileges; minerals, quarries, or other valuable deposits not otherwise exempt under this act known to be available in the land and their value. In determining the true cash value of personal property owned by an electric utility cooperative, the assessor shall consider the number of kilowatt hours of electricity sold per mile of distribution line compared to the average number of kilowatt hours of electricity sold per mile of distribution line for all electric utilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The assessor shall not consider the increase in true cash value that is a result of expenditures for normal repairs, replacement, and maintenance in determining the true cash value of property for assessment purposes until the property is sold. For the purpose of implementing this subsection, the assessor shall not increase the construction quality classification or reduce the effective age for depreciation purposes, except if the appraisal of the property was erroneous before nonconsideration of the normal repair, replacement, or maintenance, and shall not assign an economic condition factor to the property that differs from the economic condition factor assigned to similar properties as defined by appraisal procedures applied in the jurisdiction. The increase in value attributable to the items included in subdivisions (a) to (q) that is known to the assessor and excluded from true cash value must be indicated on the assessment roll. This subsection applies only to residential property. The following repairs are considered normal maintenance if they are not part of a structural addition or completion:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Outside painting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Repairing or replacing siding, roof, porches, steps, sidewalks, or drives.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Repainting, repairing, or replacing existing masonry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Replacing awnings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Adding or replacing gutters and downspouts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Replacing storm windows or doors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Insulating or weatherstripping.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Complete rewiring.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Replacing plumbing and light fixtures.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Replacing a furnace with a new furnace of the same type or replacing an oil or gas burner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) Repairing plaster, inside painting, or other redecorating.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) New ceiling, wall, or floor surfacing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) Removing partitions to enlarge rooms.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) Replacing an automatic hot water heater.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(o) Replacing dated interior woodwork.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(p) Installing, replacing, or repairing an alternative energy system, without regard to ownership of the system, with a generating capacity of not more than 150 kilowatts, the annual energy output of which does not exceed the annual energy consumption measured by the utility-provided electrical meter on the system to which it is connected. As used in this subdivision, "alternative energy system" means that term as defined in section 2 of the Michigan next energy authority act, 2002 PA 593, MCL 207.822.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(q) Installing, replacing, or repairing a whole-home generator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A city or township assessor, a county equalization department, or the state tax commission before utilizing real estate sales data on real property purchases, including purchases by land contract, to determine assessments or in making sales ratio studies to assess property or equalize assessments shall exclude from the sales data the following amounts allowed by subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) to the extent that the amounts are included in the real property purchase price and are so identified in the real estate sales data or certified to the assessor as provided in subdivision (d):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Amounts paid for obtaining financing of the purchase price of the property or the last conveyance of the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Amounts attributable to personal property that were included in the purchase price of the property in the last conveyance of the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Amounts paid for surveying the property pursuant to the last conveyance of the property. The legislature may require local units of government, including school districts, to submit reports of revenue lost under subdivisions (a) and (b) and this subdivision so that the state may reimburse those units for that lost revenue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The purchaser of real property, including a purchaser by land contract, may file with the assessor of the city or township in which the property is located 2 copies of the purchase agreement or of an affidavit that identifies the amount, if any, for each item listed in subdivisions (a) to (c). The assessor shall forward 1 copy to the county equalization department. The affidavit must be as prescribed by the state tax commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In finalizing sales studies for property classified as agricultural real property under section 34c, an assessor and equalization director shall determine if an affidavit for the property has been filed under section 27a(7)(o). If an affidavit has not been filed, the property must be reviewed to determine if classification as agricultural real property under section 34c is correct or should be changed. The assessor for the local tax collecting unit in which the property is located shall contact the property owner to determine why the property owner did not file an affidavit under section 27a(7)(o). Unless there are convincing facts to the contrary, the sale of property classified as agricultural real property under section 34c for which an affidavit under section 27a(7)(o) has not been filed must not be included in a sales study.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) As used in subsection (1), "present economic income" means for leased or rented property the ordinary, general, and usual economic return realized from the lease or rental of property negotiated under current, contemporary conditions between parties equally knowledgeable and familiar with real estate values. The actual income generated by the lease or rental of property is not the controlling indicator of its true cash value in all cases. This subsection does not apply to property subject to a lease entered into before January 1, 1984 for which the terms of the lease governing the rental rate or tax liability have not been renegotiated after December 31, 1983. This subsection does not apply to a nonprofit housing cooperative subject to regulatory agreements between the state or federal government entered into before January 1, 1984. As used in this subsection, "nonprofit cooperative housing corporation" means a nonprofit cooperative housing corporation that is engaged in providing housing services to its stockholders and members and that does not pay dividends or interest upon stock or membership investment but that does distribute all earnings to its stockholders or members.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (7), the purchase price paid in a transfer of property is not the presumptive true cash value of the property transferred. In determining the true cash value of transferred property, an assessing officer shall assess that property using the same valuation method used to value all other property of that same classification in the assessing jurisdiction. As used in this subsection and subsection (7), "purchase price" means the total consideration agreed to in an arms-length transaction and not at a forced sale paid by the purchaser of the property, stated in dollars, whether or not paid in dollars.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For a transfer of eligible nonprofit housing property from a charitable nonprofit housing organization to a low-income person that occurs after December 31, 2010 through December 30, 2021, the purchase price paid is the presumptive true cash value of the eligible nonprofit housing property transferred. For a transfer of eligible nonprofit housing property from a charitable nonprofit housing organization to a low-income person that occurs on or after December 31, 2021, the loan amount stated in the closing disclosure form for the transfer is the presumptive true cash value of the eligible nonprofit housing property transferred. In the year immediately succeeding the year in which the transfer of eligible nonprofit housing property occurs and each year thereafter, the taxable value of the eligible nonprofit housing property must be adjusted as provided under section 27a. As used in this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Charitable nonprofit housing organization" means a charitable nonprofit organization the primary purpose of which is the construction or renovation of residential housing for conveyance to a low-income person.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Eligible nonprofit housing property" means property owned by a charitable nonprofit housing organization, the ownership of which the charitable nonprofit housing organization intends to transfer to a low-income person after construction or renovation of the property is completed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Family income" and "statewide median gross income" mean those terms as defined in section 11 of the state housing development authority act of 1966, 1966 PA 346, MCL 125.1411.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Low-income person" means a person with a family income of not more than 80% of the statewide median gross income who is eligible to participate in the charitable nonprofit housing organization's program based on criteria established by the charitable nonprofit housing organization.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) For purposes of a statement submitted under section 19, the true cash value of a standard tool is the net book value of that standard tool as of December 31 in each tax year as determined using generally accepted accounting principles in a manner consistent with the established depreciation method used by the person submitting that statement. The net book value of a standard tool for federal income tax purposes is not the presumptive true cash value of that standard tool. As used in this subsection, "standard tool" means that term as defined in section 9b.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, property shall be assessed at 50% of its true cash value under section 3 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3), for taxes levied in 1995 and for each year after 1995, the taxable value of each parcel of property is the lesser of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The property's taxable value in the immediately preceding year minus any losses, multiplied by the lesser of 1.05 or the inflation rate, plus all additions. For taxes levied in 1995, the property's taxable value in the immediately preceding year is the property's state equalized valuation in 1994.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The property's current state equalized valuation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Upon a transfer of ownership of property after 1994, the property's taxable value for the calendar year following the year of the transfer is the property's state equalized valuation for the calendar year following the transfer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the taxable value of property is adjusted under subsection (3), a subsequent increase in the property's taxable value is subject to the limitation set forth in subsection (2) until a subsequent transfer of ownership occurs. If the taxable value of property is adjusted under subsection (3) and the assessor determines that there had not been a transfer of ownership, the taxable value of the property shall be adjusted at the July or December board of review. Notwithstanding the limitation provided in section 53b(1) on the number of years for which a correction may be made, the July or December board of review may adjust the taxable value of property under this subsection for the current year and for the 3 immediately preceding calendar years. A corrected tax bill shall be issued for each tax year for which the taxable value is adjusted by the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of the tax roll or by the county treasurer if the county has possession of the tax roll. For purposes of section 53b, an adjustment under this subsection shall be considered the correction of a clerical error. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Assessment of property, as required in this section and section 27, is inapplicable to the assessment of property subject to the levy of ad valorem taxes within voted tax limitation increases to pay principal and interest on limited tax bonds issued by any governmental unit, including a county, township, community college district, or school district, before January 1, 1964, if the assessment required to be made under this act would be less than the assessment as state equalized prevailing on the property at the time of the issuance of the bonds. This inapplicability continues until levy of taxes to pay principal and interest on the bonds is no longer required. The assessment of property required by this act applies for all other purposes.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the buyer, grantee, or other transferee in the immediately preceding transfer of ownership of property does not notify the appropriate assessing office as required by section 27a(10), the property's taxable value shall be adjusted under section 27a(3) and all of the following shall be levied:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Any additional taxes that would have been levied if the transfer of ownership had been recorded as required under this act from the date of transfer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Interest and penalty from the date the tax would have been originally levied.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For property classified under section 34c as either industrial real property or commercial real property, a penalty in the following amount:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (ii), if the sale price of the property transferred is $100,000,000.00 or less, $20.00 per day for each separate failure beginning after the 45 days have elapsed, up to a maximum of $1,000.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the sale price of the property transferred is more than $100,000,000.00, $20,000.00 after the 45 days have elapsed. However, if the appropriate assessing office determines that the failure to notify the assessing office within 45 days after the property's transfer of ownership was due to reasonable cause and not the willful neglect of the buyer, grantee, or other transferee, the penalty under subparagraph (i) shall be imposed. If the appropriate assessing office makes a determination that the failure to notify the assessing office within 45 days after the property's transfer of ownership was a result of the willful neglect of the buyer, grantee, or other transferee, that assessing office shall promptly send that buyer, grantee, or other transferee written notice, by certified mail, of that determination. A buyer, grantee, or other transferee who is assessed the penalty under this subparagraph may appeal that determination to the Michigan tax tribunal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) For real property other than real property classified under section 34c as industrial real property or commercial real property, a penalty of $5.00 per day for each separate failure beginning after the 45 days have elapsed, up to a maximum of $200.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The appropriate assessing officer shall certify for collection to the treasurer of the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of the tax roll or the county treasurer if the county has possession of the tax roll any additional taxes due under subsection (1)(a) and any penalty due under subsection (1)(c) or (d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The treasurer of the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of the tax roll or the county treasurer if the county has possession of the tax roll shall collect any taxes, interest, and penalty due pursuant to this section, and shall immediately prepare and submit a corrected tax bill for any additional taxes due under subsection (1)(a) and any interest and penalty due under subsection (1)(b). A penalty due under subsection (1)(c) or (d) may be collected with the immediately succeeding regular tax bill.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Any taxes, interest, and penalty collected pursuant to subsection (1)(a) and (b) shall be distributed in the same manner as other delinquent taxes, interest, and penalties are distributed under this act. Any penalty collected under subsection (1)(c) or (d) shall be distributed to the local tax collecting unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The governing body of a local tax collecting unit may waive, by resolution, the penalty levied under subsection (1)(c) or (d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the taxable value of property is increased under this section, the appropriate assessing officer shall immediately notify by first-class mail the owner of that property of that increase in taxable value. A buyer, grantee, or other transferee may appeal any increase in taxable value or the levy of any additional taxes, interest, and penalties under subsection (1) to the Michigan tax tribunal within 35 days of receiving the notice of the increase in the property's taxable value. An appeal under this subsection is limited to the issues of whether a transfer of ownership has occurred and correcting arithmetic errors. A dispute regarding the valuation of the property is not a basis for appeal under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the taxable value of property is adjusted under subsection (1), the assessing officer making the adjustment shall file an affidavit with all officials responsible for determining assessment figures, rate of taxation, or mathematical calculations for that property within 30 days of the date the adjustment is made. The affidavit shall state the amount of the adjustment and the amount of additional taxes levied. The officials with whom the affidavit is filed shall correct all official records for which they are responsible to reflect the adjustment and levy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Notification of a transfer of ownership provided as required under section 27a(10) or a levy of additional taxes, interest, and penalty under this section shall not be considered a determination of or evidence of the classification of the property transferred as real or personal property.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 34.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The county board of commissioners in each county shall meet in April each year to determine county equalized value which equalization shall be completed and submitted along with the tabular statement required by section 5 of Act No. 44 of the Public Acts of 1911, being section 209.5 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, to the state tax commission before the first Monday in May. The business which the board may perform shall be conducted at a public meeting of the board held in compliance with the open meetings act, Act No. 267 of the Public Acts of 1976, as amended, being sections 15.261 to 15.275 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. Public notice of the time, date, and place of the meeting shall be given in the manner required by Act No. 267 of the Public Acts of 1976, as amended. Each year the county board of commissioners shall advise the local taxing units when the state tax commission increases the equalized value of the county as established by the board of county commissioners and each taxing unit other than a city, township, school district, intermediate school district, or community college district, shall immediately reduce its maximum authorized millage rate, as determined after any reduction caused by section 34d, so that subsequent to the increase ordered by the state tax commission pursuant to Act No. 44 of the Public Acts of 1911, as amended, being sections 209.1 to 209.8 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, total property taxes levied for that unit shall not exceed that which would have been levied for that unit at its maximum authorized millage rate, as determined after any reduction caused by section 34d, if there had not been an increase in valuation by the state. If its state equalized valuation exceeds its assessed valuation by 5.0% or more in 1982 or by any amount in 1983 or any year thereafter, a city or township shall reduce its maximum authorized millage rate, as determined after any reduction caused by section 34d, so that total property taxes levied for that unit do not exceed that which would have been levied based on its assessed valuation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The county board of commissioners shall examine the assessment rolls of the townships or cities and ascertain whether the real and personal property in the respective townships or cities has been equally and uniformly assessed at true cash value. If, on the examination, the county board of commissioners considers the assessments to be relatively unequal, it shall equalize the assessments by adding to or deducting from the valuation of the taxable property in a township or city an amount which in the judgment of the county board of commissioners will produce a sum which represents the true cash value of that property, and the amount added to or deducted from the valuations in a township or city shall be entered upon the records. The county board of commissioners and the state tax commission shall equalize real and personal property separately by adding to or deducting from the valuation of taxable real property, and by adding to or deducting from the valuation of taxable personal property in a township, city, or county, an amount which will produce a sum which represents the proportion of true cash value established by the legislature. Beginning December 31, 1980, the county board of commissioners and the state tax commission shall equalize separately the following classes of real property by adding to or deducting from the valuation of agricultural, developmental, residential, commercial, industrial, and timber cutover taxable real property, and by adding to or deducting from the valuation of taxable personal property in a township, city, or county, an amount as will produce a sum which represents the proportion of true cash value established by the legislature. The tax roll and the tax statement shall clearly set forth the latest state equalized valuation for each item or property which shall be determined by using a separate factor for personal property and a separate factor for real property as equalized. Beginning December 31, 1980, the tax roll and the tax statement shall clearly set forth the latest state equalized valuation for each item or property which shall be determined by using a separate factor for personal property and a separate factor for each classification for real property as equalized. Factors used in determining the state equalized valuation for real and personal property on the tax roll shall be rounded up to not less than 4 decimal places. Equalized values for both real and personal property shall be equalized uniformly at the same proportion of true cash value in the county. The county board of commissioners shall also cause to be entered upon its records the aggregate valuation of the taxable real and personal property of each township or city in its county as determined by the county board. The county board of commissioners shall also make alterations in the description of any land on the rolls as is necessary to render the descriptions conformable to the requirements of this act. After the rolls are equalized, each shall be certified to by the chairperson and the clerk of the board and be delivered to the supervisor of the proper township or city, who shall file and keep the roll in his or her office.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The county board of commissioners of a county shall establish and maintain a department to survey assessments and assist the board of commissioners in the matter of equalization of assessments, and may employ in that department technical and clerical personnel which in its judgment are considered necessary. The personnel of the department shall be under the direct supervision and control of a director of the tax or equalization department who may designate an employee of the department as his or her deputy. The director of the county tax or equalization department shall be appointed by the county board of commissioners. The county board of commissioners, through the department, may furnish assistance to local assessing officers in the performance of duties imposed upon those officers by this act, including the development and maintenance of accurate property descriptions, the discovery, listing, and valuation of properties for tax purposes, and the development and use of uniform valuation standards and techniques for the assessment of property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The supervisor of a township or, with the approval of the governing body, the certified assessor of a township or city, or the intermediate district board of education, or the board of education of an incorporated city or village aggrieved by the action of the county board of commissioners, in equalizing the valuations of the townships or cities of the county, may appeal from the determination to the state tax tribunal in the manner provided by law. An appeal from the determination by the county board of commissioners shall be filed with the clerk of the tribunal by a written or printed petition which shall set forth in detail the reasons for taking the appeal. The petition shall be signed and sworn to by the supervisor, the certified assessor, or a majority of the members of the board of education taking the appeal, shall show that a certain township, city, or school district has been discriminated against in the equalization, and shall pray that the state tax tribunal proceed at its earliest convenience to review the action from which the appeal is taken. The state tax tribunal shall, upon hearing, determine if in its judgment there is a showing that the equalization complained of is unfair, unjust, inequitable, or discriminatory. The state tax tribunal shall have the same authority to consider and pass upon the action and determination of the county board of commissioners in equalizing valuations as it has to consider complaints relative to the assessment and taxation of property. The state tax tribunal may order the county board of commissioners to reconvene and to cause the assessment rolls of the county to be brought before it, may summon the commissioners of the county to give evidence in relation to the equalization, and may take further action and may make further investigation in the premises as it considers necessary. The state tax tribunal shall fix a valuation on all property of the county. If the state tax tribunal decides that the determination and equalization made by the county board of commissioners is correct, further action shall not be taken. If the state tax tribunal, after the hearing, decides that the valuations of the county were improperly equalized, it shall proceed to make deductions from, or additions to, the valuations of the respective townships, cities, or school districts as may be considered proper, and in so doing the tribunal shall have the same powers as the county board of commissioners had in the first instance. The deductions or additions shall decrease or increase the state equalized valuation of the local unit affected but shall not increase or decrease the total state equalized valuation of the county in the case of an appeal under this section to the state tax tribunal. If the tax tribunal finds that the valuations of a class of property in a county were improperly equalized by that county and determines that the total value of that class of property in the county may not be at the level required by law, prior to entry of a final order, the tax tribunal shall forward its findings and determination to the state tax commission. Within 90 days after receiving the findings and determination of the tax tribunal, the state tax commission shall determine whether the state equalized valuation of that class of property in the county was set at the level prescribed by law or should be revised to provide uniformity among the counties and shall enter an order consistent with the state tax commission's findings. The tax tribunal shall enter a final order based upon the revised state equalized valuation, if any, which is adopted by the state tax commission. The state tax tribunal immediately after completing its revision of the equalization of the valuation of the several assessment districts shall report its action to the county board of commissioners and board of education if the board has instituted the appeal by filing its report with the clerk of the county board of commissioners. The action of the state tax tribunal in the premises shall constitute the equalization of the county for the tax year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   For purposes of appeals pursuant to subsection (4) in 1981 only, an agent of a supervisor, including an assessor, shall be considered to have the authority to file and sign a petition for an appeal, and any otherwise timely submitted petition in 1981 by an agent of a supervisor shall be reviewed by the tribunal as if submitted by the supervisor.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 34a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The equalization director of each county shall prepare a tabular statement each year, by the several cities and townships of the county, showing the tentative recommended equalization ratios and estimated multipliers necessary to compute individual state equalized valuation of real property and of personal property. The county shall publish the tabulation in a newspaper of general circulation within the county on or before the third Monday in February each year and furnish a copy to each assessor and to each of the boards of review in the county and to the state tax commission. All notices of meetings of the boards of review shall give the tentative ratios and estimated multipliers pertaining to their jurisdiction. The tentative recommended equalization ratios and multiplying figures shall not prejudice the equalization procedures of the county board of commissioners or the state tax commission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the final equalization multiplier for only the 1986 tax year exceeds the tentative multiplier used in preparing the assessment notice and as a result of action of the state board of equalization or county board of commissioners a taxpayer's assessment as equalized is in excess of 50% of true cash value, that person may appeal directly to the tax tribunal. The appeal shall be filed under this subsection during 1986 on or before the third Monday in August and shall be heard in the same manner as other appeals of the tribunal. An appeal pursuant to this subsection shall not result in an equalized value less than the assesed value multiplied by the tentative equalization multiplier used in preparing the assessment notice.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Not later than the first Monday in March in each year, the assessor shall classify every item of assessable property according to the definitions contained in this section. Following the March board of review, the assessor shall tabulate the total number of items and the valuations as approved by the board of review for each classification and for the totals of real and personal property in the local tax collecting unit. The assessor shall transmit to the county equalization department and to the state tax commission the tabulation of assessed valuations and other statistical information the state tax commission considers necessary to meet the requirements of this act and 1911 PA 44, MCL 209.1 to 209.8.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The classifications of assessable real property are described as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Agricultural real property includes parcels used partially or wholly for agricultural operations, with or without buildings. For taxes levied after December 31, 2002, agricultural real property includes buildings on leased land used for agricultural operations. If a parcel of real property is classified as agricultural real property and is engaged in agricultural operations, any contiguous parcel owned by the same taxpayer, that is a vacant parcel, a wooded parcel, or a parcel on which is located 1 or more agricultural outbuildings that comprise more than 50% of the taxable value of all buildings on that parcel as indicated by the assessment records for the local tax collecting unit in which that parcel is located, shall be classified as agricultural real property. Contiguity is not broken by a boundary between local tax collecting units, a section boundary, a road, a right-of-way, or property purchased or taken under condemnation proceedings by a public utility for power transmission lines if the 2 parcels separated by the purchased or condemned property were a single parcel prior to the sale or condemnation. For purposes of this subsection, contiguity requires that the parcel classified as agricultural real property by reason of its agriculture use and the vacant parcel, wooded parcel, or parcel on which is located 1 or more agricultural outbuildings must be immediately adjacent to each other, without intervening parcels that do not qualify for classification as agricultural real property based on their actual agricultural use. It is the intent of the legislature that if a parcel of real property is classified as agricultural real property and is engaged in agricultural operations, any contiguous parcel owned by the same taxpayer, that is a vacant parcel, a wooded parcel, or a parcel on which is located 1 or more agricultural outbuildings that comprise more than 50% of the taxable value of all buildings on that parcel as indicated by the assessment records for the local tax collecting unit in which that parcel is located, shall be classified as agricultural real property even if the contiguous parcels are located in different local tax collecting units. Property shall not lose its classification as agricultural real property as a result of an owner or lessee of that property implementing a wildlife risk mitigation action plan. As used in this subdivision:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As used in this section or section 27a, or section 3 or 31 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For taxes levied before 1995, "additions" means all increases in value caused by new construction or a physical addition of equipment or furnishings, and the value of property that was exempt from taxes or not included on the assessment unit's immediately preceding year's assessment roll.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For taxes levied after 1994, "additions" means, except as provided in subdivision (c), all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Omitted real property. As used in this subparagraph, "omitted real property" means previously existing tangible real property not included in the assessment. Omitted real property does not increase taxable value as an addition unless the assessing jurisdiction has a property record card or other documentation showing that the omitted real property was not previously included in the assessment. The assessing jurisdiction has the burden of proof in establishing whether the omitted real property is included in the assessment. Omitted real property for the current and the 2 immediately preceding years, discovered after the assessment roll has been completed, must be added to the tax roll pursuant to the procedures established in section 154. For purposes of determining the taxable value of real property under section 27a, the value of omitted real property is based on the value and the ratio of taxable value to true cash value the omitted real property would have had if the property had not been omitted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Omitted personal property. As used in this subparagraph, "omitted personal property" means previously existing tangible personal property not included in the assessment. Omitted personal property must be added to the tax roll pursuant to section 154.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) New construction. As used in this subparagraph, "new construction" means property not in existence on the immediately preceding tax day and not replacement construction. New construction includes the physical addition of equipment or furnishings, subject to the provisions set forth in section 27(2)(a) to (q). For purposes of determining the taxable value of property under section 27a, the value of new construction is the true cash value of the new construction multiplied by 0.50.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Previously exempt property. As used in this subparagraph, "previously exempt property" means property that was exempt from ad valorem taxation under this act on the immediately preceding tax day but is subject to ad valorem taxation on the current tax day under this act. For purposes of determining the taxable value of real property under section 27a: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) The value of property previously exempt under section 7u is the taxable value the entire parcel of property would have had if that property had not been exempt, minus the product of the entire parcel's taxable value in the immediately preceding year and the lesser of 1.05 or the inflation rate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) The taxable value of property that is a facility as that term is defined in section 2 of 1974 PA 198, MCL 207.552, that was previously exempt under section 7k is the taxable value that property would have had under this act if it had not been exempt. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(C) The value of property previously exempt under any other section of law is the true cash value of the previously exempt property multiplied by 0.50. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Replacement construction. As used in this subparagraph, "replacement construction" means construction that replaced property damaged or destroyed by accident or act of God and that occurred after the immediately preceding tax day to the extent the construction's true cash value does not exceed the true cash value of property that was damaged or destroyed by accident or act of God in the immediately preceding 3 years. Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, for purposes of determining the taxable value of property under section 27a, the value of the replacement construction is the true cash value of the replacement construction multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the taxable value of the property to which the construction was added in the immediately preceding year and the denominator of which is the true cash value of the property to which the construction was added in the immediately preceding year, and then multiplied by the lesser of 1.05 or the inflation rate. However, after December 31, 2011, for purposes of determining the taxable value of property under section 27a, if the property's replacement construction is of substantially the same materials as determined by the state tax commission, if the square footage is not more than 5% greater than the property that was damaged or destroyed, and if the replacement construction is completed not later than December 31 in the year 3 years after the accident or act of God occurred, the replacement construction's taxable value is equal to the taxable value of the property in the year immediately preceding the year in which the property was damaged or destroyed, adjusted annually as provided in section 27a(2). Any construction materials required to bring the property into compliance with any applicable health, sanitary, zoning, safety, fire, or construction codes or ordinances must be considered to be substantially the same materials by the state tax commission for the sake of replacement construction under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) An increase in taxable value attributable to the complete or partial remediation of environmental contamination existing on the immediately preceding tax day. The department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy shall determine the degree of remediation based on information available in existing department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy records or information made available to the department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy if the appropriate assessing officer for a local tax collecting unit requests that determination. The increase in taxable value attributable to the remediation is the increase in true cash value attributable to the remediation multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the taxable value of the property had it not been contaminated and the denominator of which is the true cash value of the property had it not been contaminated. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vii) Public services. As used in this subparagraph, "public services" means water service, sewer service, a primary access road, natural gas service, electrical service, telephone service, sidewalks, or street lighting. For purposes of determining the taxable value of real property under section 27a, the value of public services is the amount of increase in true cash value of the property attributable to the available public services multiplied by 0.50, and must be added in the calendar year following the calendar year when those public services are initially available.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For taxes levied after 1994, additions do not include increased value attributable to any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Platting, splits, or combinations of property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A change in the zoning of property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) For the purposes of the calculation of the millage reduction fraction under subsection (7) only, increased taxable value under section 27a(3) after a transfer of ownership of property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Assessed valuation of property as finally equalized" means taxable value under section 27a. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) "Financial officer" means the officer responsible for preparing the budget of a unit of local government.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) "General price level" means the annual average of the 12 monthly values for the United States Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers as defined and officially reported by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) For taxes levied before 1995, "losses" means a decrease in value caused by the removal or destruction of real or personal property and the value of property taxed in the immediately preceding year that has been exempted or removed from the assessment unit's assessment roll.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) For taxes levied after 1994, "losses" means, except as provided in subdivision (i), all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Property that has been destroyed or removed. For purposes of determining the taxable value of property under section 27a, the value of property destroyed or removed is the product of the true cash value of that property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the taxable value of that property in the immediately preceding year and the denominator of which is the true cash value of that property in the immediately preceding year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Property that was subject to ad valorem taxation under this act in the immediately preceding year that is now exempt from ad valorem taxation under this act. For purposes of determining the taxable value of property under section 27a, the value of property exempted from ad valorem taxation under this act is the amount exempted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Before December 31, 2013, an adjustment in value, if any, because of a decrease in the property's occupancy rate, to the extent provided by law. For purposes of determining the taxable value of real property under section 27a, the value of a loss for a decrease in the property's occupancy rate is the product of the decrease in the true cash value of the property attributable to the decreased occupancy rate multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the taxable value of the property in the immediately preceding year and the denominator of which is the true cash value of the property in the immediately preceding year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) A decrease in taxable value attributable to environmental contamination existing on the immediately preceding tax day. The department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy shall determine the degree to which environmental contamination limits the use of property based on information available in existing department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy records or information made available to the department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy if the appropriate assessing officer for a local tax collecting unit requests that determination. The department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy's determination of the degree to which environmental contamination limits the use of property must be based on the criteria established for the categories set forth in section 20120a(1) of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.20120a. The decrease in taxable value attributable to the contamination is the decrease in true cash value attributable to the contamination multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the taxable value of the property had it not been contaminated and the denominator of which is the true cash value of the property had it not been contaminated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) For taxes levied after 1994, losses do not include decreased value attributable to either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Platting, splits, or combinations of property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A change in the zoning of property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) "New construction and improvements" means additions less losses. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) "Current year" means the year for which the millage limitation is being calculated. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) "Inflation rate" means the ratio of the general price level for the state fiscal year ending in the calendar year immediately preceding the current year divided by the general price level for the state fiscal year ending in the calendar year before the year immediately preceding the current year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) On or before the first Monday in May of each year, the assessing officer of each township or city shall tabulate the tentative taxable value as approved by the local board of review and as modified by county equalization for each classification of property that is separately equalized for each unit of local government and provide the tabulated tentative taxable values to the county equalization director. The tabulation by the assessing officer must contain additions and losses for each classification of property that is separately equalized for each unit of local government or part of a unit of local government in the township or city. If as a result of state equalization the taxable value of property changes, the assessing officer of each township or city shall revise the calculations required by this subsection on or before the Friday following the fourth Monday in May. The county equalization director shall compute these amounts and the current and immediately preceding year's taxable values for each classification of property that is separately equalized for each unit of local government that levies taxes under this act within the boundary of the county. The county equalization director shall cooperate with equalization directors of neighboring counties, as necessary, to make the computation for units of local government located in more than 1 county. The county equalization director shall calculate the millage reduction fraction for each unit of local government in the county for the current year. The financial officer for each taxing jurisdiction shall calculate the compounded millage reduction fractions beginning in 1980 resulting from the multiplication of successive millage reduction fractions and shall recognize a local voter action to increase the compounded millage reduction fraction to a maximum of 1 as a new beginning fraction. Upon request of the superintendent of the intermediate school district, the county equalization director shall transmit the complete computations of the taxable values to the superintendent of the intermediate school district within that county. At the request of the presidents of community colleges, the county equalization director shall transmit the complete computations of the taxable values to the presidents of community colleges within the county. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) On or before the first Monday in June of each year, the county equalization director shall deliver the statement of the computations signed by the county equalization director to the county treasurer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) On or before the second Monday in June of each year, the treasurer of each county shall certify the immediately preceding year's taxable values, the current year's taxable values, the amount of additions and losses for the current year, and the current year's millage reduction fraction for each unit of local government that levies a property tax in the county.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The financial officer of each unit of local government shall make the computation of the tax rate using the data certified by the county treasurer and the state tax commission. At the annual session in October, or, for a county or local tax collecting unit that approves under section 44a(2) the accelerated collection in a summer property tax levy of a millage that had been previously billed and collected as in a preceding tax year as part of the winter property tax levy, before a special meeting held before the annual levy on July 1, the county board of commissioners shall not authorize the levy of a tax unless the governing body of the taxing jurisdiction has certified that the requested millage has been reduced, if necessary, in compliance with section 31 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The number of mills permitted to be levied in a tax year is limited as provided in this section pursuant to section 31 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963. A unit of local government shall not levy a tax rate greater than the rate determined by reducing its maximum rate or rates authorized by law or charter by a millage reduction fraction as provided in this section without voter approval.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A millage reduction fraction must be determined for each year for each local unit of government. For ad valorem property taxes that became a lien before January 1, 1983, the numerator of the fraction is the total state equalized valuation for the immediately preceding year multiplied by the inflation rate and the denominator of the fraction is the total state equalized valuation for the current year minus new construction and improvements. For ad valorem property taxes that become a lien after December 31, 1982 and through December 31, 1994, the numerator of the fraction is the product of the difference between the total state equalized valuation for the immediately preceding year minus losses multiplied by the inflation rate and the denominator of the fraction is the total state equalized valuation for the current year minus additions. For ad valorem property taxes that are levied after December 31, 1994, the numerator of the fraction is the product of the difference between the total taxable value for the immediately preceding year minus losses multiplied by the inflation rate and the denominator of the fraction is the total taxable value for the current year minus additions. For each year after 1993, a millage reduction fraction must not exceed 1.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The compounded millage reduction fraction must be calculated by multiplying the local unit's previous year's compounded millage reduction fraction by the current year's millage reduction fraction. The compounded millage reduction fraction for the year must be multiplied by the maximum millage rate authorized by law or charter for the unit of local government for the year, except as provided by subsection (9). A compounded millage reduction fraction must not exceed 1.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The millage reduction must be determined separately for authorized millage approved by the voters. The limitation on millage authorized by the voters on or before April 30 of a year must be calculated beginning with the millage reduction fraction for that year. Millage authorized by the voters after April 30 is not subject to a millage reduction until the year following the voter authorization which must be calculated beginning with the millage reduction fraction for the year following the authorization. The first millage reduction fraction used in calculating the limitation on millage approved by the voters after January 1, 1979 must not exceed 1.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A millage reduction fraction must be applied separately to the aggregate maximum millage rate authorized by a charter and to each maximum millage rate authorized by state law for a specific purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A unit of local government may submit to the voters for their approval the levy in that year of a tax rate in excess of the limit set by this section. The ballot question must ask the voters to approve the levy of a specific number of mills in excess of the limit. The provisions of this section do not allow the levy of a millage rate in excess of the maximum rate authorized by law or charter. If the authorization to levy millage expires after 1993 and a local governmental unit is asking voters to renew the authorization to levy the millage, the ballot question must ask for renewed authorization for the number of expiring mills as reduced by the millage reduction required by this section. If the election occurs before June 1 of a year, the millage reduction is based on the immediately preceding year's millage reduction applicable to that millage. If the election occurs after May 31 of a year, the millage reduction must be based on that year's millage reduction applicable to that millage had it not expired.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A reduction or limitation under this section must not be applied to taxes imposed for the payment of principal and interest on bonds or other evidence of indebtedness or for the payment of assessments or contract obligations in anticipation of which bonds are issued that were authorized before December 23, 1978, as provided by section 4 of chapter I of former 1943 PA 202, or to taxes imposed for the payment of principal and interest on bonds or other evidence of indebtedness or for the payment of assessments or contract obligations in anticipation of which bonds are issued that are approved by the voters after December 22, 1978. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) If it is determined after the levy of a tax that an incorrect millage reduction fraction has been applied, the amount of additional tax revenue or the shortage of tax revenue must be deducted from or added to the next regular tax levy for that unit of local government after the determination of the authorized rate pursuant to this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) If as a result of an appeal of county equalization or state equalization the taxable value of a unit of local government changes, the millage reduction fraction for the year must be recalculated. The financial officer shall effectuate an addition or reduction of tax revenue in the same manner as prescribed in subsection (13).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) The fractions calculated pursuant to this section must be rounded to 4 decimal places, except that the inflation rate must be computed by the state tax commission and must be rounded to 3 decimal places. The state tax commission shall publish the inflation rate before March 1 of each year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) Beginning with taxes levied in 1994, the millage reduction required by section 31 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 permanently reduces the maximum rate or rates authorized by law or charter. The reduced maximum authorized rate or rates for 1994 must equal the product of the maximum rate or rates authorized by law or charter before application of this section multiplied by the compounded millage reduction applicable to that millage in 1994 pursuant to subsections (8) to (12). The reduced maximum authorized rate or rates for 1995 and each year after 1995 must equal the product of the immediately preceding year's reduced maximum authorized rate or rates multiplied by the current year's millage reduction fraction and must be adjusted for millage for which authorization has expired and new authorized millage approved by the voters pursuant to subsections (8) to (12).</div>

Am. 2022, Act 240, Imd. Eff. Dec. 14, 2022 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> MCL 211.34d(i)(b)(vii) is unconstitutional because it purports to define the term “additions” for purposes of Const 1963, art IX, § 3 in a way that violates the proper meaning of that term, WPW Acquisition Co v City of Troy, 466 Mich 117; 643 NW2d 564 (2002).<BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> Sec. 34d, as amended by Act 6 of 1981, was amended by Act 41 of 1981 to read as follows:“Sec. 34d. (1) As used in this section or section 31 of article 9 of the state constitution of 1963, or both:“(a) “Additions” means all increases in value caused by new construction in the classification, a physical addition of equipment or furnishings in the classification, and the value of property which was exempt from taxes or not included on the assessment unit's previous year's assessment roll for the classification, and, for property in a classification which was classified as part of a different class in the previous year, the value assigned to that property in the previous year.“(b) “Financial officer” means the officer responsible for preparing the budget of a unit of local government. “(c) “Losses” means a decrease in value caused by the removal or destruction of property in the classification, and the value of property taxed in the prior year which has been exempted or removed from the assessment unit's assessment roll for the classification, and the value of property which has been reclassified out of the class of property.“(d) “New construction and improvements” means additions less losses.“(e) “Current year” means the year for which the tax limitation is being calculated.“(2) On or before the first Monday in May of each year the assessing officer of each township or city shall tabulate the assessed valuation as approved by the local board of review for each classification of property which is separately equalized for each unit of local government and provide the tabulated assessed valuations to the county equalization director. The tabulation by the assessing officer shall contain additions and losses for each classification of property which is separately equalized for each unit of local government or part of a unit of local government in the township or city. The county equalization director shall compute these amounts and the current and prior year's state equalized valuation for each classification of property which is separately equalized for each unit of local government that levies taxes under this act within the boundary of the county and shall cooperate with equalization directors of neighboring counties, as necessary, to make the computation for units of local government located in more than 1 county. The county equalization director shall calculate the tax reduction fractions for each unit of local government in the county for the current year. The financial officer for each taxing jurisdiction shall calculate the compounded tax reduction fractions beginning in 1982 resulting from the multiplication of successive tax reduction fractions and shall recognize a local voter action which may increase the compounded tax reduction fractions to a maximum of 1 as the new beginning fractions. Upon request of the superintendent of the intermediate school district, the county equalization director shall transmit the complete computations of the assessed valuations to the superintendent of the intermediate school district within that county. At the request of the presidents of community colleges, the county equalization director shall transmit the complete computations of the assessed valuation to the presidents of community colleges within the county.“(3) On or before the fourth Tuesday in May of each year the county equalization director shall deliver the statement of the computations signed by the county equalization director to the county treasurer.“(4) On or before June 1 of each year the treasurer of each county shall certify the prior year's state equalized valuation of property, the current year's state equalized valuation of property, the amount of additions and losses for the current year, and the current year's tax reduction fractions for each classification of property which is separately equalized for each unit of local government which levies a property tax in the county.“(5) The financial officer of each unit of local government shall make the computation of the tax collection using the data certified by the county treasurer and the state tax commission. At the annual session in October, the county board of commissioners shall not authorize the levy of a tax unless the governing body of the taxing jurisdiction has certified that the requested levy's collection has been reduced, if necessary, in compliance with section 31 of article 9 of the state constitution of 1963 and has attached a completed tax reduction calculation form prescribed by the state tax commission.“(6) The amount of taxes permitted to be collected from tax levies after December 31, 1980, is limited as provided in this section pursuant to section 31 of article 9 of the state constitution of 1963. Without voter approval, a unit of local government shall not collect an amount of taxes on each property classification which is separately equalized greater than the amount determined by multiplying the tax levy on each class by a tax reduction fraction for that classification of property as provided in this section.“(7) Beginning in 1981, a tax reduction fraction shall be determined for each year for each classification of property which is separately equalized for each local unit of government. For ad valorem property taxes levied after December 31, 1980, the numerator of the fractions shall be the product of the difference of total state equalized valuation of the class of property for the preceding year less losses, multiplied by 1.06 and the denominator of the fraction shall be the total state equalized valuation of the class of property for the current year minus additions. The annual tax reduction fractions for ad valorem property tax levies shall not exceed 1. For 1981 ad valorem property tax levies, the 1981 annual tax reduction fractions shall be multiplied by the ad valorem property tax levy for operating purposes from the respective property classification by the unit of local government for 1981, except as provided by subsection (9). “(8) The tax reduction fractions for the 1981 tax year shall be the first fractions in the series of annual reduction fractions which shall be multiplied together to produce the compounded tax reduction fractions for the year. The compounded tax reduction fractions for 1982 shall be calculated by multiplying the 1981 tax reduction fractions for a class by the 1982 tax reduction fraction for the class. The compounded tax reduction fraction for 1983 and each year thereafter for a class shall be calculated by multiplying the local unit's previous year's compounded tax reduction fraction for the class by the current year's tax reduction fraction for the class. Beginning with 1982 ad valorem property tax levies, the compounded tax reduction fractions for the year shall be multiplied by the ad valorem property tax levy for operating purposes from the respective property classification by the unit of local government for the year, except as provided by subsection (9). A compounded tax reduction fraction shall not exceed 1. “(9) After January 1, 1981 and upon voter approval of the increased number of mills as required by subsection (11), the tax reduction shall be determined separately for taxes levied from a number of mills in excess of the number of mills levied in 1980. An increase in the number of mills over the number of mills levied in the previous year that is approved by the voters after January 1, 1981 shall not be subject to a tax reduction until the year following the first levy of these mills which shall be calculated beginning with the tax reduction fractions for the year following the first levy of these mills. The annual tax reduction fractions used in calculating the limitation on taxes from these increased number of mills approved by the voters after January 1, 1981 shall not exceed 1. “(10) A unit of local government may submit to the voters for their approval a ballot question to allow the collection of taxes in excess of the limit set by this section or to reimpose the limit set by this section that had previously been increased or waived. The ballot question to allow the collection of taxes in excess of the limit set by this section may ask the voters to increase the 6% limit on increased tax collections in each class to a higher specified percentage in 1 or more specified years, to waive the application of the annual tax reduction fractions in that year by utilizing annual tax reduction fractions of 1 in determining the compound tax reduction fractions for the year, or to approve the collection in 1 or more specified years of its tax levy without regard to the tax reduction required by section 31 of article 9 of the state constitution of 1963 by approving an increase in that year's compounded tax reduction fractions to 1. If a collection of a tax levy with a limitation of over 6% or without regard to the tax reduction required by subsection (6) and section 31 of article 9 of the state constitution of 1963 is approved for more than 1 year, the voters in the unit of local government may require not more than 1 time in each 12-month period, upon filing a petition signed by not less than 10% of the qualified electors in the unit of local government which signatures have been collected within not more than 90 days after the petition was first circulated, that the question of reinstitution of the 6% limit be submitted to the electors of the unit of local government at either the next regularly scheduled election of the unit of local government or a special election called by the governing board of the unit of local government if the next regularly scheduled election is more than 180 days after the date the petitions are submitted. If, at an election held before the date certification is required of the unit of local government under section 36, the electors approve a question submitted pursuant to this subsection either by the unit of local government or by referendum, the approval shall be effective with ad valorem property tax levies for the year the question was approved. If necessary, any consequential adjustment required of the annual and compound tax reduction fractions and of the summer or winter tax levies of any unit of local government in the year the election is held shall be made by adding or deducting the appropriate amounts to or from the next ad valorem property tax levy of the unit of local government. If the question submitted pursuant to this subsection either by the unit of local government or by referendum is approved by the electors at an election held after the date certification is required of the unit of local government under section 36, approval shall be effective with ad valorem property tax levies for the year immediately following the year in which the question was approved. If a limit in excess of 6% is approved before the date certification is required of the unit of local government under section 36, the year's annual tax reduction fractions shall be recalculated for determining the current year's and all following year's compounded tax reduction fractions. Upon reinstitution of the 6% limit after 1 or more years in which taxes were levied without regard to the required reduction, the compound tax reduction fraction calculation shall utilize 1 as the annual tax reduction fraction for each classification of property for each year in which the limitation was not effective. The provisions of this section shall not allow the levy of a millage rate in excess of the maximum rate authorized by law or charter or for the increase or waiver of the 6% limitation for less than all classifications of property. A vote at an election held between January 1, 1981 and July 4, 1981 at which a majority of the qualified electors of a unit of local government voting thereon approved, without approving an increase or establishment of an authorized millage rate, either the levy of a specified number of mills for operating purposes in excess of the limit imposed for 1981 tax levies pursuant to this section as effective January 1, 1981 or the levy of a certain number of mills for operating purposes after application of this section as effective January 1, 1981, shall be considered sufficient to increase the 6% limitation in 1981 to a percentage which would allow the unit of local government to collect full revenues from the levy of these mills in 1981. A vote at an election held between January 1, 1981 and July 4, 1981 at which a majority of the qualified electors of a unit of local government voting thereon approved, pursuant to this section as effective January 1, 1981, either a compound millage reduction fraction of 1 for 1981 tax levies or the levy of its authorized millage without regard to this section as then effective, shall be considered sufficient to waive the 6% limitation in 1981 for ad valorem property tax levies for that unit of local government. “(11) A millage rate shall not be levied in excess of the rate levied in the previous year without approval of a majority of the qualified electors of the unit of local government voting thereon. A unit of local government, which submits a question seeking the approval of a majority of the qualified electors voting thereon for increasing or establishing an authorized millage rate for operating purposes, shall identify in the question the number of mills for operating purposes that the local unit could levy upon approval of the question in excess of the number of mills levied for operating purposes by the local unit in the previous year. If none of the mills authorized to be levied for operating purposes in 1980 have expired, a vote at an election held between January 1, 1981 and July 4, 1981 at which a majority of the qualified electors of a unit of local government voting thereon approved an increase in the maximum authorized millage rate for operating purposes effective in 1980, shall be considered to increase the number of mills which may be levied for operating purposes by the unit of local government over the millage rate levied for operating purposes by the unit of local government in 1980 by the number of mills by which the maximum authorized millage rate for operating purposes in 1980 is increased. A vote at an election held between January 1, 1981 and May 19, 1981 at which a majority of the qualified electors of a unit of local government voting thereon approved the establishment of a maximum authorized millage rate for operating purposes after a certain number of mills authorized to be levied for operating purposes in 1980 have expired, shall be considered to increase the number of mills which may be levied for operating purposes by the unit of local government in 1980 by the difference, if any, between the total number of mills this vote would actually allow to be levied for operating purposes under this section as effective January 1, 1981, based on the actual 1980 compounded millage reduction fraction and a 1981 annual millage reduction fraction of 1.0, less the millage rate for operating purposes levied for operating purposes under this section as effective January 1, 1981, based on the actual 1980 compounded millage reduction fraction and 1981 annual millage reduction fraction of 1.0, less the millage rate for operating purposes levied by the unit of local government in 1980. A vote at an election held between May 20, 1981 and July 4, 1981 at which a majority of the qualified electors of a unit of local government voting thereon approved the establishment of a maximum authorized millage rate for operating purposes after a certain number of mills authorized to be levied for operating purposes in 1980 have expired, shall be considered to increase the number of mills which may be levied for operating purposes by the unit of local government in 1980 by the difference, if any, between subdivision (a) less subdivision (b): “(a) The sum of the difference between the maximum authorized millage rate for operating purposes in 1980 less the number of authorized mills in 1980 for operating purposes which have expired, plus the number of mills for operating purposes voted upon or renewed over the 1981 maximum authorized millage rate for operating purposes before this approval. “(b) The millage rate for operating purposes levied by the unit of local government in 1980.“(12) A reduction or limitation under this section shall be applied only to taxes imposed for operating purposes, as defined by section 7a.“(13) Notwithstanding any charter provision or law to the contrary, a city, village, township, or county that prepares and mails summer tax bills shall delay the preparation and mailing of the 1981 summer tax bills, and a taxing unit shall not levy ad valorem property taxes in 1981, until between July 6, 1981 and a later date determined by the city, village, township, or county that prepares and mails summer tax bills in 1981. In addition, the final date on which the summer taxes are payable without penalty or interest shall be delayed by the same number of days that the mailing of the tax bills is delayed and the date on which a unit of local government must adopt its budget for a local fiscal year commencing in 1981 may be delayed until after May 19, 1981.“(14) If it is determined subsequent to the levy of a tax that an incorrect tax reduction fraction has been applied, the amount of additional tax revenue or the shortage of tax revenue shall be deducted from or added to the next regular tax levy for that unit of local government after the determination of the reduction of tax collections pursuant to this section.“(15) If, as a result of an appeal of county equalization or state equalization, the state equalized valuation of a separately equalized class of property of a unit of local government changes, the tax reduction fractions for the year shall be recalculated.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The township clerk of each township, on or before September 30 of each year, shall make and deliver to the supervisor of the clerk's township and to the county clerk, a certified copy of all statements and certificates on file and of all records of any vote or resolution in the clerk's office authorizing or directing money to be raised in the township by taxation for township, school, highway, drain, and all other purposes, together with a statement of the aggregate amount to be raised. However, if the issuance of bonds or notes or the levy of taxes for school purposes has been approved by the electors before September 30, this subsection does not preclude delivery by the clerk after September 30 of a resolution authorizing additional millage to be levied in the year voted. The clerk shall present the copies to the county board of commissioners at its annual meeting and file the copies in the clerk's office. The county board of commissioners shall not levy in the year voted a tax levy voted on or after September 30. This subsection does not apply if 1 of subsections (2) through (4) applies.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   For an intermediate school district, the district has a population greater than 1,400,000.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   For an intermediate school district with a population of less than 1,400,000, the millage election is held on or before October 15.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a school district, an intermediate school district, or a community or junior college district shall not conduct more than 1 millage election pursuant to subsection (2). If a district's operating revenue is less than the total operating revenue for the previous school year, the district may hold a second school millage election pursuant to subsection (2) on or before December 7.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3), and except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the amount of taxes that are to be levied for any purpose by a taxing unit that holds an election in any year on or before the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November and that are approved by the electors of that taxing unit shall be certified for that calendar year.

If a millage is certified pursuant to subsection (4) for library purposes, if a taxing unit requests by resolution, the county board of commissioners for the county in which the library is located also may reduce or eliminate the millage previously authorized or dedicated for library purposes to be levied by that taxing unit for that year and direct the reduction or removal of the levy to be spread by the local units in the county.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The reasonable and actual expenses incurred by a township, county, or city in assessing and collecting the school district, intermediate school district, or community or junior college district taxes levied and spread pursuant to an election under subsection (2) or (3) that is held after September 30, to the extent these expenses are in addition to the expense of collection and assessing any other taxes at the same time and exceed the amount of any fees imposed for the collection of these taxes, shall be billed to and paid by the school district, intermediate school district, or community or junior college district. </DIV>

<P>Sec. 39a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    If the determination of the county equalized value is delayed as a result of an appeal taken under this act and pending before the tax tribunal, the assessing officer shall levy taxes upon the taxable value of property as determined by the state tax commission sitting as the state board of equalization and apportioned by the county board of commissioners. The payment of taxes levied in this manner, known as the "tentative levy", does not constitute a final and ultimate discharge of the taxpayer's obligation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   After the final determination of equalized value by the tax tribunal, the assessing officer shall determine the difference in tax, if any, between the tentative levy and a levy made upon the taxable value as finally determined by the tax tribunal known as the "final levy".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the final determination shows that additional taxes are due, the county board of commissioners shall spread the additional levy upon the next succeeding annual tax roll and collect them together with the next succeeding annual taxes upon the property. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the tax liability is decreased as a result of the tax tribunal's final determination of taxable value, the taxes collected under the tentative levy in excess of the tax liability under the final levy shall be credited against the taxes upon the property for the next succeeding year, together with a proportionate share of any collection fee applicable to the difference.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Additional taxes collected or credits against tax liability made under this section shall inure to the benefit or detriment of the taxing units in the respective proportions in which they share the proceeds of the final levy.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 40.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Notwithstanding any provisions in the charter of any city or village to the contrary, all taxes become a debt due to the township, city, village, or county from the owner or person otherwise assessed on the tax day provided for in sections 2 and 13. The amounts assessed for state, county, village, or township taxes on any interest in real property shall become a lien on the real property on December 1, on a day provided for by the charter of a city or village, or on the day provided for in section 40a. The lein for those amounts, and for all interest and charges on those amounts, shall continue until paid. Each tax statement and receipt for taxes on real property sent or given by any county, township, city, or village treasurer shall contain a printed, stamped, or written statement setting forth the date of the commencement and ending of the fiscal year of each taxing unit of government during which general taxes included on the tax statement or receipt will defray the costs of governmental services rendered by that local governmental unit. All personal taxes levied or assessed for state, county, village, or township taxes are also a first lien, prior, superior, and paramount, on all personal property of the persons assessed on December 1, on a day provided for by the charter of a city or village, or on the day provided for in section 40a. The lien for those amounts, and for all interest and charges on those amounts, shall continue until paid. The tax liens take precedence over all other claims, encumbrances, and liens on that personal property, whether created by chattel mortgage, title retaining contract, execution, any final process of a court, attachment, replevin, judgment, or otherwise. A transfer of personal property assessed for taxes does not divest or destroy the lien, except where the personal property is actually sold in the regular course of retail trade. The personal property taxes levied or assessed by any city or village are a first lien, prior, superior, and paramount to any other claims, liens, or encumbrances of any kind upon the personal property assessed as provided in this act, any provisions in the charter of cities or villages to the contrary notwithstanding.</DIV>

If the county treasurer and township supervisor determine that the bond of the township treasurer recorded with the township clerk and on file with the township supervisor is adequate and sufficient to safeguard the proper accounting of state, county, and school taxes as required by law, the township treasurer shall not be required to file with the county treasurer the bond provided for in this section. The county treasurer shall deliver to the supervisor on or before the day the taxes to be collected become a lien a signed statement of approval of the bond. Upon the receipt of the signed statement and on or before the day the taxes to be collected become a lien, the supervisor shall deliver to the township treasurer the tax roll of this township.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A final adjustment and delivery of the total amount of tax collections on hand for the county, community college districts, intermediate school districts, school districts, and public transportation authorities shall be made not later than April 1 of each year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Instead of following the schedule prescribed in subsection (3), the township or city serving as the tax collecting unit and the local governmental unit for which the tax collections are made may enter into an agreement to establish an alternative schedule for delivering tax collections.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A township that has a state equalized valuation of $15,000,000.00 or less shall account for and deliver to the county treasurer, the school district treasurers, and the public transportation authorities and, if the intermediate school district and community college district provide for direct payment pursuant to subsection (9), the intermediate school district treasurers and community college treasurers the taxes collected up to and including January 10, within 10 business days after January 10. However, a township treasurer subject to this subsection shall at no time have on hand collections of state, county, community college, intermediate school district if applicable pursuant to subsection (9), school district, and public transportation authority taxes in excess of 25% of the amount of the taxes apportioned to the township and, when collections on hand reach this percentage, the township treasurer shall immediately account for and turn over the total amount of state and county tax collections on hand to the county treasurer, the total respective amounts of school tax collections on hand to the respective treasurers, and the total respective amounts of public transportation authority tax collections on hand to the respective public transportation authorities. The township treasurer shall notify the secretary or superintendent of each community college district, intermediate school district, and school district applicable and each of the applicable public transportation authorities of the total amount of taxes paid to the respective treasurer or authority, which notification shall show the different funds for which the taxes were collected.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Except as may be provided under section 1613 of Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1976, being section 380.1613 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, when a county treasurer is collecting the school district or intermediate school district levy, the county treasurer shall account for and deliver to the appropriate local governmental unit treasurer the tax collections received by the county treasurer within 10 business days after the county treasurer receives the funds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The county treasurer shall account for and deposit in the county library fund for the use of the county library board, county tax collections received pursuant to a tax levied under section 1 of Act No. 138 of the Public Acts of 1917, being section 397.301 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, within 10 business days after the county treasurer receives the funds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The county treasurer shall account for and deliver to the boards of each metropolitan transportation authority the county tax collections for transportation authority purposes received by the county treasurer within 10 business days after the county treasurer receives the funds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   For taxes that become a lien in December 1984 or after 1984, an intermediate school district board or the board of trustees of a community college may provide that a local tax collecting treasurer shall account for and deliver tax collections directly to the respective intermediate school district or community college treasurer pursuant to the schedule contained in subsections (3), (4), and (5) for delivery of the respective taxes to the county treasurer. A resolution shall be adopted at least 60 days before the day taxes to be collected become a lien and shall specify the period for which the resolution is effective. Copies of the resolution shall be transmitted to each local tax collecting treasurer and county treasurer within the intermediate school district or community college district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   By the fifteenth day of each month, the county treasurer shall account for and deliver to the state the collections under the state education tax act, Act No. 331 of the Public Acts of 1993, being sections 211.901 to 211.906 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, on hand on the last day of the preceding month. By the first day of each month, the county treasurer shall account for and deliver to the state the collections under the state education tax act, Act No. 331 of the Public Acts of 1993, on hand on or before the fifteenth day of the immediately preceding month. The county treasurer may retain the interest earned on the money collected under Act No. 331 of the Public Acts of 1993 while held by the county treasurer, as reimbursement for the cost incurred by the county in collecting and transmitting the tax imposed by that act. The money retained by the county treasurer under this section shall be deposited in the treasury of the county in which the tax is collected to the credit of the general fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   A treasurer who willfully neglects or refuses to perform a duty required by subsections (3) to (8) is subject to the penalty prescribed in section 119(1). </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   Except as otherwise provided by subsection (10), interest earned by a city, township, or county on collections of taxes levied on or after November 5, 1985 before the tax collections are accounted for and delivered to the respective taxing units pursuant to this section shall also be accounted for and delivered to the respective taxing units on a pro rata basis. Interest earned by a city, township, or county on collections of taxes levied before November 5, 1985 before those collections were accounted for and delivered to the respective taxing units in compliance with the requirements of this section is not subject to claim and retroactive collection by those taxing units. However, interest earned on collections of taxes levied on or after November 5, 1985 and before December 1, 1987 are not subject to claim and retroactive collection unless a claim has been filed in a court of competent jurisdiction before March 1, 1988. This subsection does not apply to interest or penalties imposed by law or charter and does not nullify or prohibit any agreements made between a collecting unit and a taxing unit regarding the earned interest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   If there is an agreement for an alternative schedule for delivering tax collections or for interest earned under subsections (4) and (12), the collection of the state education tax is subject to those provisions of that agreement.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Upon receipt of the tax roll, the township treasurer or other collector shall proceed to collect the taxes. The township treasurer or other collector shall mail to each taxpayer at the taxpayer's last known address on the tax roll or to the taxpayer's designated agent a statement showing the description of the property against which the tax is levied, the taxable value of the property, the amount of the tax on the property, and, for property returned to the county treasurer for delinquent taxes, in the year in which the property is returned to the county treasurer for delinquent taxes only, notice of the fact that as of March 1 there were delinquent taxes on the property, that those delinquent taxes were returned to the county treasurer for collection, and contact information for the county treasurer. However, if not later than 2 weeks before the tax bill is finalized, a local tax collecting unit receives from the county notice that previously delinquent taxes on a parcel of property are no longer delinquent, the statement for that property under this subsection is not required to include notice of the fact that as of March 1 there were delinquent taxes on the property, that those delinquent taxes were returned to the county treasurer for collection, and contact information for the county treasurer. If a tax statement is mailed to the taxpayer, a tax statement sent to a taxpayer's designated agent may be in a summary form or may be in an electronic data processing format. If the tax statement information is provided to both a taxpayer and the taxpayer's designated agent, the tax statement mailed to the taxpayer may be identified as an informational copy. A township treasurer or other collector electing to send a tax statement to a taxpayer's designated agent or electing not to include an itemization in the manner described in subsection (10)(d) in a tax statement mailed to the taxpayer shall, upon request, mail a detailed copy of the tax statement, including an itemization of the amount of tax in the manner described by subsection (10)(d), to the taxpayer without charge.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The expense of preparing and mailing the statement shall be paid from the county, township, city, or village funds. Failure to send or receive the notice does not prejudice the right to collect or enforce the payment of the tax. The township treasurer or his or her designee shall remain in the office of the township treasurer at some convenient place in the township from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. to receive taxes on the following days:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) At least 1 business day between December 25 and December 31 unless the township has an arrangement with a local financial institution to receive taxes on behalf of the township treasurer and to forward that payment to the township on the next business day. The township shall provide timely notification of which financial institutions will receive taxes for the township and which days the treasurer or his or her designee will be in the office to receive taxes. As used in this subsection, "designee" means a deputy treasurer or other individual acting on behalf of the township treasurer in compliance with section 43(2) who serves the township as an employee or elected official and is approved by the township board to serve as the designee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The last day that taxes are due and payable before being returned as delinquent under section 78a(2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For the collection of a summer tax levy, the last day taxes are due and payable before interest is added under section 44a(6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as provided by subsection (7), on a sum voluntarily paid before February 15 of the succeeding year, the local property tax collecting unit shall add a property tax administration fee of not more than 1% of the total tax bill per parcel. However, unless otherwise provided for by an agreement between the assessing unit and the collecting unit, if a local property tax collecting unit other than a village does not also serve as the local assessing unit, the excess of the amount of property tax administration fees over the expense to the local property tax collecting unit in collecting the taxes, but not less than 80% of the fee imposed, shall be returned to the local assessing unit. A property tax administration fee is defined as a fee to offset costs incurred by a collecting unit in assessing property values, in collecting the property tax levies, and in the review and appeal processes. The costs of any appeals, in excess of funds available from the property tax administration fee, may be shared by any taxing unit only if approved by the governing body of the taxing unit. Except as provided by subsection (7), on all taxes paid after February 14 and before taxes are returned as delinquent under section 78a(2) the governing body of a city or township may authorize the treasurer to add to the tax a property tax administration fee to the extent imposed on taxes paid before February 15 and the day that taxes are returned as delinquent under section 78a(2) a late penalty charge equal to 3% of the tax. The governing body of a city or township may waive interest from February 15 to the last day of February on a summer property tax that has been deferred under section 51 or any late penalty charge for the homestead property of a senior citizen, paraplegic, quadriplegic, hemiplegic, eligible serviceperson, eligible veteran, eligible widow or widower, totally and permanently disabled person, or blind person, as those persons are defined in chapter 9 of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.501 to 206.532, if the person makes a claim before February 15 for a credit for that property provided by chapter 9 of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.501 to 206.532, if the person presents a copy of the form filed for that credit to the local treasurer, and if the person has not received the credit before February 15. The governing body of a city or township may waive interest from February 15 to the day taxes are returned as delinquent under section 78a(2) on a summer property tax deferred under section 51 or any late penalty charge for a person's property that is subject to a farmland development rights agreement recorded with the register of deeds of the county in which the property is situated as provided in section 36104 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.36104, if the person presents a copy of the development rights agreement or verification that the property is subject to a development rights agreement before February 15. A 4% county property tax administration fee, a property tax administration fee to the extent imposed on and if authorized under subsection (7) for taxes paid before taxes are returned as delinquent under section 78a(2), and interest on the tax at the rate of 1% per month shall be added to taxes collected by the township or city treasurer after the last day taxes are payable before being returned as delinquent under section 78a(2) and before settlement with the county treasurer, and the payment shall be treated as though collected by the county treasurer. If the statements required to be mailed by this section are not mailed before December 31, the treasurer shall not impose a late penalty charge on taxes collected after February 14.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The governing body of a local property tax collecting unit may waive all or part of the property tax administration fee or the late penalty charge, or both. A property tax administration fee collected by the township treasurer shall be used only for the purposes for which it may be collected as specified by subsection (3) and this subsection. If the bond of the treasurer, as provided in section 43, is furnished by a surety company, the cost of the bond may be paid by the township from the property tax administration fee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If apprehensive of the loss of personal tax assessed upon the roll, the township treasurer may enforce collection of the tax at any time, and if compelled to seize property or bring an action in December may add, if authorized under subsection (7), a property tax administration fee of not more than 1% of the total tax bill per parcel and 3% for a late penalty charge.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Along with taxes returned delinquent to a county treasurer, the amount of the property tax administration fee prescribed by subsection (3) that is imposed and not paid shall be included in the return of delinquent taxes and, when delinquent taxes are distributed by the county treasurer under this act, the delinquent property tax administration fee shall be distributed to the treasurer of the local unit who transmitted the statement of taxes returned as delinquent. Interest imposed upon delinquent property taxes under this act shall also be imposed upon the property tax administration fee and, for purposes of this act other than for the purpose of determining to which local unit the county treasurer shall distribute a delinquent property tax administration fee, any reference to delinquent taxes shall be considered to include the property tax administration fee returned as delinquent for the same property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The local property tax collecting treasurer shall not impose a property tax administration fee, collection fee, or any type of late penalty charge authorized by law or charter unless the governing body of the local property tax collecting unit approves, by resolution or ordinance adopted after December 31, 1982, an authorization for the imposition of a property tax administration fee, collection fee, or any type of late penalty charge provided for by this section or by charter, which authorization is valid for all levies that become a lien after the resolution or ordinance is adopted. However, unless otherwise provided for by an agreement between the assessing unit and the collecting unit, a local property tax collecting unit that does not also serve as the assessing unit shall impose a property tax administration fee on each parcel at a rate equal to the rate of the fee imposed for city or township taxes on that parcel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The annual statement required by 1966 PA 125, MCL 565.161 to 565.164, or a monthly billing form or mortgagor passbook provided instead of that annual statement must include a statement to the effect that a taxpayer who was not mailed the tax statement or a copy of the tax statement by the township treasurer or other collector will receive, upon request and without charge, a copy of the tax statement from the township treasurer or other collector or, if the tax statement has been mailed to the taxpayer's designated agent, from either the taxpayer's designated agent or the township treasurer or other collector. A designated agent who is subject to 1966 PA 125, MCL 565.161 to 565.164, and who has been mailed the tax statement for taxes that became a lien in the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the annual statement may be required to be furnished shall mail, upon request and without charge to a taxpayer who was not mailed that tax statement or a copy of that tax statement, a copy of that tax statement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) For taxes levied after December 31, 2001, if taxes levied on qualified real property remain unpaid on February 15, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The unpaid taxes on that qualified real property shall be collected in the same manner as unpaid taxes levied on personal property are collected under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Unpaid taxes on qualified real property shall not be returned as delinquent to the county treasurer for forfeiture, foreclosure, and sale under sections 78 to 79a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If a county treasurer discovers that unpaid taxes on qualified real property have been returned as delinquent for forfeiture, foreclosure, and sale under sections 78 to 79a, the county treasurer shall return those unpaid taxes to the appropriate local tax collection unit for collection as provided in subdivision (a).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Designated agent" means an individual, partnership, association, corporation, receiver, estate, trust, or other legal entity that has entered into an escrow account agreement or other agreement with the taxpayer that obligates that individual or legal entity to pay the property taxes for the taxpayer or, if an agreement has not been entered into, that was designated by the taxpayer on a form made available to the taxpayer by the township treasurer and filed with that treasurer. The designation by the taxpayer remains in effect until revoked by the taxpayer in a writing filed with the township treasurer. The form made available by the township treasurer must include a statement that submission of the form allows the treasurer to mail the tax statement to the designated agent instead of to the taxpayer and a statement notifying the taxpayer of his or her right to revoke the designation by a writing filed with the township treasurer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Qualified real property" means buildings and improvements located upon leased real property that are assessed as real property under section 2(1)(c), except buildings and improvements exempt under section 9f, if the value of the buildings or improvements is not otherwise included in the assessment of the real property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Taxpayer" means the owner of the property on which the tax is imposed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) When describing in subsection (1) that the amount of tax on the property must be shown in the tax statement, "amount of tax" means an itemization by dollar amount of each of the several ad valorem property taxes and special assessments that a person may pay under section 53 and an itemization by millage rate, on either the tax statement or a separate form accompanying the tax statement, of each of the several ad valorem property taxes that a person may pay under section 53. The township treasurer or other collector may replace the itemization described in this subdivision with a statement informing the taxpayer that the itemization of the dollar amount and millage rate of the taxes is available without charge from the local property tax collecting unit.</div>

State Treasurer v Wilson; 423 Mich 138; 347 NW2d 770 (1985).The collection fee imposed by the General Property Tax Act upon property taxes voluntarily paid before February 15 of the year following the issuance of a tax bill does not, on its face, create separate classifications that invoke an equal protection challenge under the Michigan Constitution. Rouge Parkway Associates v Wayne, 423 Mich 411; 364 NW2d 849 (1985).<BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> Section 2 of Act 503 of 1982 provides: “The designation, by this amendatory act, of collection fees as property tax administration fees is intended to clarify the legislative intent and cure any misinterpretation surrounding the fact that a “collection fee” is imposed to cover all costs necessary and incident to the collection of property taxes, including the costs of assessing property values and in the review and appeal processes.”<BR><B>Popular Name:</B> Act 206</p>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Notwithstanding any other statutory or charter provision to the contrary, beginning in 2005 and each year after 2005, a county shall impose as a summer property tax levy that portion of the number of mills allocated to the county by a county tax allocation board or authorized for the county through a separate tax limitation vote as provided in this section. The portion of the total number of mills allocated to a county by a county tax allocation board or authorized for a county through a separate tax limitation vote that shall be imposed in each year as a summer property tax levy under this section is as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) In 2005, 1/3 of the total number of mills allocated to the county by a county tax allocation board or authorized for the county through a separate tax limitation vote.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) In 2006, 2/3 of the total number of mills allocated to the county by a county tax allocation board or authorized for the county through a separate tax limitation vote.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) In 2007 and each year after 2007, the total number of mills allocated to the county by a county tax allocation board or authorized for the county through a separate tax limitation vote.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Notwithstanding any other statutory or charter provision to the contrary, beginning in 2013 and each year after 2013, a millage that is levied by any taxing authority within a local tax collecting unit that had been previously billed and collected as part of the winter property tax levy in a preceding tax year may be accelerated and collected earlier in that tax year as a summer property tax levy if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The aggregate amount of the revenue from the levy and collection of all individual millages that would be levied and collected in the winter tax bill totals $100.00 or less per individual tax bill, excluding any property tax administration fee. A millage may be accelerated and collected earlier for only those tax bills that total $100.00 or less for all individual millages and that millage may be levied and collected as a winter property tax levy for all other tax bills that total more than $100.00 for all individual millages. Any additional millage approved to be levied by any taxing authority after collection of the summer property tax levy shall be collected as part of a winter property tax levy as provided in this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A resolution authorizing the summer collection is approved by all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The county board of commissioners.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The legislative body of the local tax collecting unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The county tax allocation board, if any.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Within 60 days of approval of the resolutions required under subdivision (b), the local tax collecting unit notifies all owners of property on the tax roll that if the aggregate amount of the revenue from the levy and collection of all individual millages that would be levied and collected in the winter tax bill totals $100.00 or less, excluding any property tax administration fee, those millages will be accelerated and collected as a summer property tax levy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Before June 30 and in conformance with the procedures prescribed by this act, the taxes being collected as a summer property tax levy shall be spread in terms of millages on the assessment roll, the amount of tax levied shall be assessed in proportion to the taxable value, and a tax roll shall be prepared that commands the appropriate treasurer to collect on July 1 the taxes indicated as due on the tax roll.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Taxes authorized to be collected shall become a lien against the property on which assessed, and due from the owner of that property on July 1.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) All taxes and interest imposed pursuant to this section that are unpaid before March 1 shall be returned as delinquent on March 1 and collected pursuant to this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Interest shall be added to taxes collected after September 14 at that rate imposed by section 78a on delinquent property tax levies that became a lien in the same year. However, if September 14 is on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the last day taxes are due and payable before interest is added is on the next business day and interest shall be added to taxes that remain unpaid on the immediately succeeding business day. The tax levied under this act that is collected with the city taxes shall be subject to the same penalties, interest, and collection charges as city taxes and shall be returned as delinquent to the county treasurer in the same manner and with the same interest, penalties, and fees as city taxes. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) All or a portion of the fees or charges, or both, authorized under section 44 may be imposed on taxes paid before March 1 and shall be retained by the treasurer actually performing the collection of the summer property tax levy pursuant to this section, regardless of whether all or part of these fees or charges, or both, have been waived by the township or city.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Collections shall be remitted to the county for which the taxes were collected pursuant to section 43.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) To the extent applicable and consistent with the requirements of this section, this act shall apply to proceedings in relation to the assessment, spreading, and collection of taxes pursuant to this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Each county shall establish a restricted fund known as the revenue sharing reserve fund. The total amount required to be placed in the revenue sharing reserve fund for each county shall equal the amount of that county's December 2004 property tax levy of the total number of mills allocated to the county by a county tax allocation board or authorized for the county through a separate tax limitation vote, less any amount of tax levy captured and used under a tax increment financing plan under 1975 PA 197, MCL 125.1651 to 125.1681; the tax increment finance authority act, 1980 PA 450, MCL 125.1801 to 125.1830; the local development financing act, 1986 PA 281, MCL 125.2151 to 125.2174; or the brownfield redevelopment financing act, 1996 PA 381, MCL 125.2651 to 125.2672, and shall be deposited in the revenue sharing reserve fund as provided in this section. Revenues credited to the revenue sharing reserve fund from the December tax levy of a county with a fiscal year ending December 31 shall be accrued to the fiscal year ending in the year of that December property tax levy. Revenue shall be credited to the fund by each county as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) From the county's December 2004 property tax levy, 1/3 of the total December levy of the total number of mills allocated to the county by a county tax allocation board or authorized for the county through a separate tax limitation vote, less any amount of tax levy captured and used under a tax increment financing plan under 1975 PA 197, MCL 125.1651 to 125.1681; the tax increment finance authority act, 1980 PA 450, MCL 125.1801 to 125.1830; the local development financing act, 1986 PA 281, MCL 125.2151 to 125.2174; or the brownfield redevelopment financing act, 1996 PA 381, MCL 125.2651 to 125.2672.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) From the county's December 2005 property tax levy, 1/2 of the remaining balance required to be deposited in the fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) From the county's December 2006 property tax levy, the balance required to be deposited in the fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) All of the following apply to a revenue sharing reserve fund established under subsection (10):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Funds in the revenue sharing reserve fund may not be expended in any fiscal year except as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Funds in the revenue sharing reserve fund may be used within a county fiscal year for cash flow purposes at the discretion of the county.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Interest earnings on funds deposited in the revenue sharing reserve fund shall be credited to the revenue sharing reserve fund. However, the county is not required to reimburse the revenue sharing reserve fund for a reduction of interest earnings that occurs because funds in the revenue sharing reserve fund were used for cash flow purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The revenue sharing reserve fund shall be separately reported in the annual financial report required under section 4 of 1919 PA 71, MCL 21.44.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) For a county fiscal year that ends on December 31, 2004, a county may expend in that fiscal year an amount not to exceed the payments made to that county under the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921, in October and December 2003 and, if the payment is accrued back to the county's 2003 fiscal year, February 2004.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Not later than March 1, 2005, a county that receives a payment in October 2004 as provided in a bill making appropriations to the department of treasury for the 2004-05 fiscal year shall pay the amount of that payment to the state treasurer from the revenue sharing reserve fund. A county that does not make the payment required under this subsection shall not make any expenditures from the fund provided under subsection (13).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) For each fiscal year of a county that begins after September 30, 2004, a county may expend from the revenue sharing reserve fund an amount not to exceed the total payments made to that county under the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921, in the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, adjusted annually by the inflation rate, without regard to any executive orders issued after May 17, 2004. As used in this subsection, "inflation rate" means that term as defined in section 34d.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) A county’s required 2012 revenue sharing reserve fund balance shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of county allocated property tax the county had to refund for the 2004 tax year due to a single court judgment, if the refund of 2004 county allocated tax due to that judgment was at least 70% of the county’s 2011 allowable withdrawal from its revenue sharing reserve fund. The refund amount shall include the interest the county paid on the 2004 property tax refund. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) If a resolution authorizing a summer property tax levy for a tax previously billed as part of the winter property tax levy is approved under subsection (2), the treasurer that collects the summer property tax levy shall establish a restricted fund to be known as the other levies reserve fund for any millage collected that was previously billed as part of the winter property tax levy. Any millage that had been previously billed and collected as part of the winter property tax levy in a preceding tax year that is accelerated and collected earlier as a summer property tax levy shall be deposited into the other levies reserve fund. The treasurer that collects the summer property tax levy shall distribute to the local taxing authorities the revenues credited to the other levies reserve fund from the summer property tax collection of a millage that had been previously billed and collected as part of a winter property tax levy on December 1 of the tax year that the December property tax levy would otherwise have been due and payable. If a millage previously billed and collected as part of the winter property tax levy is accelerated and collected earlier as a summer property tax levy, and if the millage collected in that summer property tax levy is less than that millage would have been if levied as part of the immediately succeeding winter property tax levy, the treasurer that collected the summer property tax levy may issue a supplemental winter tax bill for the deficiency or, if approved by a resolution of the legislative body of the local unit that collected the summer property tax levy, pay any deficiency from that local unit's general fund. The treasurer collecting the summer property tax levy shall account for interest earned on the other levies reserve fund and interest shall be transmitted to the various local tax collecting units in proportion to the revenue collected from a millage previously billed and collected as part of the winter property tax levy in a preceding tax year that is accelerated and collected earlier as a summer property tax levy, after a deduction of reasonable expenses incurred by the treasurer in administering the accounting and disbursement of funds, to the extent that those expenses are in addition to the expenses of accounting and disbursing other taxes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) The treasurer that collects the state education tax shall collect the summer property tax levy under this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a person neglects or refuses to pay a tax on property assessed to that person, the township or city treasurer, as appropriate, shall, or for the state education tax levied under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, the state treasurer may also, subject to subsection (4), collect the tax by seizing the personal property of that person, in an amount sufficient to pay the tax, the fees, and the charges, for subsequent sale of the property, and no property is exempt. The treasurer may sell the property seized, in an amount sufficient to pay the taxes and all charges, at public auction in the place where seized or in the township or city of which he or she is treasurer or for the state treasurer, anywhere in the state. The treasurer shall give public notice of the auction at least 5 days before the sale by posting written or printed notices in 3 public places in the township, village, or city where the sale is to be made. The sale may be adjourned from time to time if the treasurer considers it necessary. If the property is seized and advertised, the sale may take place at any time within 6 days after the expiration of the warrant of sale. If it is necessary to sell personal property that brings more than the amount of taxes and charges, the balance shall be returned to the person from whose possession the property was taken. However, if the state seizes and sells property and the sale brings more than the amount of the state education tax and charges due, the state shall distribute the balance on a pro rata basis to any other local taxing units to which delinquent personal property taxes on that property remain unpaid. If property seized under this section cannot be sold for want of bidders, and in that case only, the treasurer shall return a statement of that fact and the tax shall be returned as unpaid. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Notwithstanding or in lieu of subsection (1), and subject to subsection (4), the township or city treasurer, in the name of the township, village, or city, or the state treasurer, in the name of the state, may sue the person to whom the tax is assessed and garnishee any debtor or debtors of that person. The tax roll is prima facie evidence of the debt sought to be recovered. If the person to whom the tax is assessed did not own the property on the tax day for the year in which the unpaid tax was levied, the township or city treasurer, in the name of the township, village, or city, or the state treasurer, in the name of the state, may sue any person that did own the property on the tax day for the year in which the unpaid tax was levied and garnishee any debtor or debtors of that person.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a person that possesses the personal property of another person is assessed for that property and pays the taxes on the property, the person paying the taxes may recover in a civil action from the person for whose benefit the taxes were paid the money paid with the applicable interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Notwithstanding any other provision in this act or charter to the contrary, a person is not subject to personal liability for any unpaid property tax levied on real property unless that person owned the real property on the tax day for the year in which the unpaid tax was levied. A person contesting personal liability under this subsection may raise the issue in an enforcement action in the trial court regardless of whether the person previously raised the issue with the local board of review. As used in this subsection, "trial court" means any district court, probate court, municipal court, small claims court, appellate court, or other tribunal in which the issue of personal liability is litigated.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A person may pay the taxes or special assessments, any 1 of the several taxes or special assessments, a portion of the taxes or special assessments that is specified by the charter of a local collecting unit or by an ordinance or resolution adopted by the governing body of the local collecting unit, or if a specification is not made by an ordinance, resolution, or the charter of a local collecting unit a portion of the taxes or special assessments that is approved by the treasurer of the local collecting unit, on any parcel or description of land, or on any undivided share thereof, and the treasurer shall cause to be noted across the face of the receipt in an indelible manner any portion of the taxes or special assessments remaining unpaid. When payment of the taxes or special assessments on any parcel or description of land, or on any undivided share thereof, is made to any local collecting treasurer, the treasurer shall place or cause to be placed upon the face of the receipt the following certificate: "I hereby certify that application was made to pay all taxes and special assessments due and payable at this office on the description shown in this receipt except................................................................................... </div>

The application to pay the taxes or special assessments on any part of any parcel or description of land shall be accompanied by a statement from the assessing officer of the township or city in which the lands are situated showing the valuation of the part and of the several parts of the parcel or description of land, and the assessing officer shall make the valuations and furnish a statement at the request of any person who presents to the assessing officer a correct description and division of the parcel or description of land to be divided. The person making the payment shall accurately describe the part or share on which he or she makes payment, and the receipt given, and the record of the receiving officer shall show the description, and by whom paid; and in case of the sale of the remaining part or share for nonpayment of taxes or special assessments, he or she may purchase the same in like manner as any disinterested person could.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If an assessing officer has reason to believe that a violation of the land division act, 1967 PA 288, MCL 560.101 to 560.293, has occurred with respect to property for which a division is being requested pursuant to subsection (2) or section 24, or that such a division does not conform with the requirements of the land division act, 1967 PA 288, MCL 560.101 to 560.293, the assessing officer shall not recognize a division of that property requested pursuant to subsection (2) or section 24 on the tax roll or assessment roll until he or she refers the suspected violation or potential nonconformity to the county prosecuting attorney and gives written notice to the plat section of the department of commerce, the person requesting the division, and the person suspected of the violation or potential nonconformity, of such referral to the prosecuting attorney.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A person having a lien on property may, after 30 days from the time the tax is payable, pay the taxes thereon, and the same may be added to his or her lien and recovered with the rate of interest borne by the lien. A tenant of real estate may pay the taxes thereon and deduct the taxes from his or her rent, unless there is an agreement to the contrary. Such payment may be made to the local collecting treasurer while the tax roll is in his or her hands, or afterwards to the county treasurer. The receipt given shall be evidence of payment. Every such receipt shall be considered to include the certificate prescribed by subsection (1), and unless otherwise noted thereon, shall be construed as an application to pay all taxes and special assessments assessed against the property described therein and then due and payable at the office of the treasurer issuing the receipt.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A person owning either mineral rights not otherwise exempt under this act or surface rights in property, but not both, which rights are authorized under this act to be separately assessed, may pay on the rights owned as authorized in this section for the payment upon an undivided share in the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a part of any parcel of real property is acquired for highway purposes, it shall be separately assessed and the assessing officer shall make the allocation of the taxes or special assessments between the part so acquired and the remainder as may be considered by the assessing officer to be in conformity with standard assessment practices. Upon the payment of the taxes or assessments attributable thereto, the part or parcel of real property so acquired shall be removed from the tax rolls. The acceptance by the city, village, township, or county treasurer of the payment shall not affect, prejudice, or destroy any tax lien on the remainder of the parcel of real property from which the part is taken. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For purposes of determining the taxes which are required to be paid, payment made by means of a property tax credit which is authorized to be transferred under the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.1 to 206.713, shall be excluded.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The acceptance of payment of less than the total of the taxes or special assessments due shall not serve to waive interest imposed pursuant to law or charter on taxes or special assessments that are not paid by dates set, pursuant to subsection (1), by law or charter.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    For taxes levied after December 31, 1991 and before January 1, 1998, the assessment roll for each tax year shall be corrected to reflect that improvements to real property assessed on that tax roll as partially completed new construction and the land on which the improvements are located are exempt from the collection of taxes under this act if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The improvements and the land on which the improvements are located are determined to be exempt from taxes collected under this act on tax day in the year construction of the improvements was completed and the property was put to use.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The property owner claimed before January 1, 1998, that the partially completed new construction and the land on which the improvements are located was exempt from the collection of taxes under this act in a formal protest to the assessor as provided under a local ordinance or charter or in a protest to the first board of review that met pursuant to section 30 after a certificate of occupancy for the completed new construction was issued and that board of review denied the property owner's protest, and the property owner subsequently filed an appeal with the Michigan tax tribunal and that appeal was denied.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For taxes levied after December 31, 1997, the assessment roll for each tax year shall be corrected to reflect that improvements to real property assessed on that tax roll as partially completed new construction and the land on which the improvements are located are exempt from the collection of taxes under this act if the improvements and the land on which the improvements are located are determined to be exempt from taxes collected under this act on tax day in the year construction of the improvements was completed and the property was put to use. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   For each tax year in which the tax roll is corrected under subsection (1) or (2), a corrected tax bill shall be issued by the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of the tax roll or by the county treasurer if the county has possession of the tax roll. If granting the exemption under this section results in an overpayment of the tax, a rebate, including any interest and penalties paid, shall be made to the taxpayer by the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of the tax roll or by the county treasurer if the county has possession of the tax roll within 30 days of the date the exemption is granted.

</P>
<P>Sec. 55.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A township treasurer or other collecting officer who is unable to collect any of the taxes on the roll, assessed on real or personal property, shall make a duplicate statement of the same with a full and perfect description of the property, as entered on the tax roll, with the taxes assessed upon each parcel as shown on the roll and the name of the person to whom the property is assessed. A township treasurer or other collecting officer may include as a delinquent tax any unpaid special assessment which is delinquent on the last day of February in the delinquent taxes returned to the county treasurer the next day pursuant to this section. A delinquent special assessment included as a delinquent tax pursuant to this section shall, after return to the county treasurer, be a valid tax for all purposes under this act. In lieu of this delinquent tax roll, the original tax roll may be used as a delinquent roll, if the use is approved by a resolution adopted by the county board of commissioners. If the original tax roll is used as a delinquent roll the amount of the taxes which remain unpaid on a piece of property at time of settlement with the county treasurer shall be extended in total to a column provided in the tax roll for this purpose. The aggregate total of this delinquent tax column in the tax roll constitutes the total taxes returned delinquent to the county treasurer. The state treasurer may prescribe a tax roll form which meets the requirements of this section or approve or disapprove tax roll forms adopted by the various tax collecting local units.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The collecting officer shall attach his affidavit to the tax roll or delinquent roll stating the aggregate amount of taxes remaining unpaid and the amounts remaining unpaid for each taxing unit and the amount of all moneys collected on account of taxes. The affidavit shall state in substance that the sums mentioned in the statement as uncollected remain unpaid and that the collecting officer has not, upon diligent inquiry, been able to discover any goods or chattels belonging to the person liable to pay the sums upon which he could levy the same.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If the original tax roll is used as a delinquent tax roll the county treasurer, upon receipt of the payment of an item of delinquent tax, shall note the fact of the payment of delinquent tax in the roll using a distinctive stamp or marking which clearly indicates that the tax was paid to the county treasurer, the date of payment and the number of the delinquent tax receipt. The county treasurer shall immediately compare the affidavits of the tax collecting officer with regard to the taxes collected and taxes remaining unpaid with the tax roll. If the county treasurer finds them to be correct, a certificate shall be added to each of them showing that the county treasurer has examined and compared the statements with the tax roll and found them correct, and shall file the original of the statements in his office and forward the duplicate to the township clerk who shall file them in his office. The county treasurer at any time may reject any tax upon land which has been twice assessed, or upon any parcel which is so erroneously or defectively described upon the tax roll that it cannot be correctly and easily ascertained. The township treasurer or other collecting officer upon filing the statement with the county treasurer, or within 5 days thereafter, shall file a duplicate statement with the secretary or director of each school district showing the amount of school taxes collected for the school district and the amount of school taxes remaining unpaid which have been returned delinquent to the county treasurer. The township treasurer or other collecting officer at the time of filing the statement shall also prepare duplicate statements or copies thereof to be signed and approved by the secretary or director of each school district which shall be recorded by the township clerk and filed with the supervisor of the township. The county treasurer shall give to the township treasurer a receipt, stating the amount of moneys paid by the township treasurer, for which the township shall receive a credit on the books of the county treasurer, and shall also give the township treasurer a statement of all taxes rejected, the amount of delinquent taxes returned, and the amount of any unpaid taxes on personal property, which receipt and statements shall be the vouchers of the treasurer of the amounts specified therein.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 56.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The county treasurer shall indorse on the statement given to the township treasurer the fact of the settlement on the bond of the township or city treasurer, which indorsement shall operate as a discharge of the township or city treasurer and his or her sureties from the obligation on the bond, unless the return of the treasurer is incorrect, in which case the bond shall continue in force, and the township or city treasurer and his or her sureties shall be liable on the bond for all damages occasioned by incorrect returns. The township treasurer shall immediately deposit his or her tax roll with the county treasurer, who shall file and preserve the tax roll in his or her office. This tax roll or a certified copy of this tax roll shall, for all purposes and in all courts, actions, and proceedings, be taken, held, and used as evidence, in the same manner and with like effect as the original roll.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The county treasurer shall give the township or city treasurer a statement of all the personal property taxes which remain uncollected, taken from the return of the township or city treasurer, with a warrant authorizing the township or city treasurer, or his or her successor, to collect them pursuant to law, and after receipt of this statement the township or city treasurer, or his or her successor, shall have the same power to collect the personal property taxes as under the original warrant. A township or city shall not be required to advance to the county treasurer or school district treasurer the amount of any unpaid county and school district taxes assessed against personal property, but any sums collected by any township or city treasurer upon county personal property taxes subsequent to the settlement with the county treasurer shall be paid to the county treasurer and any sums collected by any township or city treasurer upon school district personal property taxes subsequent to the settlement with the county treasurer shall be paid to the school district treasurer within 10 days after the collection. The county treasurer and the township or city treasurer shall then credit the remitted personal property tax collections upon the returned tax roll and give receipt for them. The bond, if any, given by the township or city treasurer to the county treasurer covering the collection of county and school taxes shall not be kept in force on account of any unpaid personal property taxes but in case any treasurer should default in the payment to the county treasurer of any collected county personal property taxes or to the school district treasurer of any collected school district personal property taxes, after the termination of the bond, then the township or city of which he or she is treasurer shall be liable for these tax collections.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Notwithstanding subsection (2) and upon an agreement entered into by the governing body of the local property tax collecting unit and the county board of commissioners with the concurrence of the county treasurer, the county treasurer shall be responsible for the collection of the delinquent personal property taxes of the city or township. The agreement shall specify the period during which the county treasurer shall be responsible for the collection of delinquent personal property taxes. However, a county may condition such an agreement upon the county entering into similar agreements with other local property tax collecting units in the county. After the accounting has been made and the other duties required by this section are performed, the county treasurer shall collect delinquent personal property taxes collected by the local property tax collecting unit which has entered into an agreement pursuant to this subsection. Within 120 days after March 1 of each year the county treasurer shall send notices to all known delinquent personal property taxpayers, demanding payment of the delinquent personal property taxes. Failure to send or receive the notice shall not in any way prejudice the right to collect or enforce the payment of the tax. If a delinquent personal property taxpayer neglects or refuses to pay the tax, the county treasurer shall have powers of distraint and sale identical to those given to the township or city treasurer in section 47. The county treasurer may also use whatever remedies there may be at law or equity for the collection of any indebtedness in order to enforce the payment of the tax. The county treasurer shall add to the amount of the assessed tax any collection or administration fee, distraint and sale fee, interest, penalty, or charge provided by this act and shall also collect whatever costs, fees, or expenses allowed by a court in which action was taken. For each county that has agreed to collect delinquent personal property taxes pursuant to this subsection, a county delinquent personal property tax administrative fund is established and all fees, interest, penalties, costs, charges, or expenses the county treasurer collects pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited into this fund. The money in this fund shall be used by the county treasurer to pay the costs of collecting delinquent personal property taxes. To the extent that money in this fund exceeds the cost of collecting delinquent personal property taxes, the county treasurer shall intermittently transfer the excess money to the general fund of the county. The amount of the assessed taxes collected by the county treasurer shall be distributed to the different taxing units in the same manner as the delinquent real property taxes collected by him or her are distributed.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   After the return of lands for unpaid taxes, the county treasurer is authorized to receive, under like provisions as in section 53, the amounts of the several taxes or any of them due, and the board of commissioners in each county may authorize notice to be given to all delinquent taxpayers so far as known. Neither taxes nor special assessments that are delinquent may be paid under protest to the county treasurer.

Except when the final installment of the tax is paid, the county treasurer shall not issue a receipt for a payment of less than $1.00 and any tax or installment then sought to be paid in an amount less than $1.00 shall not be discharged or considered paid unless the sum of $1.00 is paid, and the difference between the amount of the tax paid and $1.00 shall be considered to be a part payment of the cost of issuing the receipts and shall be credited to the general fund of the county. In the case of payments by the same taxpayer as many descriptions shall be included in 1 receipt as will be sufficient to make a payment of $1.00. When payment of the taxes on any parcel or description of land or on any undivided share of land is made to any county treasurer, the treasurer shall place or cause to be placed upon the face of the receipt or redemption certificate, the following certificate: "I hereby certify that application was made to pay all taxes and special assessments due and payable at this office on the description shown in this receipt except for the years and items as follows:</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The legislature finds that there exists in this state a continuing need to strengthen and revitalize the economy of this state and its municipalities by encouraging the efficient and expeditious return to productive use of property returned for delinquent taxes. Therefore, the powers granted in this act relating to the return of property for delinquent taxes constitute the performance by this state or a political subdivision of this state of essential public purposes and functions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) It is the intent of the legislature that the provisions of this act relating to the return, forfeiture, and foreclosure of property for delinquent taxes satisfy the minimum requirements of due process required under the constitution of this state and the constitution of the United States but that those provisions do not create new rights beyond those required under the state constitution of 1963 or the constitution of the United States. The failure of this state or a political subdivision of this state to follow a requirement of this act relating to the return, forfeiture, or foreclosure of property for delinquent taxes shall not be construed to create a claim or cause of action against this state or a political subdivision of this state unless the minimum requirements of due process accorded under the state constitution of 1963 or the constitution of the United States are violated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Not later than December 1, 1999, the county board of commissioners of a county, by a resolution adopted at a meeting held pursuant to the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275, and with the written concurrence of the county treasurer and the county executive, if any, may elect to have this state foreclose property under this act forfeited to the county treasurer under section 78g. At any time during December 2004, the county board of commissioners of a county, by a resolution adopted at a meeting held pursuant to the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275, and with the written concurrence of the county treasurer and county executive, if any, may do either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Elect to have this state foreclose property under this act forfeited to the county treasurer under section 78g.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Rescind its prior resolution by which it elected to have this state foreclose property under this act forfeited to the county treasurer under section 78g.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Beginning January 1, 2009 through March 1, 2009, the county board of commissioners of a county in which is located an eligible city, as that term is defined in section 89d, may, by a resolution adopted at a meeting held pursuant to the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275, and with the written concurrence of the county treasurer and county executive, if any, rescind its prior resolution by which it elected to have this state foreclose property under this act forfeited to the county treasurer under section 78g.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The county board of commissioners of a county that has elected to have property forfeited under section 78g foreclosed by this state under this act may, by a resolution adopted at a meeting held pursuant to the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275, and with the written concurrence of the county treasurer and county executive, if any, rescind its prior resolution by which it elected to have this state foreclose property under this act forfeited to the county treasurer under section 78g. A county board of commissioners shall forward a copy of the resolution and any concurrence to the department of treasury not later than November 30 in the year in which the resolution is adopted. A county that rescinds its prior election under this subsection shall act as the foreclosing governmental unit under this act for all property forfeited to the county treasurer under section 78g after February 1 in the year immediately following the year in which the resolution is adopted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The foreclosure of forfeited property by a county is voluntary and is not an activity or service required of units of local government for purposes of section 29 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A county and a local governmental unit within that county may enter into an agreement for the collection of property taxes or the enforcement and consolidation of tax liens within that local governmental unit. A local governmental unit shall not establish a delinquent tax revolving fund under section 87b.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this section and sections 78a through 155 for purposes of the collection of taxes returned as delinquent:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Foreclosing governmental unit" means 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The treasurer of a county.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) This state if the county has elected under subsection (3) to have this state foreclose property under this act forfeited to the county treasurer under section 78g.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Forfeited" or "forfeiture" means a foreclosing governmental unit may seek a judgment of foreclosure under section 78k if the property is not redeemed as provided under this act, but does not acquire a right to possession or any other interest in the property.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) For taxes levied after December 31, 1998, all property returned for delinquent taxes, and upon which taxes, interest, penalties, and fees remain unpaid after the property is returned as delinquent to the county treasurers of this state under this act, is subject to forfeiture, foreclosure, and sale for the enforcement and collection of the delinquent taxes as provided in section 78, this section, and sections 78b to 79a. As used in section 78, this section, and sections 78b to 79a, "taxes" includes interest, penalties, and fees imposed before the taxes become delinquent and unpaid special assessments or other assessments that are due and payable up to and including the date of the foreclosure hearing under section 78k.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) On March 1 in each year, taxes levied in the immediately preceding year that remain unpaid shall be returned as delinquent for collection. However, if the last day in a year that taxes are due and payable before being returned as delinquent is on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the last day taxes are due and payable before being returned as delinquent is on the next business day and taxes levied in the immediately preceding year that remain unpaid shall be returned as delinquent on the immediately succeeding business day. Except as otherwise provided in section 79 for certified abandoned property, property delinquent for taxes levied in the second year preceding the forfeiture under section 78g or in a prior year to which this section applies shall be forfeited to the county treasurer for the total of the unpaid taxes, interest, penalties, and fees for those years as provided under section 78g.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A county property tax administration fee of 4% and, except as provided in section 78g(3)(c), interest computed at a noncompounded rate of 1% per month or fraction of a month on the taxes that were originally returned as delinquent, computed from the date that the taxes originally became delinquent, shall be added to property returned as delinquent under this section. A county property tax administration fee provided for under this subsection shall not be less than $1.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Any person with an unrecorded property interest or any other person who wishes at any time to receive notice of the return of delinquent taxes on a parcel of property may pay an annual fee not to exceed $5.00 by February 1 to the county treasurer and specify the parcel identification number, the address of the property, and the address to which the notice shall be sent. Holders of any undischarged mortgages wishing to receive notice of the return of delinquent taxes on a parcel or parcels of property may provide a list of such parcels in a form prescribed by the county treasurer and pay an annual fee not to exceed $1.00 per parcel to the county treasurer and specify for each parcel the parcel identification number, the address of the property, and the address to which the notice should be sent. The county treasurer shall notify the person or holders of undischarged mortgages if delinquent taxes on the property or properties are returned within that year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Notwithstanding any charter provision to the contrary, the governing body of a local governmental unit that collects delinquent taxes may establish for any property, by ordinance, procedures for the collection of delinquent taxes and the enforcement of tax liens and the schedule for the forfeiture or foreclosure of delinquent tax liens. The procedures and schedule established by ordinance shall conform at a minimum to those procedures and schedules established under sections 78a to 78l, except that those taxes subject to a payment plan approved by the treasurer of the local governmental unit as of July 1, 1999 shall not be considered delinquent if payments are not delinquent under that payment plan.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, on March 1 in each tax year, certified abandoned property and property that is delinquent for taxes, interest, penalties, and fees for the immediately preceding 12 months or more is forfeited to the county treasurer for the total amount of those unpaid delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees. If property is forfeited to a county treasurer under this subsection, the foreclosing governmental unit does not have a right to possession of the property until the April 1 immediately succeeding the entry of a judgment foreclosing the property under section 78k or in a contested case until 22 days after the entry of a judgment foreclosing the property under section 78k. If property is forfeited to a county treasurer under this subsection, the county treasurer shall add a $175.00 fee to each property for which those delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees remain unpaid. The fee added under this subsection must be used by the foreclosing governmental unit and the fee added under section 78d must be used by the county treasurer for the administration of sections 78 to 79a, including, but not limited to, costs associated with providing required notices and with the forfeiture, foreclosure, sale, maintenance, repair, and remediation of property. A county treasurer shall withhold a property from forfeiture for any reason determined by the state tax commission. The state tax commission shall determine the procedure for withholding a property from forfeiture under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Not more than 45 days after property is forfeited under subsection (1), the county treasurer shall record with the county register of deeds a certificate in a form determined by the department of treasury for each property forfeited to the county treasurer, specifying that the property has been forfeited to the county treasurer and not redeemed and that absolute title to the property and any equity associated with an interest in the property will vest in the foreclosing governmental unit on the March 31 immediately succeeding the entry of a judgment foreclosing the property under section 78k or in a contested case 21 days after the entry of a judgment foreclosing the property under section 78k. The certificate must include an explanation of the right of a person with an interest in the property at the time a judgment of foreclosure of the property is effective under section 78k to claim that person's interest in any remaining proceeds pursuant to section 78t after a sale or transfer of the property under section 78m. If a certificate of forfeiture is recorded in error, the county treasurer shall record with the county register of deeds a certificate of error in a form prescribed by the department of treasury. A certificate submitted to the county register of deeds for recording under this subsection need not be notarized and may be authenticated by a digital signature of the county treasurer or by other electronic means. If the county has elected under section 78 to have this state foreclose property under this act forfeited to the county treasurer under this section, the county treasurer shall immediately transmit to the department of treasury a copy of each certificate recorded under this subsection. The county treasurer shall upon collection transmit to the department of treasury within 30 days the fee added to each property under subsection (1), which may be paid from the county's delinquent tax revolving fund and upon receipt must be deposited by the department of treasury in the land reutilization fund created under section 78n.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Property forfeited to the county treasurer under subsection (1) may be redeemed at any time on or before the March 31 immediately succeeding the entry of a judgment foreclosing the property under section 78k or in a contested case within 21 days of the entry of a judgment foreclosing the property under section 78k upon payment to the county treasurer of all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The total amount of unpaid delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees for which the property was forfeited or the reduced amount of unpaid delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees payable under subsection (8), if applicable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision and subdivision (c), in addition to the interest calculated under sections 60a(1) or (2) and 78a(3), additional interest computed at a noncompounded rate of 1/2% per month or fraction of a month on the taxes that were originally returned as delinquent, computed from the March 1 preceding the forfeiture. The county treasurer may waive the additional interest under this subdivision if the property is withheld from the petition for foreclosure under section 78h(3)(c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the property is classified as residential real property under section 34c, the property is a principal residence exempt from the tax levied by a local school district for school operating purposes under section 7cc, and a tax foreclosure avoidance agreement is in effect for the property under section 78q(5), while the tax foreclosure avoidance agreement is effective, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The property must be withheld from the petition for foreclosure under section 78h.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The additional interest under subdivision (b) does not apply and interest computed at a noncompounded rate of 1/2% per month or fraction of a month on the taxes that were originally returned as delinquent, computed from the date that the taxes originally were returned as delinquent, applies to the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) All recording fees and all fees for service of process or notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If property is redeemed by a person with a legal interest in the property as provided under subsection (3), any unpaid taxes, interest, penalties, and fees not returned as delinquent to the county treasurer under section 78a are not extinguished.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If property is redeemed by a person with a legal interest in the property as provided under subsection (3), the person redeeming does not acquire a title or interest in the property greater than that person would have had if the property had not been forfeited to the county treasurer, but a person redeeming, other than the owner, is entitled to a lien for the amount paid to redeem the property in addition to any other lien or interest the person may have, which must be recorded within 30 days with the register of deeds by the person entitled to the lien. The lien acquired has the same priority as the existing lien, title, or interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If property is redeemed as provided under subsection (3), the county treasurer shall issue a redemption certificate in quadruplicate in a form prescribed by the department of treasury. One of the quadruplicate certificates must be delivered to the person making the redemption payment, 1 must be filed in the office of the county treasurer, 1 must be recorded in the office of the county register of deeds, and 1 must be immediately transmitted to the department of treasury if this state is the foreclosing governmental unit. The county treasurer shall also make a note of the redemption certificate in the tax record kept in his or her office, with the name of the person making the final redemption payment, the date of the payment, and the amount paid. If the county treasurer accepts partial redemption payments, the county treasurer shall include in the tax record kept in his or her office the name of the person or persons making each partial redemption payment, the date of each partial redemption payment, the amount of each partial redemption payment, and the total amount of all redemption payments. A certificate and the entry of the certificate in the tax record by the county treasurer is evidence of a redemption payment in the courts of this state. A certificate submitted to the county register of deeds for recording under this subsection need not be notarized and may be authenticated by a digital signature of the county treasurer or by other electronic means. If a redemption certificate is recorded in error, the county treasurer shall record with the county register of deeds a certificate of error in a form prescribed by the department of treasury. A copy of a certificate of error recorded under this section must be immediately transmitted to the department of treasury if this state is the foreclosing governmental unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a foreclosing governmental unit has reason to believe that a property forfeited under this section may be the site of environmental contamination, the foreclosing governmental unit shall provide the department of environment, Great Lakes, and energy with any information in the possession of the foreclosing governmental unit that suggests the property may be the site of environmental contamination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Notwithstanding any provision of this act or charter to the contrary, until July 1, 2025, all of the following apply to property for which delinquent property taxes remain unpaid, including property forfeited under this section, located in a local unit of government that, pursuant to subsection (10)(b)(i) or (ii), is participating in a payment reduction program authorized by this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the property is subject to an exemption under section 7u and the property's owner has not previously received a payment reduction under this subsection, the foreclosing governmental unit may do 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the total amount of unpaid delinquent taxes is greater than 10% of the property's taxable value for the calendar year preceding the year the property was exempt from the collection of taxes under section 7u, reduce the amount required to be paid under section 78a(1) or required to be paid to redeem the property under subsection (3)(a) to 10% of the property's taxable value for the calendar year preceding the year the property was exempt from the collection of taxes under section 7u. A reduction under this subparagraph must be allocated to each taxing unit based on the proportion that its unpaid delinquent taxes certified to the county treasurer bear to the total amount of unpaid delinquent taxes certified to the county treasurer in connection with the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Cancel some or all of any unpaid delinquent taxes that represent charges for services that have become delinquent and have been certified to the county treasurer for collection of taxes and enforcement of the lien for the taxes under section 21(3) of the revenue bond act of 1933, 1933 PA 94, MCL 141.121.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Cancel all of the interest, penalties, and fees required to be paid under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the amount required to be paid under this act is reduced under subdivision (a), the foreclosing governmental unit may further reduce the amount by an amount not to exceed 10% of the unpaid delinquent taxes required to be paid to redeem the property if the property is redeemed by a single lump-sum payment made within a period to be determined by the foreclosing governmental unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A foreclosing governmental unit may apply the provisions of this subsection to property subject to a delinquent property tax installment payment plan under section 78q(1) or a tax foreclosure avoidance agreement under section 78q(5). Except as provided in this subdivision, the terms and conditions of a payment reduction applied to property under this subsection must be consistent with the terms and conditions of a delinquent property tax installment payment plan under section 78q(1) or tax foreclosure agreement under section 78q(5) for the property. If the owner of property subject to a delinquent property tax installment payment plan under section 78q(1) or a tax foreclosure avoidance agreement under section 78q(5) has failed to pay any amounts owed under the plan or agreement, that nonpayment does not prohibit the property owner from receiving a payment reduction under this subsection. Notwithstanding any provision of this act to the contrary, the full amount owed by an owner of property as reduced by this subsection must be payable in not more than 3 years after the date the reduction is established by the foreclosing governmental unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If a property owner has paid a reduced amount under this subsection in accordance with the terms, conditions, and time period established by the county treasurer, any remaining unpaid taxes, interest, penalties, and fees otherwise payable shall be canceled by the county treasurer, including, but not limited to, any interest, fee, or penalty payment requirements set forth in a delinquent property tax installment payment plan under section 78q(1) or a tax foreclosure avoidance agreement under section 78q(5) with respect to the property. A county treasurer shall not impose any additional interest, penalties, fees, or other charges of any kind in connection with a payment reduction program under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the owner of property subject to a payment reduction under this subsection fails to pay the full reduced amount of delinquent taxes, penalties, and fees under this subsection in accordance with the terms, conditions, and time period established by the county treasurer, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The amount required to be paid to redeem the property is the sum of both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) The full amount of any unpaid delinquent taxes on the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) Interest under subsection (3)(b) and any additional interest, fees, charges, and penalties otherwise applicable to any unpaid taxes on the property, including, but not limited to, interest, fees, charges, and penalties canceled under subdivision (d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The property must be included in the immediately succeeding petition for foreclosure under section 78h.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A foreclosing governmental unit may not approve a reduction in the amount required to redeem property under this subsection if the reduction would cause noncompliance with section 87c(7) or otherwise impermissibly impair an outstanding debt of the county or any taxing unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) All payments collected in connection with property under this subsection must be distributed to each taxing unit that has certified to the county treasurer unpaid delinquent taxes for the property in an amount based on the proportion that the taxing unit's unpaid delinquent taxes certified to the county treasurer bear to the total amount of unpaid delinquent taxes certified to the county treasurer in connection with the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) A county treasurer shall set forth the terms and benefits of a payment reduction program available under this subsection in a plan available upon request to the department of treasury. The plan must set forth which of the reductions described in subdivisions (a) and (b) are available under the program and must include any other information determined to be necessary or appropriate in the discretion of the county treasurer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If a payment reduction under subsection (8) is in effect for property for which a county has issued notes under this act that are secured by the delinquent taxes and interest on that property, at any time within 2 years after the date that those taxes were returned as delinquent, the county treasurer may charge back to any taxing unit the face amount of the delinquent taxes that were owed to that taxing unit on the date those taxes were returned as delinquent, less the amount of any payments received by the county treasurer on that property. All subsequent payments of delinquent taxes and interest on that property must be retained by the county treasurer in a separate account and either paid to or credited to the account of that taxing unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A foreclosing governmental unit's authority to apply any of the payment-reduction measures otherwise available under subsection (8) is subject to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A foreclosing governmental unit that seeks to implement a program under subsection (8) shall provide written notice to the treasurer of each affected local unit of government within the county in which the property is located of the foreclosing governmental unit's intent to implement the program and state that the local unit of government has the option of participating in the program. The notice must contain all of the terms and conditions to be offered under the program, in addition to any other information that the foreclosing governmental unit considers necessary or appropriate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Not later than 21 days after the foreclosing governmental unit provides the written notice described in subdivision (a), the treasurer of any affected local unit of government may provide the foreclosing governmental unit with 1 of the following, as applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Written notice of nonparticipation in the program, if the local unit of government is located in a county with a population of more than 1,500,000 according to the most recent population estimate produced by the United States Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program (PEP). All property within a local unit of government that provides written notice of nonparticipation under this subparagraph will be excluded from the program. Any affected local unit of government whose treasurer does not provide written notice of nonparticipation under this subparagraph is conclusively presumed to have consented to participation in the program, and all property within that local unit of government will be included in the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Written notice of participation in the program, if the local unit of government is located in a county other than one described in subparagraph (i) and the governing body of the local unit of government has approved a resolution to participate in the program. All property within a local unit of government that provides written notice of participation under this subparagraph will be included in the program. Any affected local unit of government whose treasurer does not provide written notice of participation under this subparagraph is conclusively presumed to have declined to participate in the program, and all property within that local unit of government will be excluded from the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) As used in this section, "local unit of government" means a city, township, or village.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to subsection (1), beginning on the third Tuesday in July immediately succeeding the entry of the judgment under section 78k vesting absolute title to tax delinquent property in the foreclosing governmental unit and ending on the immediately succeeding first Tuesday in November, the foreclosing governmental unit, or its authorized agent, at the option of the foreclosing governmental unit, shall hold 1 or more property sales at 1 or more convenient locations at which property foreclosed by a judgment entered under section 78k will be sold by auction sale, which may include an auction sale conducted via an internet website. Notice of the time and location of a sale must be published not less than 30 days before a sale in a notice publication circulated in the county in which the property is located, if there is one. If no notice publication is circulated in that county, publication must be made in a notice publication circulated in an adjoining county.

Except as provided in this subsection and subsection (5), property must be sold to the person bidding the minimum bid, or if a bid is greater than the minimum bid, the highest amount above the minimum bid. The foreclosing governmental unit may sell properties individually or may offer 2 or more properties for sale as a group.

The foreclosing governmental unit may adopt procedures governing the conduct of the sale and the payment for conveyance of properties under this section and may cancel the sale before the issuance of a deed under this subsection if authorized under the procedures. The foreclosing governmental unit shall require full payment at the close of each day's bidding or by a date not more than 21 days after the sale. Before the foreclosing governmental unit conveys a property sold at a sale, the purchaser shall provide the foreclosing governmental unit with proof of payment to the local tax collecting unit in which the property is located of any property taxes owed on the property at the time of the sale. A foreclosing governmental unit shall cancel a sale if unpaid property taxes owed on a property or properties at the time of a sale are not paid within 21 days of the sale. If a sale is canceled under this subsection, the foreclosing governmental unit may offer the property to the next highest bidder and convey the property to that bidder under this subsection, subject to the requirements of this subsection for the highest bidder. Not more than 14 days after payment to the foreclosing governmental unit of all amounts required by the highest bidder or the next highest bidder under this subsection, the foreclosing governmental unit shall convey the property by deed to the person bidding the minimum bid, or if a bid is greater than the minimum bid, the highest amount above the minimum bid, or the next highest bidder if the sale to the highest bidder is canceled and the next highest bidder pays the amount required under this section to purchase the property. The deed must vest fee simple title to the property in the person bidding the highest amount above the minimum bid, unless the foreclosing governmental unit discovers a defect in the foreclosure of the property under sections 78 to 78l or the sale is canceled under this subsection or subsection (5).

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For sales held under subsection (2), after the conclusion of that sale, and before any additional sale held under subsection (2), a city, village, township, or city authority may purchase any property not previously sold under subsection (1) or (2) by paying the foreclosing governmental unit the minimum bid. If a city, village, township, or city authority does not purchase that property, the county in which that property is located may purchase that property under this section by paying the foreclosing governmental unit the minimum bid. If a city, village, township, city authority, or county does not purchase that property and the property is within the area of a county authority, the county authority may purchase the property under this section by paying the foreclosing governmental unit the minimum bid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If property is purchased by a city, village, township, city authority, county, or county authority under subsection (3), the foreclosing governmental unit shall convey the property to the purchasing city, village, township, city authority, county, or county authority within 30 days.</div>

If the foreclosing governmental unit elects to hold more than 1 sale under subsection (2), the final sale held under subsection (2) must be held not less than 28 days after the immediately preceding sale under subsection (2). At the final sale held under subsection (2), the sale is subject to the requirements of subsection (2), except that the minimum bid is not required. However, the foreclosing governmental unit may establish a reasonable opening bid at the sale to recover the cost of the sale of the property or properties, and the foreclosing governmental unit shall require a person who held an interest in property sold under this subsection at the time a judgment of foreclosure was entered against the property under section 78k to pay the minimum bid for the property before issuing a deed to the person under subsection (2). If the person fails to pay the minimum bid for the property and other amounts by the date required under this section, the foreclosing governmental unit shall cancel the sale of the property.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Notwithstanding any provision of this act or charter to the contrary, a foreclosing governmental unit may create a delinquent property tax installment payment plan for eligible property, the title to which is held by a financially distressed person. A delinquent property tax installment payment plan created under this subsection may be combined with and made subject to a delinquent property tax payment reduction under section 78g(8)(c). Any payment under that delinquent property tax installment payment plan made during a calendar year in which an owner of property is subject to a payment reduction under section 78g(8) must be credited to the amount owed under section 78g(8) and the credit must not exceed the amount owed under section 78g(8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a financially distressed person agrees to participate in a delinquent property tax installment payment plan created under subsection (1) and makes the initial payment required under that delinquent property tax installment payment plan, the foreclosing governmental unit may remove eligible property the title to which is held by that financially distressed person from the petition for foreclosure as provided in section 78h(3)(c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a financially distressed person successfully completes a delinquent property tax installment payment plan created under subsection (1), interest under section 78g(3)(b) and any additional interest otherwise applicable must be waived.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a financially distressed person does not successfully complete a delinquent property tax installment payment plan created under subsection (1), both of the following apply:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The eligible property must be included in the immediately succeeding petition for foreclosure under section 78h.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Notwithstanding any provision of this act or charter to the contrary, until June 30, 2026, a county treasurer may enter into a tax foreclosure avoidance agreement for a term of up to 5 years with an owner of property returned as delinquent to the county treasurer under this act or forfeited to the county treasurer under section 78g if the property is classified as residential real property under section 34c, if the property is eligible property, and if the owner makes an initial payment of the delinquent taxes owed on the property in an amount determined by the county treasurer. A tax foreclosure avoidance agreement entered into under this subsection may be combined with and made subject to a delinquent property tax payment reduction under section 78g(8)(c). Any payment under that tax foreclosure avoidance agreement made during a calendar year in which an owner of property is subject to a payment reduction under section 78g(8) must be credited to the amount owed under section 78g(8) and the credit must not exceed the amount owed under section 78g(8). While a tax foreclosure avoidance agreement is effective, the property must be withheld or removed from the petition for foreclosure as provided under section 78h(3)(c), interest at the rate provided in section 78g(3)(c)(ii) applies, and the owner shall make timely payments as provided under the tax foreclosure avoidance agreement, including timely payment of all nondelinquent taxes on the property. A tax foreclosure avoidance agreement must require regular periodic installment payments. The final payment must not be disproportionately larger than a regular periodic installment payment and regular periodic installment payments in the final year must not be disproportionately larger than regular periodic installment payments in prior years. A county treasurer may refuse to enter into a tax foreclosure avoidance agreement with an owner under this subsection if that owner is not in compliance with another tax foreclosure avoidance agreement with the county treasurer or with a delinquent property tax installment plan with the county treasurer under this section. A county treasurer may not enter into more than 2 tax foreclosure avoidance agreements with an owner. If an owner fails to comply with a tax foreclosure avoidance agreement or if the tax foreclosure avoidance agreement is no longer effective, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Interest under section 78g(3)(b) and any additional interest otherwise applicable apply to any unpaid taxes on the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The property must be included in the immediately succeeding petition for foreclosure under section 78h.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The owner shall not bid on property subject to sale under section 78m, if that property was subject to the tax foreclosure avoidance agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A delinquent property tax installment payment plan or a tax foreclosure avoidance agreement may not be approved under this section if the delinquent property tax installment payment plan or tax foreclosure avoidance agreement would impermissibly impair an outstanding debt of the county.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a foreclosing governmental unit has created a delinquent property tax installment payment plan under this section, the department of treasury may audit the books and records of that foreclosing governmental unit concerning the details of that delinquent property tax installment payment plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Property classified as industrial real property under section 34c that is occupied at less than 10% of its facility capacity for more than 3 years and that is located in a county with a population of more than 1,500,000 according to the most recent federal decennial census is not eligible to participate in a delinquent property tax installment payment plan and is subject to section 78m, including sale under section 78m(2) to the person bidding the highest amount above the minimum bid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If a delinquent property tax installment payment plan is in effect for property for which a county has issued notes under this act that are secured by the delinquent taxes and interest on that property, at any time 2 years after the date that those taxes were returned as delinquent, the county treasurer may charge back to any taxing unit the face amount of the delinquent taxes that were owed to that taxing unit on the date those taxes were returned as delinquent, less the amount of any principal installments received by the county treasurer on that property under the delinquent property tax installment payment plan. All subsequent payments of delinquent taxes and interest on that property must be retained by the county treasurer in a separate account and either paid to or credited to the account of that taxing unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Eligible property" means property that is a principal residence exempt from the tax levied by a local school district for school operating purposes under section 7cc.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Financially distressed person" means a person who meets all of the following conditions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Is eligible to have property to which he or she holds title withheld from a petition for foreclosure under section 78h(3)(b).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) After the foreclosing governmental unit responds to a claimant's motion under this section, the court shall set a hearing date and time for each property for which 1 or more claimants filed a motion under this section and notify each claimant and the foreclosing governmental unit of the hearing date at least 21 days before the hearing date. At the hearing, the court shall determine the relative priority and value of the interest of each claimant in the foreclosed property immediately before the foreclosure was effective. The foreclosing governmental unit may appear at the hearing. The burden of proof of a claimant's interest in any remaining proceeds for a claimant is on the claimant.

The court shall allocate any remaining proceeds based upon its determination and order that the foreclosing governmental unit pay applicable remaining proceeds to 1 or more claimants consistent with its determination under this subsection. An order for the payment of remaining proceeds must not unjustly enrich a claimant at the expense of the public. If a claimant indicated in the motion that the claimant or an entity in which the claimant held a direct or indirect interest purchased the property under section 78m or if the claimant indicated in the motion that the claimant held a direct or indirect interest in the property at the time the motion was filed, the order must require remaining proceeds to be applied to any unpaid obligations payable to a tenant at the time the foreclosure was effective or any unpaid civil fines relating to the property owed at the time the foreclosure was effective for violation of an ordinance authorized by section 4l of the home rule city act, 1909 PA 279, MCL 117.4l, in the local tax collecting unit in which the property is located. The order must provide for the payment of any unpaid amounts not otherwise payable to another claimant owed by a claimant to satisfy a state, federal, or local tax collecting unit tax lien on the property immediately preceding the effective date of the foreclosure under section 78k if the lien had priority over the claimant's interest in the property. The order also must provide that any further claim by a claimant under this act relating to the foreclosed property is barred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The foreclosing governmental unit shall pay the amounts ordered by the court to the claimants and any other persons ordered by the court under subsection (9) within 21 days of the order pursuant to section 78m.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) This section is the exclusive mechanism for a claimant to claim and receive any applicable remaining proceeds under the laws of this state. A right to claim remaining proceeds under this section is not transferable except by testate or intestate succession.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Claimant" means a person with a legal interest in property immediately before the effectiveness of a judgment of foreclosure of the property under section 78k who seeks pursuant to this section recognition of its interest in any remaining proceeds associated with the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Remaining proceeds" means the amount equal to the difference between the amount paid to the foreclosing governmental unit for a property due to the sale or transfer of the property under section 78m and the sum of all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The minimum bid under section 78m.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) All other fees and expenses incurred by the foreclosing governmental unit pursuant to section 78m in connection with the forfeiture, foreclosure, sale, maintenance, repair, and remediation of the property not included in the minimum bid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) A sale commission payable to the foreclosing governmental unit equal to 5% of the amount paid to the foreclosing governmental unit for the property.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The county board of commissioners of any county, on behalf of the taxing units in the county and, for purposes of the state education tax under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, this state, may create a delinquent tax revolving fund that, at the option of the county treasurer, may be designated as the "100% tax payment fund". Upon the establishment of the fund, all delinquent taxes, except taxes on personal property, due and payable to the taxing units in the county, except those units that collect their own delinquent taxes after March 1 by charter or otherwise, are due and payable to the county, on behalf of the taxing units in the county and this state. Money and other property and assets held in the delinquent tax revolving fund shall be kept separate from and shall not be commingled with any other money, property, or assets in the custody of the county treasurer. All money, property, and assets acquired by the county treasurer, whether as revenues or otherwise, shall be held by it in trust for the taxing units in the county for which the taxes are levied. The county shall have no right, title, or interest in the delinquent tax revolving fund except for the right to payment provided for in section 87b(7) or 87c(3). If the county determines to borrow pursuant to section 87c or 87d, that borrowing shall be done on behalf of the county and its taxing units and the primary obligation to pay to the county the amount of taxes and the interest on the taxes shall rest with the local taxing units and this state for the state education tax under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906. If the delinquent taxes that are due and payable to the county are not received by the county on behalf of the taxing units in the county and this state for any reason, the county has full right of recourse against the taxing unit or to this state for the state education tax under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, to recover the amount of the delinquent taxes and interest at the rate of 1% per month or fraction of a month or a lower rate as established by resolution of the board of commissioners until repaid to the county by the taxing unit. However, if the county borrows to provide funds for those payments, the interest rate shall not exceed the highest interest rate paid on that borrowing. If the board of commissioners reduces the interest rate on the recovery of uncollected delinquent taxes as provided in this subsection, that decrease shall not apply to any year's delinquent taxes when borrowing against that year's delinquent taxes occurred before the board of commissioners adopted a resolution to reduce the interest rate on the recovery of uncollected delinquent taxes. Any amount that is due from a local taxing unit or this state for a prior year's uncollected delinquent tax is a lien against any future delinquent tax payments that may be payable to a local taxing unit or this state and the lien shall be satisfied by offsetting the amount due to the county from the local taxing unit or this state when distributions from the delinquent tax revolving fund are made by the county to the local taxing unit or this state in a subsequent year. A resolution or agreement previously executed or adopted to this effect is validated and confirmed. For delinquent state education taxes under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, the county may offset uncollectible delinquent taxes against collections of the state education tax under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, received by the county and owed to this state under this act. The fund shall be segregated into separate funds or accounts for each year's delinquent taxes. A separate delinquent tax revolving fund shall be created for each year's delinquent taxes in any county that elects to borrow under section 87f. This subsection does not restrict a foreclosing governmental unit from selling or transferring property under section 78m or 78r.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a delinquent tax revolving fund is established, the county treasurer shall be the agent for the county, on behalf of the taxing units in the county and this state, and, without further action by the county board of commissioners, may enter into contracts with other municipalities, this state, or private persons, firms, or corporations in connection with any transaction relating to the fund or any borrowing made by the county pursuant to section 87c or 87d, including all services necessary to complete this borrowing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The county treasurer shall pay from the fund any or all delinquent taxes that are due and payable to the county and any school district, intermediate school district, community college district, city, township, special assessment district, this state, or any other political unit for which delinquent tax payments are due within 20 days after sufficient funds are deposited within the delinquent tax revolving fund or, if the county treasurer is treasurer for a county with a population greater than 1,500,000 persons, within 30 days after sufficient funds are deposited within the delinquent tax revolving fund. In a county with a delinquent tax revolving fund where the county does not borrow pursuant to section 87c or 87d, if the county treasurer does not make payment of the delinquent taxes to the local units within 10 days after the completion of county settlement with all local units under section 55, the county shall pay interest on the unpaid delinquent taxes from the date of actual county settlement at the rate of 12% per annum for the number of days involved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as provided in subsection (5), the county treasurer shall pay from the fund directly to a school district its share of the fund when a single school district exists within a political unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a local taxing unit has borrowed money in anticipation of collecting taxes for any school district or other municipality and the county treasurer has been so notified in writing, the county treasurer shall pay to the local taxing unit the shares of the fund for that school district or municipality. For purposes of this subsection, "local taxing unit" means a city, village, or township.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The interest charges, penalties, and county property tax administration fee rates established under this act shall remain in effect and shall be payable to the county delinquent tax revolving fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Any surplus in the fund may be transferred to the county general fund by appropriate action of the county board of commissioners.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A county board of commissioners may borrow money to create a delinquent tax revolving fund as provided in section 87c or 87d, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) This section shall not supersede section 87 but is an alternative method for paying delinquent taxes to local units. However, where this section is used by a county, section 87 shall not be used.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Except for subsection (7), this section may be superseded by section 87f, as provided in section 87f(1).</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 87d.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Notwithstanding section 87c(10), a county which determines to borrow pursuant to section 87c may submit to its voters the question of issuing revolving fund notes at any general or special election, which question shall provide for the establishment of the revolving fund for not to exceed 10 years and shall be in substantially the following form:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Shall the county of __________ establish or continue for __________ years a delinquent tax revolving fund and, in connection with that fund, borrow an amount not to exceed the delinquent taxes pledged for repayment of the borrowing or borrowings, as may be made each year, and issue its general obligation unlimited tax notes, pledging the county's full faith and credit for the purpose of providing money for the delinquent tax revolving fund?"</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a majority of the electors voting on the question vote in favor of the question, the county may proceed to issue the notes as provided for in this act, which notes may be designated general obligation unlimited tax notes. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a majority of the electors voting on the question vote against the question, or if the question is not submitted, the county may also issue the notes but only in accordance with subsection (6).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In addition, this section shall validate a question submitted to the electors before the effective date of this section in which the electors were asked to approve the issuance of general obligation tax notes secured by delinquent taxes, regardless of how the question may have been phrased. The defeat of the question shall require that the notes be issued as nonvoted until a future question is approved by the electors.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A county may submit to its electors the question authorized by this section once each calendar year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If nonvoted notes are issued pursuant to section 87c:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The resolution authorizing the borrowing and issuance of the notes shall establish the pledged delinquent taxes, the interest thereon, and any amounts received in the future from taxing units in the county because of the uncollectibility of any delinquent taxes as funds pledged to note repayment, which amounts shall be placed in a segregated fund and used for no other purpose except to repay the notes and the interest thereon. The resolution shall provide that the expenses of borrowing shall be repaid from the county property tax administration fees on the pledged delinquent taxes and the balance of the county property tax administration fees may be added to the funds pledged to note repayment, if the resolution provides.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The notes shall be designated general obligation limited tax notes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The resolution may establish a special fund to secure the notes referred to as a note reserve fund and shall pay into the note reserve fund any proceeds of sale of the notes to the extent provided in the resolution authorizing issuance of the notes. All money in the note reserve fund, except as hereafter provided, shall be added to the funds pledged to note repayment and shall be used solely for payment of principal and interest on the notes for which the fund was established, or the purchase of notes for which the fund was established. Money in the note reserve fund shall first be withdrawn for payment of principal and interest on notes before other county general funds are used to make the payments. All income or interest earned by, or increment to, the note reserve fund due to its investment or reinvestment shall be deposited in the delinquent tax revolving fund, when the notes for which the fund was established are retired. The resolution shall provide that when the note reserve fund is sufficient to retire the notes and accrued interest thereon, it may be so used.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A resolution which establishes a note reserve fund may provide for an additional borrowing of an amount not to exceed the amount of the reserve, and the county shall have the power to borrow that additional amount.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The notes shall be the full faith and credit obligations of the county issuing them. If the proceeds of the taxes and interest and, when pledged, county property tax administration fees, or note reserve fund are not sufficient to pay the principal and interest, when due, the county shall pay the same from its general funds or any additional tax which may be levied within its constitutional and statutory debt limits, and the county may thereafter reimburse itself from delinquent taxes collected. The county's obligation to pay from its general funds shall be its first budget obligation and shall be provided for in the borrowing resolution in the following language:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   "This note issue, in addition, shall be a general obligation of the county of __________, secured by its full faith and credit, which shall include this county's limited tax obligation, within applicable constitutional and statutory limits, and its general funds. The county budget shall provide that if the pledged delinquent taxes and any other pledged amounts are not collected in sufficient amounts to meet the payments of principal and interest due on these notes, the county, before paying any other budgeted amounts, will promptly advance from its general funds sufficient money to pay that principal and interest."</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If coupon notes are issued, pursuant to section 87c or this section:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Interest shall be payable semiannually or annually.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The coupons shall specify the source from which the notes shall be payable, which may be by reference to the note itself.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The coupons shall contain the facsimile signature of the county treasurer.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) In that year, issue the county's delinquent tax revenue notes pursuant to the revenue bond act of 1933, 1933 PA 94, MCL 141.103 to 141.140, in an amount that will not exceed the aggregate amount of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The delinquent taxes pledged to secure each borrowing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) At the option of the county treasurer and to the extent authorized under subsection (6), a note reserve fund in an amount not to exceed 15% of each borrowing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The cost of issuance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Upon the board of commissioners' passage of the resolution under subsection (1), the delinquent tax revolving fund shall be continued, and the fund may be designated by the county treasurer as the "100% tax payment fund". Thereafter, all delinquent taxes, except taxes on personal property, due and payable to the taxing units in the county, except those units that collect their own delinquent taxes after March 1 by charter or otherwise, are due and payable to the county treasurer, on behalf of the taxing units in the county and this state. Money and other property and assets held in the delinquent tax revolving fund shall be kept separate from and shall not be commingled with any other money, property, or assets in the custody of the county treasurer. All money, property, and assets acquired by the county treasurer, whether as revenues or otherwise, shall be held by it in trust for the taxing units in the county for which the taxes are levied. The county shall have no right, title, or interest in the delinquent tax revolving fund except for the right to payment provided for in sections 87b(7) and 87c(3), and under section 22a(2) of the revenue bond act of 1933, 1933 PA 94, MCL 141.122a. If the county determines to borrow pursuant to section 87c or 87d, that borrowing shall be done on behalf of the county and its taxing units and the primary obligation to pay to the county treasurer the amount of taxes and the interest on the taxes shall rest with the local taxing units and this state for the state education tax under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906. If the delinquent taxes that are due and payable to the county treasurer on behalf of the taxing units in the county and this state are not received by the county treasurer for any reason, the county treasurer has full right of recourse against the taxing unit or to this state for the state education tax under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, to recover the amount of the delinquent taxes and interest at the rate of 1% per month or fraction of a month or a lower rate as established by resolution of the board of commissioners until repaid to the county treasurer by the taxing unit. However, if the county treasurer borrows to provide funds for those payments, the interest rate shall not exceed the highest interest rate paid on that borrowing. If the board of commissioners reduces the interest rate on the recovery of uncollected delinquent taxes as provided in this subsection, that decrease shall not apply to any year's delinquent taxes when borrowing against that year's delinquent taxes occurred before the board of commissioners adopted a resolution to reduce the interest rate on the recovery of uncollected delinquent taxes. Any amount that is due from a local taxing unit or this state for a prior year's uncollected delinquent tax is a lien against any future delinquent tax payments that may be payable to a local taxing unit or this state and the lien shall be satisfied by offsetting the amount due to the county from the local taxing unit or this state when distributions from the delinquent tax revolving fund are made by the county treasurer to the local taxing unit or this state in a subsequent year. A resolution or agreement previously executed or adopted to this effect is validated and confirmed. For delinquent state education taxes under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, the county may offset uncollectible delinquent taxes against collections of the state education tax under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, received by the county and owed to this state under this act. The fund shall be segregated into separate funds or accounts for each year's delinquent taxes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The delinquent taxes returned to the county treasurer shall remain the property of the local units of government and the county treasurer shall solely serve as a collection agent for those delinquent taxes, with a county treasurer or other foreclosing governmental unit authorized to perform collection functions under sections 78 to 78s.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) All of the taxes, interest, fees, and charges required to be collected by the county treasurer by this act related to delinquent taxes shall remain in full force and effect in the event this section applies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Subject to the limitations of subsections (1) and (6), the county treasurer shall have the power to borrow money and issue delinquent tax revenue notes as permitted by the revenue bond act of 1933, 1933 PA 94, MCL 141.101 to 141.140, for the purpose of continuing the delinquent tax revolving fund. Delinquent tax revenue notes issued pursuant to the revenue bond act of 1933, 1933 PA 94, MCL 141.101 to 141.140, shall be secured by a statutory lien on the delinquent taxes from which the borrowing is to be repaid and all other property and assets and any revenues derived from the delinquent taxes and other property and assets that are held in the delinquent tax revolving fund. The lien shall automatically attach without further action or authorization by the county. The lien on the delinquent taxes and all other property and assets that are held in the delinquent tax revolving fund and any revenues derived from those sources shall be valid and binding from the time the notes are executed and delivered. The lien shall automatically attach and be effective, binding, and enforceable against the county, its successors, transferees, and creditors, and all others asserting rights, regardless of whether those parties have notice of the lien and without the need for any physical delivery, recordation, filing, or further act. In addition, the amounts collected that are subject to the lien shall be held in trust for the owners of the notes authorized by this subsection. Any property eligible to be conveyed and properly conveyed to a land bank fast track authority as tax reverted property, as defined by section 3(q) of the land bank fast track act, 2003 PA 258, MCL 124.753, or to this state or a person, city, village, township, or county pursuant to section 78m or 78r shall be released from any lien created under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The resolution adopted pursuant to subsection (1) authorizing the county treasurer to issue delinquent tax revenue notes pursuant to the revenue bond act of 1933, 1933 PA 94, MCL 141.101 to 141.140, shall be approved by the county board of commissioners and, in a charter or unified county, the chief executive officer of the county in the manner authorized under the charter or by law. The resolution shall also specify the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The existence of a note reserve, if any, to meet any possible future deficiencies in the note and interest redemption account created for a note.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The reasonable excess amount of the reserve authorized to be created to secure the delinquent tax revenue notes and the maximum size of the reserve, which shall not exceed 15% of the principal amount of the notes to be issued.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The amount of any excess delinquent taxes, if any, that may be set to fund or provide for a reserve for future deficiencies in amounts available to repay the county's delinquent tax revenue notes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Any additional security under section 7b(5) or (6) of the revenue bond act of 1933, 1933 PA 94, MCL 141.107b.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 107.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The requirements of this act relating to the amount and imposition of interest, penalties, collection or administration fees, the procedures for collection of taxes, and the enforcement of tax liens are applicable to all cities and villages if not inconsistent with their respective charters or an ordinance enacted pursuant to their respective charters. In addition to the methods authorized under section 108, a city or village, which by its charter does not return its delinquent taxes to the county for collection, may enforce the tax liens for delinquent taxes, assessments, and charges by foreclosure proceedings or any other method authorized under statute, charter, or ordinance enacted pursuant to law or charter. Notwithstanding any provision of this act to the contrary, a charter of a city or township may authorize the establishment of procedures requiring protests to the board of review to be first addressed to the assessor or other agency of the city or township as a prerequisite for a protest before the board of review if the assessor or other agency to whom a protest is first addressed does not have the authority to deny the petitioner the right to protest before the board of review.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For purposes of this act, reference to supervisor, township treasurer, and board of review includes assessing and collecting officers and boards whose duty it is to review an assessment roll. The word township may include city, ward, village, or, if in relation to property tax collection functions, any other local property tax collecting unit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In an incorporated city, the charter of which does not provide for a board of review, the board of review shall consist of the supervisors or other officers making the assessment, the city attorney, and additional members to be appointed by the common council, who shall not be aldermen, equaling the number of supervisors or assessing officers. The session of the board of review shall be held at the council room on the same days as designated in this act for the meeting of the township board of review, unless otherwise provided by the charter of the city, and the proceedings shall be conducted in the same manner as provided in this act. The board of review shall elect a chairperson and clerk, who shall certify to the correctness of the several assessment rolls when completed, substantially as the form prescribed in sections 29 and 30. The appointed members of the board of review shall take the constitutional oath of office, which shall be filed in the office of the city recorder or clerk.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   For taxes levied before January 1, 1997, at any time before the redemption period provided under section 131e has expired, a person who holds a tax lien from a city pursuant to the Michigan tax lien sale and collateralized securities act, 1998 PA 379, MCL 211.921 to 211.941, may also purchase a county tax lien. A county tax lien purchased under this section shall be transferred by the county or by this state to the purchaser upon receipt of an amount equal to the delinquent taxes, charges, assessments, penalties, interest, and fees represented by the county tax lien. This subsection only applies to county tax liens on property for which the purchaser holds a tax lien from a city.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   For taxes levied before January 1, 1997, a person who purchased a county tax lien under this section may enforce that county tax lien and collect the amounts secured by that county tax lien, together with any interest and penalties that accrued before or after the purchase, in any manner that the city is authorized to use to enforce and collect a tax lien for taxes collected by the city. A county tax lien sold under this section is a preferred or first claim upon the property subject to the lien in the same manner as if the city held the tax lien. A county tax lien purchaser shall not take any action to enforce or collect a county tax lien that the city is not authorized to take to enforce and collect a tax lien for taxes collected by the city.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   For taxes levied before January 1, 1997, if a county tax lien is purchased pursuant to this section, the portion of the county tax lien that represents delinquent taxes, charges, and assessments is subject to interest and penalties at the same rate as interest and penalties on delinquent taxes, charges, and assessments subject to collection by the city. However, the maximum amount of penalties charged before and after the purchase of the tax lien shall not exceed the maximum amount of penalties that may be imposed by the city for delinquent taxes, charges, and assessments subject to collection by the city. A person who purchases a county tax lien pursuant to this section may retain any delinquent taxes, interest, and penalties collected for delinquent taxes, charges, and assessments subject to the county tax lien purchased.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   For taxes levied before January 1, 1997, a pledge of tax liens or earnings, revenues, other money, or assets from enforcement of county tax liens purchased pursuant to this section is valid and binding from the time the pledge is made without any filing, recording, or other requirement of notice. The tax liens, earnings, revenues, other money, or assets pledged by a person who purchased a tax lien are immediately subject to the lien of the pledge without physical delivery or further act. The lien of the pledge of tax liens, earnings, revenues, other money, or assets is valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the purchaser whether or not those parties have notice of the lien of the pledge. Any instrument by which a pledge is created is not required to be recorded.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   For taxes levied before January 1, 1997, a city that does not return its delinquent taxes to the county for collection pursuant to its charter shall commence a civil action to foreclose its lien for any delinquent taxes, assessments, and charges subject to collection by the city on real property for which a prior lien has been obtained from the city pursuant to the Michigan tax lien sale and collateralized securities act. Foreclosure proceedings required under this subsection shall commence within 3 years after the date the taxes, assessments, and charges subject to collection by the city become delinquent. Foreclosure proceedings on a lien shall not be required under this subsection if either of the following circumstances exists:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The subsequent tax lien on the same property is conveyed pursuant to the Michigan tax lien sale and collateralized securities act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The prior tax lien conveyed pursuant to the Michigan tax lien sale and collateralized securities act has been satisfied or extinguished.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   For taxes levied after December 31, 1996, at any time before the redemption period provided under section 78g has expired, a person who holds a tax lien from a city pursuant to the Michigan tax lien sale and collateralized securities act, 1998 PA 379, MCL 211.921 to 211.941, may also purchase a county tax lien. A county tax lien purchased under this section shall be transferred by the county or by this state to the purchaser upon receipt of an amount equal to the delinquent taxes, charges, assessments, penalties, interest, and fees represented by the county tax lien. This subsection only applies to county tax liens on property for which the purchaser holds a tax lien from a city.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   For taxes levied after December 31, 1996, a person who purchased a county tax lien under subsection (9) may enforce that county tax lien and collect the amounts secured by that county tax lien, together with any interest and penalties that accrued before or after the purchase, in the manner provided under sections 78 to 78k only, notwithstanding any city charter provisions to the contrary. A county tax lien sold under subsection (9) is a preferred or first claim upon the property subject to the lien in the same manner as if the city held the tax lien. A county tax lien purchaser shall not take any action to enforce or collect a county tax lien that is not authorized under sections 78 to 78n.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   For taxes levied after December 31, 1996, if a county tax lien is purchased pursuant to subsection (9), the portion of the county tax lien that represents delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees is subject to interest, penalties, and fees as provided under sections 78 to 78k. A person who purchases a county tax lien pursuant to subsection (9) may retain any delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees collected for delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees subject to the county tax lien purchased. The fees levied under sections 78 to 78k shall not be levied more than 1 time on each parcel in each tax year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   For taxes levied after December 31, 1996, a pledge of tax liens or earnings, revenues, other money, or assets from enforcement of county tax liens purchased pursuant to subsection (9) is valid and binding from the time the pledge is made without any filing, recording, or other requirement of notice. The tax liens, earnings, revenues, other money, or assets pledged by a person who purchased a tax lien are immediately subject to the lien of the pledge without physical delivery or further act. The lien of the pledge of tax liens, earnings, revenues, other money, or assets is valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the purchaser whether or not those parties have notice of the lien of the pledge. Any instrument by which a pledge is created is not required to be recorded.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   As used in this section, "county tax lien" means the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   As used in subsections (4) to (8), an interest in or encumbrance upon property for taxes levied before January 1, 1997, and charges, assessments, penalties, interest, or fees on those taxes that are returned as delinquent to a county treasurer or, after being returned as delinquent and bid off to this state pursuant to section 70, the state treasurer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   As used in subsections (9) to (12), an interest in or encumbrance upon property for taxes levied after December 31, 1996, charges, assessments, penalties, interest, or fees that are returned as delinquent to a county treasurer.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 108.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If not provided in the charter of a city or village, the governing body of a city or village may provide by ordinance for the return of all unpaid taxes on real property to the county treasurer in the same manner and with the same effect as returns by township treasurers. The words and characters by which the property is described on the village delinquent tax roll shall be the same as the words and characters used to describe the property as it appears on the regular roll of the local tax collecting unit. The county treasurer shall reject, as provided in section 55, any description returned by the treasurer of a local tax collecting unit that does not agree with the description as it appears on the regular tax roll for the same year. The taxes returned shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes returned delinquent under this act. The governing body of a city or village, which by its charter has the right to sell property for unpaid taxes or assessments, may provide for judicial sale of that property. The city or village sale shall be made on petition filed in behalf of the city or village in interest, and shall conform, as near as practicable, to the provisions for a sale under this act. However, if property is offered at a city or village sale that has been bid off or forfeited to this state at any tax sale or forfeiture made under this act, and the bid or forfeiture remains undischarged, a sale of that property at the city or village tax sale is conditioned upon the payment of the tax lien held by this state on the property and the city or village tax sale is void if the tax lien held by this state remains unsatisfied.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 152.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    After the various assessment rolls required to be made under this act or under the provisions of any municipal charter have been passed upon by the several boards of review, and prior to the making and delivery of the tax rolls to the proper officer for collection of taxes, and in no case later than the first Monday in May, the several assessment rolls shall be subject to inspection by the state tax commission or by any member or duly authorized representative thereof. If it appears to the commission after such investigation, or is made to appear to the commission by written complaint of any taxpayer, or assessing officer, that property subject to taxation has been omitted from or improperly described upon the roll or individual assessments have not been made in compliance with law, the commission may issue an order directing the assessor whose assessments are to be reviewed to appear with his assessment roll and the sworn statements of the person or persons whose property or whose assessments are to be considered at a time and place to be stated in the order, the time to be not less than 14 days from the date of the issuance of the order, and the place to be at the office of the board of supervisors at the county seat or at such other place in the county in which the roll was made as the commission shall deem most convenient for the hearing herein provided. A written complaint by a taxpayer or assessing officer shall be deemed to have been filed timely if it was deposited in the United States mail on or before the first Monday of May. No written complaint of any taxpayer shall be accepted by the state tax commission unless the taxpayer has protested the assessment from which he appeals to the board of review. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A notice of the hearing shall be sent by registered mail, with return receipt requested, to all persons whose assessments are to be considered, at their last known address, except that where the commission shall conduct a general review of all assessments within the taxing district, such notice shall be by publication in a newspaper published in the county, if there be any. If no newspaper is published in the county, then the notice shall be by publication in a newspaper with general circulation in the county, at least 5 days before the date of the hearings. A copy of the order shall also be served upon the supervisor or assessing officer in whose possession the roll shall be at least 14 days before he is required to appear with the roll. The commission, or any member or duly authorized representative thereof, shall appear at the time and place mentioned in the order, and the supervisor or assessing officer upon whom notice shall have been served shall appear also with the assessment roll. The commission or any member or duly authorized representatives thereof shall then and there hold a hearing as to the proper assessment of all property and persons mentioned in the notice, and all persons affected or liable to be affected by review of the assessments thus provided for may appear and be heard at the hearing. In any case where the hearings shall be held by a duly authorized representative of the state tax commission, he shall report the facts brought forth at the hearing to the members of the state tax commission, who will determine the true and lawful assessment or change in the description of property as found necessary.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In case the commission, or member thereof, who shall act in the review, shall determine that the assessments so reviewed are not assessed according to law, he or they shall, in a column provided for that purpose, place opposite the property the true and lawful assessment of it. Any increase or decrease of the assessment by such action shall also increase or decrease the state equalized value of the local unit wherein the property is located by the amount that such property's state equalized value has been altered. As to the property not upon the assessment roll, the commission, or member thereof acting in the review, shall place it upon the assessment roll by proper description and shall place thereafter, in the proper column, the true cash value of the property. As to property not properly described upon the assessment roll, the commission, or member thereof acting in the review, shall make such change in the description of the property assessed as is found necessary. The commission shall also spread upon the roll a certificate, signed by the chairman, showing the day and date on which the assessment roll was reviewed. For appearing with the roll as required herein the supervisor or assessing officer shall receive the same per diem as is received by him while in attendance at the meeting of the board of supervisors, to be presented to and paid by the proper officer of the municipality of which he is the assessing officer in the manner as his other compensation is paid. In all of its proceedings the contested case provisions of Act No. 197 of the Public Acts of 1952 as amended, shall not be applicable to the state tax commission, and in its determination, article VI, section 28, of the constitution of the state of Michigan shall apply.

</P>
<P>Sec. 152a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Notwithstanding any other provision of the law to the contrary if an appeal is filed with the state tax commission under section 152 the taxes shall be apportioned and levied on the valuation of the property as fixed by the board of review and equalized under section 34. The taxes shall be due and payable and subject to the same collection fees and interest in the same manner and amount as if an appeal had not been filed. When the valuation is established by the state tax commission appeals decision the tax collecting officer having the tax roll in his possession shall make the necessary adjustments to the tax liability. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If additional taxes are due they may be paid to the collecting officer with the addition of a collection fee of 1% of the additional tax for a period of 60 days after the taxpayer receives notification of the increased tax liability. After the 60-day period such taxes shall be considered delinquent and commencing March 1 following the year of the levy shall be subject to the same collection fees and interest charges as other delinquent taxes. The notification of increased tax liability shall be sent to the taxpayer shown in the roll by the collecting officer by certified mail, return receipt requested, within 5 days after receiving notification from the tax commission of the valuation established. The notification shall be sent by the state tax commission to all taxing units involved, to the county treasurer and the city or township treasurer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the tax liability is decreased due to a decreased valuation and an overpayment of taxes has been made to the collecting officer, the tax collecting officer having possession of the tax roll or delinquent tax roll shall make a refund of the tax overpayment. There shall be added to the tax overpayment refund a proportionate share of the collection fees paid. The collection fee rebate shall be computed by multiplying the total collection fee paid by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of tax refund and the denominator of which is the total tax paid. The officer making the refund shall charge back such refund to all taxing units in the same proportion as the originally collected tax was distributed. The chargeback may be made prior to or subsequent to the payment of the refund to the taxpayer in the discretion of the county, city or township treasurer.</DIV>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>211.154 Incorrect reporting or omission of property liable to taxation; placement of corrected assessment value on assessment roll; certification of taxes due; change in assessment; collection of additional taxes; penalty and interest; refund of excess tax payments; appeal.</B><P>
</P>
<P>Sec. 154.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the state tax commission determines that property subject to the collection of taxes under this act, including property subject to taxation under 1974 PA 198, MCL 207.551 to 207.572, 1905 PA 282, MCL 207.1 to 207.21, 1953 PA 189, MCL 211.181 to 211.182, and the commercial redevelopment act, 1978 PA 255, MCL 207.651 to 207.668, has been incorrectly reported or omitted for any previous year, but not to exceed the current assessment year and 2 years immediately preceding the date the incorrect reporting or omission was discovered and disclosed to the state tax commission, the state tax commission shall place the corrected assessment value for the appropriate years on the appropriate assessment roll. The state tax commission shall issue an order certifying to the treasurer of the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of a tax roll for a year for which an assessment change is made or the county treasurer if the county has possession of a tax roll for a year for which an assessment change is made the amount of taxes due as computed by the correct annual rate of taxation for each year except the current year. Taxes computed under this section shall not be spread against the property for a period before the last change of ownership of the property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If an assessment change made under this section results in increased property taxes, the additional taxes shall be collected by the treasurer of the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of a tax roll for a year for which an assessment change is made or by the county treasurer if the county has possession of a tax roll for a year for which an assessment change is made. Not later than 20 days after receiving the order certifying the amount of taxes due under subsection (1), the treasurer of the local tax collecting unit if the local tax collecting unit has possession of a tax roll for a year for which an assessment change is made or the county treasurer if the county has possession of a tax roll for a year for which an assessment change is made shall submit a corrected tax bill, itemized by taxing jurisdiction, to each person identified in the order and to the owner of the property on which the additional taxes are assessed, if different than a person named in the order, by first-class mail, address correction requested. Except for real property subject to taxation under 1974 PA 198, MCL 207.551 to 207.572, 1905 PA 282, MCL 207.1 to 207.21, 1953 PA 189, MCL 211.181 to 211.182, and the commercial redevelopment act, 1978 PA 255, MCL 207.651 to 207.668, and for real property only, if the additional taxes remain unpaid on the March 1 in the year immediately succeeding the year in which the state tax commission issued the order certifying the additional taxes under subsection (1), the real property on which the additional taxes are due shall be returned as delinquent to the county treasurer. Real property returned for delinquent taxes under this section, and upon which taxes, interest, penalties, and fees remain unpaid after the property is returned as delinquent to the county treasurer, is subject to forfeiture, foreclosure, and sale for the enforcement and collection of the delinquent taxes as provided in sections 78 to 79a.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4), a corrected tax bill based on an assessment roll corrected for incorrectly reported or omitted personal property that is issued after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection shall include penalty and interest at the rate of 1.25% per month or fraction of a month from the date the taxes originally could have been paid without interest or penalty. If the tax bill has not been paid within 60 days after the corrected tax bill is issued, interest shall again begin to accrue at the rate of 1.25% per month or fraction of a month.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a person requests that an increased assessment due to incorrectly reported or omitted personal property be added to the assessment roll under this section before March 1, 2004 with respect to statements filed or required to be filed under section 19 for taxes levied before January 1, 2004, and the corrected tax bill issued under this subsection is paid within 30 days after the corrected tax bill is issued, that person is not liable for any penalty or interest on that portion of the additional tax attributable to the increased assessment resulting from that request. However, a person who pays a corrected tax bill issued under this subsection more than 30 days after the corrected tax bill is issued is liable for the penalties and interest imposed under subsection (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, the treasurer of the local tax collecting unit or the county treasurer shall disburse the payments of interest received to this state and to a city, township, village, school district, county, and authority, in the same proportion as required for the disbursement of taxes collected under this act. The amount to be disbursed to a local school district, except for that amount of interest attributable to mills levied under section 1211(2) or 1211c of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1211 and 380.1211c, and mills that are not included as mills levied for school operating purposes under section 1211 of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1211, shall be paid to the state treasury and credited to the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963. For an intermediate school district receiving state aid under section 56, 62, or 81 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1656, 388.1662, and 388.1681, of the interest that would otherwise be disbursed to or retained by the intermediate school district, all or a portion, to be determined on the basis of the tax rates being utilized to compute the amount of the state school aid, shall be paid instead to the state treasury and credited to the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If an assessment change made under this section results in a decreased tax liability, a refund of excess tax payments shall be made by the county treasurer and shall include interest at the rate of 1% per month or fraction of a month for taxes levied before January 1, 1997 and interest at the rate provided under section 37 of the tax tribunal act, 1973 PA 186, MCL 205.737, for taxes levied after December 31, 1996, from the date of the payment of the tax to the date of the payment of the refund. The county treasurer shall charge a refund of excess tax payments under this subsection to the various taxing jurisdictions in the same proportion as the taxes levied.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A person to whom property is assessed under this section may appeal the state tax commission's order to the Michigan tax tribunal.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the total amount of taxes levied against property for all purposes in any 1 year must not exceed the limits provided by or fixed under section 6 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963, except taxes, known and referred to as debt service tax rates, levied for the payment of interest and principal on obligations incurred before December 8, 1932. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a municipal corporation is limited by a provision in its charter or general law in its power to levy taxes against property for purposes authorized by law to be supported under the municipal budget, the municipal corporation shall levy the taxes under those provisions and those taxes, known and referred to as charter tax rates, are in addition to the taxes that may be levied under the limitation set forth in subsection (1). If any portion of the net limitation tax rate is allocated to the municipal corporation by the board, the allocated tax rate must be included within the total tax rate levied by the municipal corporation under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If any local unit holds an election for the purpose of increasing the total tax rate limitation, as provided for by section 6 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963, the vote at the election must be taken by ballot and the ballots must be cast and counted in the manner provided by the general election laws of this state. The ballots must state the amount in dollars per thousand dollars of taxable value by which it is proposed that the total tax rate limitation on property in the local unit be increased and the number of years for which it is proposed that the increase will be effective. If a previous increase in the total tax limitation on property is about to expire and a new increase for the identical amount levied in the immediately preceding year or a lesser amount is proposed, the ballot proposal may be presented as a renewal or continuation of the previous increase for a specified number of years. The ballot must specify the intended purpose of the renewed or new funds. The ballot may also state the purpose for which the funds derived from the voted increase over the constitutional tax rate limitation may be used, and the board shall not consider those funds in dividing the net limitation tax rate among the various governmental units under this act. Within 5 days after every election held in any local unit to increase the tax rate limitation, a certified copy of the official declaration of the result of the election must be filed with the treasurer of the county or counties in which the local unit is located. The voted increase in the tax rate limitation is effective in the local unit only when the certified copy of the official declaration of the result of the election is filed. The notice of an election under section 653a of the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.653a, for an election at which a proposal for an increase in the total tax rate limitation is to be voted upon must, in addition to listing the proposal, include a statement that includes the amount in dollars per thousand dollars of taxable value by which it is proposed under the proposal that the total tax rate limitation on property in the local unit be increased and the number of years for which it is proposed that the increase will be effective.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) As used in this section, "taxable value" means that value determined under section 27a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.27a.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The tax rate in mills allocated for charter county purposes pursuant to subsection (3) plus the tax rate in mills that is provided by law for state purposes and is in force and effect on the last day specified by this act for the filing of budgets and statements of local units with the board, except tax rates levied for the purpose of payment of interest and principal on state obligations incurred before December 8, 1932, shall be deducted from the maximum tax rates determined pursuant to section 3(1) as the tax rates fixed by section 6 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 without approval of the voters. The remainder of these maximum tax rates determined pursuant to section 3(1), after deducting the total tax rates levied for state purposes and a tax rate in mills allocated for charter county purposes pursuant to subsection (3), if any, shall be known and referred to as the net limitation tax rate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a state tax is levied for any year other than 1994, the state treasurer shall notify by registered mail the county clerk of each county, on or before the day after the last day provided by this act for the filing of budgets and statements of local units with the board, stating the total amount of the state tax rates. On or before September 1 of each year, the state treasurer shall notify by registered mail the county clerk of each county of any change in the amount of the tax rate for state purposes in that county that is necessitated by state equalization of county assessed valuations.

</P>
<P>Sec. 11.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The board shall examine the budgets and statements of local units that are filed with it, and shall determine the tax rates, exclusive of debt service tax rates, that are required pursuant to its proposed budget. The board may request additional statements and examine financial records to verify the tax rate request of a local unit. For the purpose of determining its tax rate, a local unit shall submit a statement accounting for the amount of money contained in the budget stabilization fund. In submitting the budget to the board, the amount contained in the budget stabilization fund shall not be a factor used by the board in determination of the tax rate, if that amount does not exceed the permitted level of funding for that fund as provided by law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the board finds that the total of all tax rates that are required to be levied on property located within the area of a local unit does not exceed the net limitation tax rate, the board shall approve the tax rates as maximum tax rates, except tax rates required to be determined under subsections (3) to (8).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the board finds that the total of all tax rates that are required to be levied on property located within the area of a local unit exceeds the net limitation tax rate, the board shall proceed according to subsections (4), (5), and (6).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The board shall approve minimum tax rates for the county if other than a charter county, of 3 mills; for community college districts organized after April 15, 1957, of 1/4 of 1 mill; for intermediate school districts, 1/10 of 1 mill; for townships other than charter townships, of 1 mill; and to a first-class school district to be collected and paid by the school district to the public library commission existing in the district for services of an educational nature rendered by the library to the residents of that school district, of .64 mills. If the community college district votes to increase the total tax limitation as provided in section 6 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963, the board, during the period the increase is in effect, shall not allocate the 1/4 of 1 mill minimum tax rate to the community college district, but the community college district shall raise all of its tax revenues from the amount of increase so voted. A local unit shall not be allowed a tax rate in excess of what is required pursuant to its proposed budget.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The board shall divide the balance of the net limitation tax rate between all local units after due consideration of the needs of the several local units, the importance to the public of functions of local units that may have to be curtailed, the need of local units for construction or repair of public works, the proposed or accomplished transfer of functions from 1 local unit to others, and other facts or matters concerning the operations of local units that the board considers relevant. A local unit shall not be allowed a tax rate in excess of what is required pursuant to its proposed budget. The board shall approve a maximum limitation tax rate to be levied from the tax rate fixed by section 6 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 without approval of the voters for each local unit consisting of the minimum tax rate, if any, provided in subsection (4), added to the tax rate determined under this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The board shall approve a maximum tax rate for each local unit that votes to increase the total tax rate limitation as provided in the last sentence of the first paragraph of section 6 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963, and as provided for in this act. The maximum tax rate for each local unit, with other maximum tax rates that may be levied within the area of the local unit, shall not exceed the limitation voted. In approving a maximum limitation tax rate under subsection (5) for the various local units, the board shall not take into consideration any increase of the tax rate limitation voted by a local unit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The board shall not approve a tax rate for a local unit that does not submit a budget or statements as required.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The approval by the board of a maximum tax rate for a local unit, which will necessitate a reduction in the total proposed expenditures as listed in the budget of the local unit, shall not be construed as a reduction or elimination of any specific items in the list of proposed expenditures, and the board may not reduce or eliminate those specific items. A local unit, in the budget of which a reduction in the total proposed expenditure is necessitated by the action of the board, or of the state tax commission on an appeal, may revise its budget and amend and alter its tax levy to the extent made necessary by that action. Budgets previously prepared to be met from taxes levied pursuant to this act may likewise be revised.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   Beginning in 1994, the number of mills that may be allocated by the board under this section shall be reduced by the number of mills in excess of the mills levied under the state education tax act, Act No. 331 of the Public Acts of 1993, being sections 211.901 to 211.906 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, allocated to a local school district, other than to a first class school district for payment to the public library commission existing in the district, for school district operating purposes in 1993 and the board shall not allocate mills to a local school district for school district operating purposes.</DIV>

In the case of any school district lying partly within and partly without the limits of a municipal corporation the following procedure shall be observed: The commission shall find, in accordance with the provisions of the property tax limitation act the maximum tax rate which may be levied against all of the property lying within such school district. Such tax rate is hereinafter referred to as the "regular tax rate". Thereafter the commission shall find the maximum additional tax rate which fairly and reasonably is equivalent to and represents the additional annual value to the property lying within the boundaries of the municipal corporation resulting from the greater proximity of the school buildings and facilities to such property and the greater accessibility thereof, and not already reflected in assessed valuations. In no case shall the additional tax rate be such as to increase beyond the net limitation tax rate the total of all taxes levied against property within the limits of such municipal corporation, exclusive of rates levied for the payment of interest and principal on obligations incurred prior to December 8, 1932, and rates levied pursuant to the provisions of the charter of such municipal corporation. The findings and order of the commission made and entered concerning the maximum tax rates of such school district shall specify both the maximum regular tax rate and the maximum additional tax rate computed as aforesaid.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   As used in this act: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Low grade iron ore" means iron-bearing rock, also known as iron formation, jasper, ferruginous chert, or ferruginous slate, that is not merchantable as ore in its natural state and from which a merchantable product can be produced only by beneficiation or treatment involving fine grinding.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Low grade iron ore mining property" means mineral bearing land from which low grade iron ore is mined, and includes the beneficiation or treatment plants, and other necessary land, buildings, facilities, equipment, tools, and supplies used in connection with the mining, transportation, and beneficiation or treatment of the low grade iron ore in producing merchantable iron ore pellets or other concentrated or agglomerated products. For the 1987 tax year only, low grade iron ore mining property includes a coal-fired power generating facility or a portion of a coal-fired power generating facility if all of the following conditions are met:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The power generating facility or portion of the power generating facility has a manufacturer's rated capacity of 400 megawatts or less and produces power that for 1987 is reserved for use by other low grade iron ore mining property before that power is used for other purposes. Not more than 30 days after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subparagraph, the owner of the power generating facility on tax day of the 1987 tax year shall certify the portion of the facility reserved for first use by the mining operation for 1987.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)    The power generating facility or portion of the power generating facility is owned directly or indirectly on tax day of the 1987 tax year by a person or corporation that owns directly or indirectly at least 15% of the other low grade iron ore mining property for which the power is reserved.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Beginning with the first calendar year after production of merchantable ore from a low grade iron ore mining property has been established on a commercial basis, the low grade iron ore mining property shall be subject to a specific tax equal to the average annual production in gross tons during the preceding 5-year period, multiplied by 1.1% or beginning December 31, 2001 through December 31, 2006 0.75% of the mine value per gross ton, based on the average natural iron analysis of shipments for that year of the iron ore pellets or of the concentrated or agglomerated products. A year in which production did not take place shall be excluded in computing the average production but only until the property has a 5-year record of commercial production. Mine value is determined by subtracting from the published lower lake price of Lake Superior iron ore pellets, or the particular concentrated or agglomerated products as of December 31, for the subsequent calendar year, all the transportation and handling costs, including any tax charged for transporting or handling the iron ore pellets or products, from the mining property to Lake Erie ports.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   As used in this section, "lower lake price" means the base price of Lake Superior district iron ore pellets or of the particular concentrated or agglomerated products at rail of vessel at lower lake ports as published in "Iron Age" published in New York City, New York, and "Industry Week" published in Cleveland, Ohio. If either "Iron Age" or "Industry Week" is not published or does not publish a price, a replacement trade journal recognized and generally accepted as reliable by the iron ore industry shall be substituted. If "Iron Age" or "Industry Week" do not publish the same price, if 1 of the trade journals publishes 2 different prices, or if the replacement trade journal does not publish a price, the price shall be the generally prevailing market price at which iron ore pellets or concentrated or agglomerated products, of comparable quality and utility, are being offered for sale in comparable quantity by or on behalf of bona fide producers from sources in the continental United States or Canada.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the specific tax determined under section 3 is less than the specific tax determined under section 2, then section 2 shall govern.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The township supervisor shall remove from the list of land descriptions assessed and taxed under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157, the land descriptions of property taxed under this act, and shall enter the land descriptions on a separate roll. The township supervisor shall spread the specific tax against the property and the township treasurer shall collect the specific tax at the same time, in the same manner, and subject to the same collection charges as general property taxes under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157. Property listed and taxed under this act shall be subject to return and sale for nonpayment of taxes in the same manner, at the same time, and under the same penalties as property returned and sold for nonpayment of taxes levied under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157. A valuation shall not be determined for a description listed under this act and the property shall not be considered by the county board of commissioners or by the state board of equalization in connection with county or state equalization for taxation purposes. If a low grade iron ore mining property is located in more than 1 township, the state geologist shall determine the portion attributable to each township. Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6), sums collected under this act shall be distributed by the township treasurer to school districts, this state, and to local governmental units in the same proportion as the general property taxes are distributed. The amounts distributed may be used by the school districts and local governmental units for operating expenses, for capital improvements, and for the accumulation of reserves in a building and site fund or for the payment of interest or principal on bonds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The tax provided in this act shall be in lieu of an ad valorem tax on any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The low grade iron ore.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The low grade iron ore mining property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The mining of the low grade iron ore mining property.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Land occupied by or used in connection with the mining, transportation, and beneficiation of the ore and shipping of iron ore pellets or other concentrated or agglomerated merchantable products.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   For specific taxes levied after 1993, to determine the proportion for the disbursement of taxes under this section and for attribution of taxes under subsection (5) for the specific taxes collected pursuant to this act, the number of mills levied for local school district operating purposes to be used in the calculation shall equal the number of mills for local school district operating purposes levied in 1993 minus the number of mills levied under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, for the year for which the disbursement is calculated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   For specific taxes levied after 1993 and school operating purposes, the amount that would otherwise be disbursed to a local school district shall be paid instead to the state treasury and credited to the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The proceeds of the specific tax levied under subsection (1) beginning December 31, 2001 through December 31, 2006 shall be distributed as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   To school districts and local governmental units the same amount that they would have been entitled to receive if the specific tax rate were 1.1%.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   After the distribution under subdivision (a) is made, the remaining proceeds shall be deposited into the state school aid fund.</DIV>

The amount of the jeopardy personal property tax shall be determined therefrom. Upon collection of the amount of the jeopardy tax, the treasurer shall forthwith discharge the jeopardy tax assessment affidavit from the records of the register of deeds.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Any personal property which is the subject of a jeopardy assessment hereunder shall remain on the regular tax roll, and no taxpayer or personal property shall be relieved from the tax thereafter assessed thereon, but the treasurer upon receiving the regular tax roll of 1 or more of the units on whose behalf such a jeopardy assessment was made shall credit any amount collected in satisfaction of the jeopardy tax against the regular tax and shall thereupon transfer such sums from the jeopardy tax account to the tax funds of the unit or units for which the jeopardy assessment was made.

If less than the full amount of the jeopardy tax was collected, each unit on whose behalf the jeopardy tax was assessed shall be paid in the proportion that its jeopardy tax bears to the entire jeopardy tax assessment, but no unit shall be paid a sum in excess of its regular personal property tax. Upon payment of all regular personal property taxes owed to all units in whose behalf a jeopardy assessment was made, the balance collected in satisfaction of such jeopardy tax remaining in the treasurer's hands shall be paid over to the taxpayer. The balance of any regular personal property tax remaining unpaid shall be collected in the same manner as are other personal taxes.</DIV>

The owner and the owner's spouse shall not have received during the last calendar year household income as defined in section 508 of Act No. 281 of the Public Acts of 1967, as amended, being section 206.508 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, in excess of $8,000.00; this amount shall be increased to $10,000.00 for the determination of eligibility for a deferment after December 31, 1982.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The maximum dollar amount of household income required by subsection (1) to be eligible for the deferment of special assessments under this act shall be adjusted each year beginning on January 1, 1984, pursuant to the annual average percentage increase or decrease in the Detroit consumer price index—all items as defined and reported by the United States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   After January 1, 1975, a person 65 years of age or older who otherwise qualifies under this section for deferral of special assessments who fails to pay a prior delinquent special assessment and thereby lost the property to the local unit of government who purchased the property through tax sale may reacquire the property from the local unit of government through a land contract. The land contract for a parcel of property reacquired under the circumstances set forth in this subsection shall be treated as a special assessment for purposes of this act.</DIV>

The department shall cause a lien on the homestead in favor of the state to be recorded with the appropriate register of deeds, indicating the amount of the money paid and identifying the homestead. Money paid from the fund under this subsection shall be treated as if the money had been paid as deferred special assessment.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The department shall pay the entire balance owing, including delinquent amounts, of the special assessment of an applicant who qualifies under this act. The department shall transmit to the collecting officer the sum of money required to indemnify the local special assessment district for a revenue loss resulting from the deferment of the special assessment. At the same time, the department shall cause the recording of a lien in favor of the state with the register of deeds and notify the county treasurer of the special assessment deferred, indicating the amount deferred for each special assessment and identifying the homestead. The county treasurer shall keep a record of the notice and shall require that the homestead be included in the subsequent return of delinquent taxes by each collecting officer, that the property is identified on the delinquent roll as provided in this act, and that the amount of special assessment shown on the roll as due and unpaid are the same as the amount approved by the department for deferment. The sum received by the collecting officer from the department shall be distributed to the several special assessment districts in direct proportion to their respective shares of the total of special assessments deferred in the same manner that distribution would be made had the same amount been received from the payment of the special assessments. The collecting officer shall enter on the current tax roll opposite each homestead for which deferment is allowed a notation that payment is deferred pursuant to this act.</DIV>

As used in this section, contiguity is not broken by a road, an easement, a right-of-way, or property occupied by power transmission lines or buffer zones. Mineral-producing property also includes all the following within this state:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Mineral rights in mineral-producing property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Mineral leases, options, and mining rights on or in mineral-producing property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Mineral stockpiles and mineral inventories that are owned, leased, or controlled by a taxpayer.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Buffer lands that are owned, leased, or controlled by a taxpayer and are appurtenant to mineral-producing property. For purposes of determining appurtenance to mineral-producing property for buffer lands owned, leased, or controlled by a taxpayer, there is a rebuttable presumption that all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) Land that is no more than 1/4 mile from nonbuffer land mineral-producing property, is held by the taxpayer for use as buffer land.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) Land that is more than 1/4 mile from nonbuffer land mineral-producing property and that a taxpayer is required to own, lease, or control due to requirements imposed by federal, state, or local law, is held by the taxpayer for use as buffer land.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) Buildings, improvements, fixtures, and nonmobile equipment located upon, beneath, or appurtenant to a mine, including administrative and support facilities appurtenant to a mine provided that such property is located upon, beneath, or on a parcel that is a mineral-producing property.</div>

There is a rebuttable presumption that the purchase price of a taxable mineral under a bona fide arm's-length contract of sale or transfer between unrelated persons reflects the taxable mineral value. In determining the taxable mineral value of a taxable mineral for contracts of sale or transfer between related persons, there is a rebuttable presumption that taxable mineral value for related party sales or transfers shall be based on the average daily price of the mineral as quoted on published market indices as of the date of sale or transfer. The taxable mineral value of taxable minerals sold or transferred by a taxpayer following beneficiation shall reflect the total value of the taxable mineral in its beneficiated state. For taxable minerals which are to be shipped or transported outside this state for beneficiation outside this state or otherwise removed by a taxpayer from this state and which are considered to have been sold as provided in section 4(1), the taxable mineral value shall reflect the total value of the minerals immediately prior to the shipment or removal based on the average daily price of the mineral as quoted on published market indices as determined by the department.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The department shall allocate the minerals severance tax and the local tax collecting unit shall collect the minerals severance tax as provided in this act and collect the same collection charges as general property taxes under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Beginning in 1994 through 2002, the tax levied under this act shall be collected and distributed by the local tax collecting unit under the provisions of the general property tax act at the same time as other taxes levied by the local school district for school operating purposes. However, in each year after 1993 if a local school district is not going to levy a tax in that summer but levied a tax in the summer of 1993, and the local tax collecting unit in which the local school district is located is collecting a tax for any taxing unit in that summer, the local tax collecting unit shall collect within that local school district 1/2 of the tax under this act in that summer. The tax levied under this act that is collected by a city shall become a lien against the property on which assessed in the same manner and on the same date as city taxes or, if the city approves the collection of the tax levied under this act on a date other than the date it collects the city taxes, on July 1. The tax levied under this act that is collected with the city taxes shall be subject to the same penalties, interest, and collection charges as city taxes and, except as otherwise provided in subsection (3), shall be returned as delinquent to the county treasurer in the same manner and with the same interest, penalties, and fees as city taxes, except as provided in section 89a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.89a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Beginning in 2003, the tax levied under this act shall be collected under the provisions of the general property tax act in a summer levy and shall be distributed as provided in this act. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) and section 5b, the tax levied under this act shall be collected by each city and township.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Notwithstanding the provision of a charter of a county adopted pursuant to 1966 PA 293, MCL 45.501 to 45.521, or the provisions of the charter of a home rule city, to the contrary, the city treasurer of a city that does not return delinquent real property taxes levied by the city to the county treasurer shall return all uncollected delinquent taxes levied under this act to the county treasurer as provided by the general property tax act, on the March 1 immediately following the year in which the taxes are levied. After the delinquent real property taxes are returned to the county treasurer for collection under this section, the provisions of the general property tax act apply for the collection of those taxes and for the issuance of notes in anticipation of the collection of the taxes.</div>

Upon request by the local tax collecting unit, if the local tax collecting unit collects the tax levied under this act, or by the school district or intermediate school district, if the school district or intermediate school district collects the tax levied under this act, the state treasurer shall return to the local tax collecting unit or to the school district or intermediate school district an amount erroneously collected or an amount required to be returned by court order in a bankruptcy proceeding filed after December 31, 1999.</div>

The tax levied under this act that is collected pursuant to this section on or before September 14 of each year by a city that collects school taxes on a date other than the date it collects city taxes shall be without interest, but the tax levied under this act that is collected after September 14 in each year shall bear interest at the rate imposed by section 59 of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.59, on delinquent property tax levies that become a lien in the same year.

</P>
<P>Sec. 3.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Beginning January 1, 2001, the agricultural property recapture tax provided under section 4 is imposed as provided in this section if the property meets all of the following conditions:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The property was transferred after December 31, 1999.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The taxable value of the property was not adjusted under section 27a(3) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.27a, after the transfer described in subdivision (a) due to the provisions of section 27a(7)(n) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.27a.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The property is converted by a change in use after December 31, 2000.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a recapture tax is imposed because qualified agricultural property is converted by a change in use described under section 2(c)(i), the recapture tax is the obligation of the person who owned the property at the time the property was converted by a change in use. If a recapture tax is imposed on the owner of the property under this subsection, the recapture tax is a lien on the property subject to the recapture tax until paid. If the recapture tax is not paid within 90 days of the date the property was converted by a change in use, the treasurer may bring a civil action against the owner of the property as of the date the property was converted by a change in use. If the recapture tax remains unpaid on the March 1 in the year immediately succeeding the year in which the property is converted by a change in use, the property on which the recapture tax is due shall be returned as delinquent to the county treasurer of the county in which the property is located.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in section 5a, there is levied upon every owner of eligible tax reverted property a specific tax to be known as the eligible tax reverted property specific tax.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The amount of the eligible tax reverted property specific tax in each year is the amount of tax that would have been collected on that parcel under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, if that parcel was not exempt under section 3. An owner of eligible tax reverted property that is a principal residence may claim an exemption for that portion of the specific tax attributable to the tax levied by a local school district for school operating purposes to the extent provided under section 1211 of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1211, if an owner of that eligible tax reverted property claims or has claimed an exemption for the property as provided in section 7cc of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7cc.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The eligible tax reverted property specific tax shall be assessed, collected, and disbursed in accordance with this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The eligible tax reverted property specific tax is an annual tax, payable at the same times, in the same installments, and to the same officer or officers as taxes imposed under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, and the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, are payable. The eligible tax reverted property specific tax is subject to the same collection fee and interest as taxes imposed under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the officer or officers shall disburse the eligible tax reverted property specific tax payments received by the officer or officers each year as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Fifty percent of the eligible tax reverted property specific tax to and among this state and cities, townships, villages, school districts, counties, or other taxing units, at the same times and in the same proportions as required by law for the disbursement of taxes collected under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155.</div>

The eligible tax reverted property specific tax disbursed under this subdivision shall only be used by the authority for 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) For the purposes authorized under the land bank fast track act, 2003 PA 258, MCL 124.751 to 124.774, including, but not limited to, costs to clear, quiet, or defend title to property held by the authority.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The amount of eligible tax reverted property specific tax described in subsection (2) that would otherwise be disbursed to a local school district for school operating purposes shall be paid instead to the state treasury and credited to the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The officer or officers shall send a copy of the amount of disbursement made to each unit under this section to the commission on a form provided by the commission.</div>

The eligible tax reverted property specific tax calculated under this subsection shall be disbursed proportionately to the taxing unit or units that levied the tax described in section 7ff(2) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7ff.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The eligible tax reverted property specific tax levied under this section becomes a lien on the eligible tax reverted property assessed on the same date that a tax becomes a lien on real property under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155. A lien for the eligible tax reverted property specific tax includes any applicable collection fee or interest. A lien under this subsection continues until paid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If the county treasurer consents, any unpaid eligible tax reverted property specific tax and any applicable collection fee or interest shall be returned as delinquent to the county treasurer at the same time taxes are returned as delinquent under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, eligible tax reverted property subject to an eligible tax reverted property specific tax returned as delinquent is subject to forfeiture, foreclosure, and sale at the same time and in the same manner as property subject to delinquent taxes under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155. If an eligible tax reverted property specific tax or any applicable collection fee or interest for an eligible tax reverted property has not been paid for 2 or more years on the date the eligible tax reverted property is returned as delinquent under this subsection, the eligible tax reverted property shall be forfeited to the county treasurer upon its return and is subject to foreclosure and sale at the same time and in the same manner as other property forfeited under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) "Acquisition cost" means the fair market value of personal property at the time of acquisition by the first owner, including the cost of freight, sales tax, and installation, and other capitalized costs, except capitalized interest. There is a rebuttable presumption that the acquisition price paid by the first owner for personal property, and any costs of freight, sales tax, and installation, and other capitalized costs, except capitalized interest, reflect the acquisition cost.

The department may provide guidelines for circumstances in which the actual acquisition price is not determinative of acquisition cost and the basis of determining acquisition cost in those circumstances. When the acquisition cost, year of acquisition by the first owner, or both are unknown, the department may provide guidelines for estimating the acquisition cost and year of acquisition by the first owner. The department may issue guidelines that allow for the reduction of acquisition cost for property that is idle, is obsolete or has material obsolescence, or is surplus.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) "Acquisition cost" means the fair market value of personal property at the time of acquisition by the first owner, including the cost of freight, sales tax, and installation, and other capitalized costs, except capitalized interest. There is a rebuttable presumption that the acquisition price paid by the first owner for personal property, and any costs of freight, sales tax, and installation, and other capitalized costs, except capitalized interest, reflect the acquisition cost. For personal property exempt under section 9m or 9n of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.9m and 211.9n, that prior to the current tax year was exempt under section 7k of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7k, under an industrial facilities exemption certificate issued under 1974 PA 198, MCL 207.551 to 207.572, and effective before January 1, 2013, which either has been extended for property not yet exempt under section 9m or 9n of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.9m and 211.9n, or had an expiration date after the date the tax levied under this act is due, and for personal property subject to an extended industrial facilities exemption certificate under section 11a of 1974 PA 198, MCL 207.561a, that is exempt under an industrial facilities exemption certificate issued under 1974 PA 198, MCL 207.551 to 207.572, and effective before January 1, 2013, acquisition cost means 1/2 of the fair market value of that personal property at the time of acquisition by the first owner, including the cost of freight, sales tax, and installation, and other capitalized costs, except capitalized interest. The acquisition cost for personal property exempt under the Michigan renaissance zone act, 1996 PA 376, MCL 125.2681 to 125.2696, is $0.00 except for the 3 years immediately preceding the expiration of the exemption of that personal property under the Michigan renaissance zone act, 1996 PA 376, MCL 125.2681 to 125.2696, during which period of time the acquisition cost for that personal property means the fair market value of that personal property at the time of acquisition by the first owner, including the cost of freight, sales tax, and installation, and other capitalized costs, except capitalized interest, multiplied by the percentage reduction in the exemption as provided in section 9(3) of the Michigan renaissance zone act, 1996 PA 376, MCL 125.2689. The department may provide guidelines for circumstances in which the actual acquisition price is not determinative of acquisition cost and the basis of determining acquisition cost in those circumstances. When the acquisition cost, year of acquisition by the first owner, or both are unknown, the department may provide guidelines for estimating the acquisition cost and year of acquisition by the first owner. The department may issue guidelines that allow for the reduction of acquisition cost for property that is idle, is obsolete or has material obsolescence, or is surplus.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Beginning with the 2017 assessment year, for property that is construction in progress only, "acquisition cost" means 1/2 of the fair market value at the time acquired by the first owner, including the cost of freight, sales tax, and installation. For property that is construction in progress, "acquired by" means the year the property is first reported on the combined form as prescribed in section 7(8) in the report of the fair market value and year of acquisition by the first owner of qualified new personal property or qualified previously existing personal property.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) There is levied upon the owner of each parcel or transitional qualified forest property a specific tax to be known as the transitional qualified forest property specific tax.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The amount of the transitional qualified forest property specific tax in each year shall be the greater of an amount equal to the specific tax calculated under section 51106 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.51106, for that property or an amount determined as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Multiply the number of mills that would be assessed in the local tax collecting unit if the property were subject to the collection of taxes under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, and if the property was exempt as provided under section 7jj of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7jj[1], by the transitional qualified forest property's taxable value.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If a new millage is approved in the local tax collecting unit in which transitional qualified forest property is located after the effective date of this act, multiply the number of mills that were approved that would be assessed if the transitional qualified forest property were subject to the collection of taxes under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, by the transitional qualified forest property's taxable value.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Add the result of the calculation under subdivision (b) and the result of all calculations under subdivision (c).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Beginning in the year that transitional qualified forest property is subject to tax under this act and each year thereafter, a fee is imposed on each parcel of transitional qualified forest property under this act. The fee shall be calculated in the same manner, collected at the same time and in the same manner, and disbursed in the same manner as the fee provided for under section 7jj(9) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7jj[1].</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Not more than 90 days after all or a portion of the exempted property is no longer transitional qualified forest property, the owner shall rescind the exemption for the applicable portion of the property by filing with the register of deeds for the county in which the exempted property is located a rescission form prescribed by the department. A copy of the rescission form shall be provided to the assessor. The rescission form shall include a legal description of the property. An owner who fails to file a rescission form as required by this subsection is subject to a penalty of $5.00 per day for each separate failure beginning after the 90 days have elapsed, up to a maximum of $1,000.00. This penalty shall be collected under 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.1 to 205.31, and shall be deposited in the private forestland enhancement fund created in section 51305 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.51305.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The qualified heavy equipment rental personal property exemption reimbursement fund is created within the state treasury. All proceeds from the qualified heavy equipment rental personal property specific tax levied under this act are dedicated to this fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The state treasurer shall direct the investment of the fund. The state treasurer shall credit to the fund interest and earnings from fund investments. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Money in the fund at the close of the fiscal year must remain in the fund and not lapse to the general fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The department is the administrator of the fund for auditing purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The department shall distribute money from the fund, upon appropriation, only for the following purposes and in the following order of priority:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Starting for fiscal year 2022-2023, to the department, for administrative costs associated with administering this act, an amount equal to $400,000.00. For each fiscal year after fiscal year 2022-2023, to the department, for administrative costs associated with administering this act, an amount equal to the amount allowed under this subdivision in the prior fiscal year increased for inflation, as measured by the ratio of the average published monthly Detroit Consumer Price Index values for the previous fiscal year to the published monthly Detroit Consumer Price Index values for the fiscal year prior to the previous fiscal year, minus 1.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) After the distribution in subdivision (a), distribute the remaining balance as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) By September 30, 2023, and each September 30 thereafter, distribute 90% of the revenues deposited into the fund in the preceding January through June, less any amount distributed under subdivision (a) during the preceding January through June, to eligible local tax collecting units. By March 31, 2024, and each March 31 thereafter, distribute 90% of the revenues deposited into the fund in the preceding July through December, less any amount distributed under subdivision (a) during the preceding July through December, to eligible local tax collecting units. The distribution under this subparagraph must be allocated to each eligible local tax collecting unit based on the proportion that the total tax collected in the 2 immediately preceding quarterly reporting periods from each qualified renter business location in the eligible local tax collecting unit bears to the total tax collected in the 2 immediately preceding quarterly reporting periods from all qualified renter business locations. At the time the department makes distributions under this subparagraph, the department shall provide each eligible local tax collecting unit information regarding the amount of tax collected in the 2 immediately preceding quarterly reporting periods from each qualified renter business location in the eligible local tax collecting unit. Within 35 days after an eligible local tax collecting unit receives an allocation under this subparagraph, the eligible local tax collecting unit shall, subject to sub-subparagraph (D), distribute its allocation to the taxing units in accordance with sub-subparagraphs (A) to (C), as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) For each qualified renter business location in the eligible local tax collecting unit, apportion the allocation received by the eligible local tax collecting unit by multiplying the allocation received by the eligible local tax collecting unit by a fraction, the numerator of which is the tax levied under this act and paid from the qualified renter business location in the eligible local tax collecting unit and the denominator of which is the total tax levied under this act and paid from all qualified renter business locations in the eligible local tax collecting unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) For each taxing unit that levied millage at the qualified renter business location in the eligible local tax collecting unit, multiply the amount calculated under sub-subparagraph (A) for the associated qualified renter business location by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the millage rates levied on commercial personal property for the associated taxing unit in the prior calendar year and the denominator of which is the total of all millage rates levied on commercial personal property by all taxing units that levied millage at the qualified renter business location in the prior calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(C) For each taxing unit that levied millage at a qualified renter business location in the eligible local tax collecting unit, distribute to the taxing unit the sum of all amounts calculated under sub-subparagraph (B) for that taxing unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(D) The amount that would otherwise be disbursed under this subsection to a local school district for school operating purposes must be paid instead to the state treasury and credited to the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963. Of the amount that would otherwise be disbursed under this subsection to an intermediate school district receiving state aid under section 56 or 62 of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1656 and 388.1662, all or a portion, to be determined on the basis of the tax rates being utilized to compute the amount of state aid, must be paid to the state treasury to the credit of the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(E) As used in this subparagraph, "eligible local tax collecting unit" means a local tax collecting unit in which is located a qualified renter business location that was reported under section 7(3) for the 2 immediately preceding quarterly reporting periods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) By July 31, 2024, and each July 31 thereafter, distribute 10% of the revenues deposited into the fund in the previous calendar year, less any amount distributed under subdivision (a) during the previous calendar year, to those cities, villages, townships, and counties that do not directly or indirectly receive money distributed under subparagraph (i). The distribution under this subparagraph must be allocated to each city, village, township, or county, that does not directly or indirectly receive money distributed under subparagraph (i), based on the proportion that its distribution of local community stabilization share revenue, for the calendar year in question, under section 17(4)(a)(i) to (vi) and 17(4)(b) to (e) of the local community stabilization authority act, 2014 PA 86, MCL 123.1357, bears to the total amount of local community stabilization share revenue distributed, for the calendar year in question, under section 17(4)(a)(i) to (vi) and 17(4)(b) to (e) of the local community stabilization authority act, 2014 PA 86, MCL 123.1357, to all cities, villages, townships, and counties not directly or indirectly receiving money distributed under subparagraph (i).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The legislative body of the qualified local governmental unit, not more than 120 days after receipt of the application by the clerk, shall by resolution either approve or disapprove the application for a certificate in accordance with all provisions of this act. The clerk shall retain the original of the application and resolution. If approved, the clerk shall forward a copy of the application, the resolution, and the assessed and taxable value estimate referenced in section 4(4) to the commission within 60 days after approval or before September 30 of the year, whichever is first, in order for the applicant to be able to receive the certificate for the following year. If the application is determined to be incomplete, the clerk shall notify the applicant in writing within 60 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The 120-day period is reset and tolled upon notification by the clerk of a deficiency until all of the information requested in writing by the clerk is received by the qualified local governmental unit. The applicant has 60 days to correct the deficiency, or the application is void unless the applicant and the qualified local governmental unit agree in writing to an extension of this period not to exceed an additional 30 days. The extension agreement must be completed in a form and manner prescribed by the commission. The determination of the completeness of an application is not an approval of the application. If the application is disapproved, the reasons must be set forth in writing in the resolution, and the clerk shall send, by certified mail, a copy of the resolution to the applicant, the assessor, and the commission. A resolution approving the application is not effective unless approved by the commission as provided in section 6.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Within 14 days after the adoption of a resolution disapproving the application under subsection (1), the owner or lessee may request the legislative body of the qualified local governmental unit to reconsider the application by submitting information not previously included in the application submitted under section 4. Within 60 days after receipt of the request for reconsideration, the legislative body of the qualified local governmental unit shall review the new information and by resolution either approve or disapprove the request for reconsideration in accordance with subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The actions by a qualified local governmental unit to either approve or disapprove an application for a certificate within this act are discretionary and are for solar energy facilities tax purposes only.</div>
