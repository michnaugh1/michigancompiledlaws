If the psychiatric hospital or psychiatric unit is located on or in real estate that is leased, the applicant or licensee shall disclose the name of the lessor and any direct or indirect interest that the applicant or licensee has in the lease other than as lessee. A license shall be granted for no longer than 1 year after the date of issuance, unless otherwise provided in sections 134 to 150. The director may issue a provisional license for 1 year to provide a licensee or applicant time to undertake remedial action to correct programmatic or physical plant deficiencies. A provisional license may be renewed for not longer than 1 additional year. A violation of this section is a misdemeanor and is punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 for each violation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Annual licensure of psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units shall be implemented by March 28, 1997. License fees shall be prorated according to the period of time that the license will be in force.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The department shall issue an initial license under this section not later than 6 months after the applicant files a completed application. Receipt of the application is considered the date the application is received by any agency or department of this state. If the application is considered incomplete by the department, the department shall notify the applicant in writing or make notice electronically available within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting additional information. The 6-month period is tolled upon notification by the department of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the department. The determination of the completeness of an application is not an approval of the application for the license and does not confer eligibility on an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the department fails to issue or deny a license or registration within the time required by this section, the department shall return the license fee and shall reduce the license fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. Failure to issue or deny a license within the time period required under this section does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of the application. A completed application shall be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based on the fact that the application fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The director of the department shall submit a report by December 1 of each year to the standing committees and appropriations subcommittees of the senate and house of representatives concerned with issues relating to mental health. The director shall include all of the following information in the report concerning the preceding fiscal year:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The number of initial applications the department received and completed within the 6-month time period described in subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The number of applications rejected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The number of applicants not issued a license within the 6-month time period and the amount of money returned to licensees under subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) As used in this section, "completed application" means an application complete on its face and submitted with any applicable licensing fees as well as any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of this state.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Avoiding concentration of PRTFs in any particular community or area of this state to ensure the easiest possible access for families or guardians to visit patients when appropriate.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The capacity of a PRTF to provide care that results in the successful integration of patients back into the community within 60 to 120 days after admission to the PRTF, including a reintegration with family whenever possible and appropriate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The department shall evaluate each selected PRTF no less than every 2 years based on the criteria developed by the department, including the criteria described in subsection (4)(a) and (b). The department may revoke the selection and certification of, or take corrective action considered necessary against, any PRTF that is determined to no longer be needed or appropriate under the criteria described in subsection (4)(a) or found not to be in compliance with the criteria described in subsection (4)(b). This subsection does not limit the ability of the department to take corrective action or to revoke the selection or certification of a PRTF for other good cause at any time.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A county community mental health agency or a community mental health organization that is certified by the department under section 232a may become a community mental health authority as provided in this section through an enabling resolution adopted by the board of commissioners of each creating county after at least 3 public hearings held in accordance with the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275. The resolution is considered adopted if it is approved by a majority of the commissioners elected and serving in each county creating the authority. The enabling resolution is not effective until it has been filed with the secretary of state and with the county clerk of each county creating the authority. If any provision of the enabling resolution conflicts with this act, this act supersedes the conflicting provision.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   All of the following shall be stated in the enabling resolution:</DIV>

These provisions shall comply with section 220.</DIV>

All other remaining assets, net of liabilities, shall be transferred to the community mental health services program or programs that replace the authority.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The liability of the community mental health authority for costs associated with real or personal property purchased or leased by the county for use by the community mental health services program to the extent necessary to discharge the financial liability if desired by the county or counties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The manner of employing, compensating, transferring, or discharging necessary personnel subject to the provisions of applicable civil service and merit systems, and the following restrictions:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Employees of a community mental health authority are public employees. A community mental health authority and its employees are subject to 1947 PA 336, MCL 423.201 to 423.217.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Upon the creation of a community mental health authority, the employees of the former community mental health services program shall be transferred to the new authority and appointed as employees subject to all rights and benefits for 1 year. Such employees of the new community mental health authority shall not be placed in a worse position by reason of the transfer for a period of 1 year with respect to workers' compensation, pension, seniority, wages, sick leave, vacation, health and welfare insurance, or any other benefit that the employee enjoyed as an employee of the former community mental health services program. Employees who are transferred shall not by reason of the transfer have their accrued pension benefits or credits diminished.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   If the former county community mental health agency or community mental health organization was the designated employer or participated in the development of a collective bargaining agreement, the newly established community mental health authority shall assume and be bound by the existing collective bargaining agreement. The formation of a community mental health authority shall not adversely affect any existing rights and obligations contained in the existing collective bargaining agreement. For purposes of this provision, participation in the development of a collective bargaining agreement means that a representative of the community mental health agency or organization actively participated in bargaining sessions with the employer representative and union or was consulted with during the bargaining process.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Any other matter consistent with this act that is necessary to assure operation of the community mental health authority as agreed upon by the creating county or counties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a county community mental health agency or a community mental health organization becomes a community mental health authority pursuant to this section, both of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   All assets, debts, and obligations of the county community mental health agency or community mental health organization, including, but not limited to, equipment, furnishings, supplies, cash, and other personal property, shall be transferred to the community mental health authority.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   All the privileges and immunities from liability and exemptions from laws, ordinances, and rules that are applicable to county community mental health agencies or community mental health organizations and their board members, officers, and administrators, and county elected officials and employees of county government are retained by the authority and the board members, officers, agents, and employees of an authority created under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In addition to other powers of a community mental health services program as set forth in this act, a community mental health authority has all of the following powers, whether or not they are specified in the enabling resolution:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   To fix and collect charges, rates, rents, fees, or other charges and to collect interest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   To make purchases and contracts.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   To transfer, divide, or distribute assets, liabilities, or contingent liabilities, unless the community mental health authority is a single-county community mental health services program and the county has notified the department of its intention to terminate participation in the community mental health services program.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A community mental health services program may do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Establish demonstration projects allowing the executive director to do 1 or both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Issue a voucher to a recipient in accordance with the recipient's plan of services developed by the community mental health services program.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to section 114a, the department shall promulgate rules to establish standards for certification and the certification review process for community mental health services programs. The standards shall include but not be limited to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Matters of governance, resource management, quality improvement, service delivery, and safety management.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Promotion and protection of recipient rights.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) After reviewing a community mental health services program, the department shall notify a program that substantially complies with the standards established under this section that it is certified by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The department may waive the certification review process in whole or in part and consider the community mental health services program to be in substantial compliance with the standards established under this section if the program has received accreditation from a national accrediting organization recognized by the department that includes review of matters described in subsection (1)(a).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the department certifies a community mental health services program despite some items of noncompliance with the standards established under this section, the notice of certification shall identify the items of noncompliance and the program shall correct the items of noncompliance. The department shall require the community mental health board to submit a plan to correct items of noncompliance before recertification or sooner at the discretion of the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Certification is effective for 3 years and is not transferable. Requests for recertification shall be submitted to the department at least 6 months before the expiration of certification. Certification remains in effect after the submission of a renewal request until the department conducts a review and makes a redetermination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The department shall conduct an annual review of each community mental health services program's recipient rights system to ensure compliance with standards established under subsection (1)(b). An on-site review shall be conducted once every 3 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The community mental health services program shall promptly notify the department of any changes that may affect continued certification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The department may deny certification if the community mental health services program cannot demonstrate substantial compliance with the standards established under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) In lieu of denying certification, the department may issue a provisional certification for a period of up to 6 months upon receiving a plan of correction submitted by the community mental health services board. The department shall provide a copy of the review and the approved plan of correction to the board of commissioners of each county that established the county community mental health agency or created the community mental health organization or community mental health authority. A provisional certification may be extended, but the entire provisional period shall not exceed 1 year. The department shall conduct an on-site review to determine the community mental health services program's compliance with the plan of correction at least 30 days before the expiration of the provisional certification. A provisional certification automatically expires either on its original expiration date or the expiration date of the extension granted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If a community mental health services program is denied certification, fails to comply with an approved plan of correction before the expiration of a provisional certification, or fails to comply substantially with the standards established under this section, the department shall notify the community mental health services board and the board of commissioners of each county that established the agency or created the organization or authority of the department's intention to suspend, deny, or revoke certification. The notice shall be sent by certified mail and shall set forth the particular reasons for the proposed action and offer an opportunity for a hearing with the director of the department's division that manages contracts with community mental health services programs. If it desires a hearing, the community mental health services board shall request it in writing within 60 days after receipt of the notice. The department shall hold the hearing not less than 30 days or more than 60 days from the date it receives the request for a hearing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The director of the department's division that manages contracts with community mental health services programs shall make a decision regarding suspension, denial, or revocation of certification based on evidence presented at the hearing or on the default of the community mental health services board. A copy of the decision shall be sent by certified mail within 45 days after the close of the hearing to the community mental health services board and to the board of commissioners of each county that established the agency or created the organization or authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A community mental health services board may appeal a decision made under subsection (11) as provided in chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.271 to 24.287.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) During the period of certification, the department may conduct an unannounced review of a certified community mental health services program.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An individual who appears to be incapacitated in a public place shall be taken into protective custody by a peace officer and taken to an approved service program or to an emergency medical service, or to a transfer facility according to subsection (4) for subsequent transportation to an approved service program or emergency medical service. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if requested by a peace officer, an emergency service unit or staff shall provide transportation for the individual to an approved service program or an emergency medical service. This subsection does not apply to the transportation of an individual by an emergency service unit or staff if the peace officer reasonably believes that the individual will attempt escape or will be unreasonably difficult for staff to control.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A peace officer may take an individual into protective custody with that kind and degree of force that is lawful for the officer to arrest that individual for a misdemeanor without a warrant. In taking the individual, a peace officer may take reasonable steps to protect himself or herself. The protective steps may include a pat-down search of the individual in his or her immediate surroundings, but only to the extent necessary to discover and seize any dangerous weapon that may on that occasion be used against the officer or other individuals present. The peace officer shall take these protective steps before an emergency service unit or staff provides transportation of an individual to an approved service program or emergency medical service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The taking of an individual to an approved service program, emergency medical service, or transfer facility under subsection (1) is not an arrest, but is a taking into protective custody with or without consent of the individual. The peace officer shall inform the individual that he or she is being held in protective custody and is not under arrest. An entry or other record shall not be made to indicate that the individual was arrested or charged with either a crime or being incapacitated. An entry shall be made indicating the date, time, and place of the taking, but the entry shall not be treated for any purpose as an arrest or criminal record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An individual taken into protective custody under subsection (1) may be taken to a transfer facility for not more than 8 hours, if an approved service program or an emergency medical service is not located in that county and if, due to distance or other circumstances, a peace officer is unable to complete transport of the individual to an approved service program or emergency medical service. The peace officer or agency shall immediately notify and request the nearest approved service program or emergency medical service to provide an emergency service unit or staff as soon as possible to transport the individual to that approved service program or emergency medical service. If an emergency service unit or staff is not available for transportation, a peace officer may transport the individual to an approved service program or emergency medical service. If an emergency service unit or staff is to provide transportation, the designated representative of the transfer facility shall assume custody of the individual and shall take all reasonable steps to ensure the individual's health and safety until custody is transferred to the emergency service unit or staff of an approved service program or emergency medical service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An individual arrested by a peace officer for the commission of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 3 months, or by a fine of not more than $500.00, or both, may be taken to an approved service program or an emergency medical service for emergency treatment if the individual appears to be incapacitated at the time of arrest. This treatment is not in lieu of criminal prosecution of the individual for the offense with which the individual is charged and it does not preclude the administration of any tests as provided for by law.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Each community mental health services program must establish 1 or more preadmission screening units with 24-hour availability to provide assessment and screening services for individuals being considered for admission into hospitals, assisted outpatient treatment programs, or crisis services on a voluntary basis. The community mental health services program shall employ mental health professionals or licensed bachelor's social workers licensed under part 185 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.18501 to 333.18518, to provide the preadmission screening services or contract with another agency that meets the requirements of this section. Preadmission screening unit staff shall be supervised by a registered professional nurse or other mental health professional possessing at least a master's degree.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Each community mental health services program shall provide the address and telephone number of its preadmission screening unit or units to law enforcement agencies, the department, the court, hospital emergency rooms, and private security companies under contract with a county under section 170.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A preadmission screening unit shall assess an individual being considered for admission into a hospital operated by the department or under contract with the community mental health services program. If the individual is clinically suitable for hospitalization, the preadmission screening unit shall authorize voluntary admission to the hospital.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the preadmission screening unit of the community mental health services program denies hospitalization, the individual or the person making the application may request a second opinion from the executive director. The executive director shall arrange for an additional evaluation by a psychiatrist, other physician, or licensed psychologist to be performed within 3 days, excluding Sundays and legal holidays, after the executive director receives the request. If the conclusion of the second opinion is different from the conclusion of the preadmission screening unit, the executive director, in conjunction with the medical director, shall make a decision based on all clinical information available. The executive director's decision shall be confirmed in writing to the individual who requested the second opinion, and the confirming document shall include the signatures of the executive director and medical director or verification that the decision was made in conjunction with the medical director. If an individual is assessed and found not to be clinically suitable for hospitalization, the preadmission screening unit shall provide appropriate referral services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If an individual is assessed and found not to be clinically suitable for hospitalization, the preadmission screening unit shall provide information regarding alternative services and the availability of those services, and make appropriate referrals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A preadmission screening unit shall assess and examine, or refer to a hospital for examination, an individual who is brought to the preadmission screening unit by a peace officer or security transport officer or ordered by a court to be examined. If the individual meets the requirements for hospitalization, the preadmission screening unit shall designate the hospital to which the individual shall be admitted. The preadmission screening unit shall consult with the individual and, if the individual agrees, the preadmission screening unit must consult with the individual's family member of choice, if available, as to the preferred hospital for admission of the individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A preadmission screening unit may operate a crisis stabilization unit under chapter 9A. A preadmission screening unit may provide crisis services to an individual, who by assessment and screening, is found to be a person requiring treatment. Crisis services at a crisis stabilization unit must entail an initial psychosocial assessment by a master's level mental health professional and a psychiatric evaluation within 24 hours to stabilize the individual. In this event, crisis services may be provided for a period of up to 72 hours, after which the individual must be provided with the clinically appropriate level of care, resulting in 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The individual is no longer a person requiring treatment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A referral to outpatient services for aftercare treatment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A referral to a partial hospitalization program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A referral to a residential treatment center, including crisis residential services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A referral to an inpatient bed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) An order for involuntary treatment of the individual has been issued under section 281b, 281c, former 433, or 434.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A preadmission screening unit operating a crisis stabilization unit under chapter 9A may also offer crisis services to an individual who is not a person requiring treatment, but who is seeking crisis services on a voluntary basis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the individual chooses a hospital not under contract with a community mental health services program, and the hospital agrees to the admission, the preadmission screening unit shall refer the individual to the hospital that is requested by the individual. Any financial obligation for the services provided by the hospital shall be satisfied from funding sources other than the community mental health services program, the department, or other state or county funding.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a peace officer is taking an individual into protective custody, the peace officer may use that kind and degree of force that would be lawful if the peace officer were effecting an arrest for a misdemeanor without a warrant. In taking an individual into custody, a peace officer may take reasonable steps for self-protection. In transporting an individual, a security transport officer may take reasonable steps for self-protection. The protective steps may include a pat down search of the individual in the individual's immediate surroundings, but only to the extent necessary to discover and seize a dangerous weapon that may be used against the peace officer, security transport officer, or other individual present. These protective steps must be taken by the peace officer or security transport officer before the individual is transported to a preadmission screening unit or a hospital designated by the community mental health services program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Taking an individual to a community mental health services program's preadmission screening unit or a hospital under section 427 by a peace officer is not an arrest, but is a taking into protective custody. The peace officer must inform the individual that he or she is being held in protective custody and is not under arrest. An entry must be made indicating the date, time, and place of the taking, but the entry must not be treated for any purpose as an arrest or criminal record.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The subject of a petition has the right to be present at all hearings. This right may be waived by a waiver of attendance signed by the subject of a petition, witnessed by his or her legal counsel, and filed with the court or it may be waived in open court at a scheduled hearing. The subject's right to be present at a hearing is considered waived by the subject's failure to attend the hearing after receiving notice required by section 453 and any applicable court rule, providing the subject has had an opportunity to consult with counsel as required under section 454. The court may exclude the subject from a hearing if the subject's behavior at the hearing makes it impossible to conduct the hearing. The court shall enter on the record its reasons for excluding the subject of a petition from the hearing. The subject's presence may be waived by the court if there is testimony by a physician or licensed psychologist who has recently observed the subject that the subject's attendance would expose him or her to serious risk of physical harm.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The subject of the petition under section 434, after consultation with counsel, may stipulate to the entry of any order for treatment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The subject of a petition under section 434 who is hospitalized pending the court hearing, within 72 hours after the petition and clinical certificates have been filed with the court, shall meet with legal counsel, a treatment team member assigned by the hospital director, a person assigned by the executive director of the responsible community mental health services program or other program as designated by the department, and, if possible, a person designated by the subject of the petition, in order to be informed of all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The proposed plan of treatment in the hospital.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The nature and possible consequences of commitment procedures.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The proposed plan of treatment in the community consisting of either an alternative to hospitalization or a combination of hospitalization and assisted outpatient treatment with hospitalization not to exceed 60 days.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The right to request that the hearing be temporarily deferred, with a continuing right to demand a hearing during the deferral period. The deferral period shall be 60 days if the individual chooses to remain hospitalized, or 180 days if the individual chooses outpatient treatment or a combination of hospitalization and outpatient treatment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The person designated by the subject of the petition under subsection (3) may be any person who is willing and able to attend the meeting, including a representative of an advocacy group or the recipient rights adviser of the hospital.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The hospital in which the subject of a petition under section 434 is hospitalized shall notify the participants of the meeting required by subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The subject of a petition under section 434 may file with the court a request to temporarily defer the hearing for not longer than 60 days if the individual chooses to remain hospitalized, or 180 days if the individual chooses outpatient treatment or a combination of hospitalization and outpatient treatment. The request shall include a stipulation that the individual agrees to remain hospitalized and to accept treatment as may be prescribed for the deferral period, to accept and follow the proposed plan of treatment as described in subsection (3)(c) for the deferral period, or to accept and follow the proposed plan for outpatient treatment, and further agrees that at any time the individual may refuse treatment and demand a hearing under section 452. The request to temporarily defer the hearing shall be on a form provided by the department and signed by the individual in the presence of his or her legal counsel and shall be filed with the court by legal counsel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Upon receipt of the request and stipulation under subsection (6), the court shall temporarily defer the hearing. During the deferral period, both the original petition and the clinical certificates remain valid. If the hearing is convened, the court may require additional clinical certificates and information from the provider. The court shall retain continuing jurisdiction during the deferral period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Upon receipt of a copy of the request to temporarily defer the hearing under subsection (6), if the individual has agreed to remain hospitalized, the hospital director shall treat the individual as a formal voluntary patient without requiring the individual to sign formal voluntary admission forms. If the individual, at any time during the period in which the hearing is being deferred, refuses the prescribed treatment or requests a hearing, either in writing or orally, treatment shall cease, the hospitalized individual shall remain hospitalized with the status of the subject of a petition under section 434, and the court shall be notified to convene a hearing under section 452(1)(d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Upon receipt of a copy of the request to temporarily defer the hearing under subsection (6), if the individual has agreed to participate in an alternative to hospitalization in the community, the hospital director shall release the individual from the hospital to the outpatient treatment provider. If the individual, at any time during the deferral period, refuses the prescribed treatment or requests a hearing, either in writing or orally, treatment shall cease and the court shall be notified to convene a hearing under section 452(1)(d). Upon notification, the court shall, if necessary, order a peace officer to transport the individual to the hospital where the individual shall remain until the hearing is convened. The individual shall be given the status of the subject of a petition under section 434.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If the individual has remained hospitalized and if, not earlier than 14 days nor later than 7 days before the expiration of the deferral period, the hospital director believes that the condition of the individual is such that he or she continues to require treatment, and believes that the individual will not agree to sign a formal voluntary admission request or is considered by the hospital not to be suitable for voluntary admission, the hospital director shall notify the court to convene a hearing under section 452(1)(d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If the individual is participating in an alternative to hospitalization in the community as described in subsection (3)(c) and if, not earlier than 14 days nor later than 7 days before the expiration of the deferral period, the executive director of the community mental health services program responsible for the treatment that is an alternative to hospitalization believes that the condition of the individual is such that he or she continues to require treatment, and believes that the individual will not agree to accept treatment voluntarily or is considered by the outpatient treatment program provider not suitable for voluntary treatment, the executive director shall notify the court to convene a hearing under section 452(1)(d).</div>

After reviewing the report, the court shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Determine whether a treatment program that is an alternative to hospitalization or that follows an initial period of hospitalization is adequate to meet the individual's treatment needs and is sufficient to prevent harm that the individual may inflict upon himself or herself or upon others within the near future.</div>

The order shall state the community mental health services program or, if private arrangements have been made for the reimbursement of mental health treatment services in an alternative setting, the name of the mental health agency or professional that is directed to supervise the individual's assisted outpatient treatment program. The order may provide that if an individual refuses to comply with a psychiatrist's order to return to the hospital, a peace officer must take the individual into protective custody. After the individual is taken into protective custody by a peace officer, a peace officer or a security transport officer shall transport the individual to the hospital selected.</div>

If it is determined that emergency admission is necessary, the minor shall be hospitalized or placed in an appropriate alternative program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a minor is assessed by the preadmission screening unit and found not to be clinically suitable for hospitalization, the preadmission screening unit shall inform the individual or individuals requesting hospitalization of the minor of appropriate available alternative services to which a referral should be made and of the process for a request of a second opinion under subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the preadmission screening unit of the community mental health services program denies hospitalization, a minor's parent or guardian may request a second opinion from the executive director. The executive director shall arrange for an additional evaluation by a psychiatrist, other physician, or licensed psychologist to be performed within 3 days, excluding Sundays and legal holidays, after the executive director receives the request. If the conclusion of the second opinion is different from the conclusion of the preadmission screening unit, the executive director, in conjunction with the medical director, shall make a decision based on all clinical information available. The executive director's decision shall be confirmed in writing to the individual who requested the second opinion, and the confirming document shall include the signatures of the executive director and medical director or verification that the decision was made in conjunction with the medical director.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a person in loco parentis makes a request for emergency admission and the minor is admitted to a hospital under this section, the hospital director or the executive director of the community mental health services program immediately shall notify the minor's parent or parents or guardian. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a minor is hospitalized in a hospital that is operated under contract with a community mental health services program, the hospital director shall notify the appropriate executive director within 24 hours after the hospitalization occurs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a peace officer, as a result of personal observation, has reasonable grounds to believe that a minor is a minor requiring treatment and that the minor presents a serious danger to self or others and if after a reasonable effort to locate the minor's parent, guardian, or person in loco parentis, the minor's parent, guardian, or person in loco parentis cannot be located, the peace officer may take the minor into protective custody and transport the minor to the appropriate community mental health preadmission screening unit, if the community mental health services program has a children's diagnostic and treatment service, or to a hospital if it does not have a children's diagnostic and treatment service. After transporting the minor, the peace officer shall execute a written request for emergency hospitalization of the minor stating the reasons, based upon personal observation, that the peace officer believes that emergency hospitalization is necessary. The written request shall include a statement that a reasonable effort was made by the peace officer to locate the minor's parent, guardian, or person in loco parentis. If it is determined that emergency hospitalization of the minor is not necessary, the minor shall be returned to his or her parent, guardian, or person in loco parentis if an additional attempt to locate the parent, guardian, or person in loco parentis is successful. If the minor's parent, guardian, or person in loco parentis cannot be located, the minor shall be turned over to the protective services program of the family independence agency. If it is determined that emergency admission of the minor is necessary, the minor shall be admitted to the appropriate hospital or to an appropriate alternative program. The executive director immediately shall notify the minor's parent, guardian, or person in loco parentis. If the hospital is under contract with the community mental health services program, the hospital director shall notify the appropriate executive director within 24 hours after the hospitalization occurs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An evaluation of a minor admitted to a hospital under this section shall begin immediately after the minor is admitted. The evaluation shall be conducted in the same manner as provided in section 498e. If the minor is not found to be suitable for hospitalization, the minor shall be released into the custody of his or her parent, guardian, or person in loco parentis, and the minor shall be referred to the executive director who shall determine if the minor needs mental health services. If it is determined that the minor needs mental health services, the executive director shall offer an appropriate treatment program for the minor, if the program is available, or refer the minor to another agency for services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A hospital director shall proceed under either the estates and protected individuals code, 1998 PA 386, MCL 700.1101 to 700.8206, or chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.1 to 712A.32, as warranted by the situation and the best interests of the minor, under any of the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The hospital director cannot locate a parent, guardian, or person in loco parentis of a minor admitted to a hospital under subsection (8).</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   This section does not require a person to report suspected criminal abuse if either of the following applies:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The individual has knowledge that the incident of suspected criminal abuse has been reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency as provided in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The suspected criminal abuse occurred more than 1 year before the date on which it first became known to an individual who would otherwise be required to make a report.</DIV>

Consideration of less restrictive measures shall be documented in the medical record. If restraint is essential in order to prevent the resident from physically harming himself, herself, or others, the resident may be physically held with no more force than is necessary to limit the resident's movement, until a restraint may be applied.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A resident may be temporarily restrained for a maximum of 30 minutes without an order or authorization in an emergency. Immediately after imposition of the temporary restraint, a physician shall be contacted.

Authorized restraint may not continue for more than 4 hours.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A resident may be restrained pursuant to an order by a physician made after personal examination of the resident. An ordered restraint shall continue only for that period of time specified in the order or for 8 hours, whichever is less.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Restraints shall be removed every 2 hours for not less than 15 minutes unless medically contraindicated or whenever they are no longer essential in order to achieve the objective which justified their initial application.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Each instance of restraint requires full justification for its application, and the results of each periodic examination shall be placed promptly in the record of the resident.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   If a resident is restrained repeatedly, the resident's individual plan of services shall be reviewed and modified to facilitate the reduction of the use of restraints.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A contract entered into under this section may not be validly executed until the department has reviewed and approved the provisions of the contract and determined that the receiving agency provides services in accordance with the standards of this state and the attorney general has certified that the receiving state's laws governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   An individual does not establish legal residence in the state where the receiving agency is located while the individual is receiving services pursuant to a contract executed under this section.</DIV>

Further, the party states find that the necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but that, on the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and humanitarianism require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need of them. Consequently, it is the purpose of this compact and of the party states to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalization or other appropriate care and treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient under a system that recognizes the paramount importance of patient welfare and to establish the responsibilities of the party states in terms of such welfare.

If a finding of mental illness or developmental disability is made, the psychiatrist or psychologist shall recommend suitable treatment available within the corrections mental health program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Upon completion of the examination described in subdivision (a), if the psychiatrist or psychologist determines that the prisoner is mentally ill or developmentally disabled and is a present danger to himself or herself or to others, and if the prisoner refuses treatment, the psychiatrist may order involuntary administration of psychotropic medication pending a hearing under section 1003c.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Upon completion of the certificate required under subdivision (b), the officer in charge of the state correctional facility shall provide to the prisoner and the guardian of the person, if applicable, a copy of the certificate, a copy of the psychiatrist's or psychologist's report of the examination, and a notice of hearing explaining hearing procedures and rights set forth in section 1003c. The documents shall be provided at least 24 hours before the hearing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the prisoner agrees with the treatment recommended under subdivision (b), the prisoner may execute a waiver of hearing and consent to treatment.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The prisoner shall not be medicated for 24 hours before a hearing held under section 1003c.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) If, following a hearing held under section 1003c, the hearing committee finds that the prisoner is not mentally ill or developmentally disabled, the prisoner shall be placed according to normal procedures of the department of corrections. If the hearing committee finds that the prisoner is mentally ill or developmentally disabled and that the proposed services are suitable to the prisoner's condition, the corrections mental health program shall provide the mental health services designated by the hearing committee. If the hearing committee finds that the prisoner is mentally ill or developmentally disabled but that the proposed services are not suitable to the prisoner's condition, the corrections mental health program shall provide services that are available within the corrections mental health program that are suitable to the prisoner's condition as ordered by the hearing committee.</div>

If information made confidential by this subsection is disclosed, the identity of the individual to whom it pertains shall be protected and shall not be disclosed unless it is germane to the authorized purpose for which disclosure was sought; and, if practicable, other information shall not be disclosed unless it is germane to the authorized purpose for which disclosure was sought. A person receiving information made confidential by this subsection shall disclose the information to others only to the extent consistent with the authorized purpose for which the information was obtained. With the exception of records, data, and knowledge generated by individuals or committees performing a peer review function, which is not subject to disclosure, information pertaining to a prisoner receiving mental health services from the corrections mental health program may be disclosed under 1 or more of the following circumstances:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Pursuant to orders or subpoenas of a court of record, or subpoenas of the legislature, unless the information is made privileged by law.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If necessary to comply with another provision of law.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   A complaint regarding the provision of mental health services by the corrections mental health program has been received by the protection and advocacy system from or on behalf of the prisoner.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A defendant to a criminal charge shall be presumed competent to stand trial. He shall be determined incompetent to stand trial only if he is incapable because of his mental condition of understanding the nature and object of the proceedings against him or of assisting in his defense in a rational manner. The court shall determine the capacity of a defendant to assist in his defense by his ability to perform the tasks reasonably necessary for him to perform in the preparation of his defense and during his trial.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A defendant shall not be determined incompetent to stand trial because psychotropic drugs or other medication have been or are being administered under proper medical direction, and even though without such medication the defendant might be incompetent to stand trial. However, when the defendant is receiving such medication, the court may, prior to making its determination on the issue of incompetence to stand trial, require the filing of a statement by the treating physician that such medication will not adversely affect the defendant's understanding of the proceedings or his ability to assist in his defense.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The opinion concerning competency to stand trial derived from the examination may not be admitted as evidence for any purpose in the pending criminal proceedings, except on the issues to be determined in the hearings required or permitted by sections 1030 and 1040. The foregoing bar of testimony shall not be construed to prohibit the examining qualified clinician from presenting at other stages in the criminal proceedings opinions concerning criminal responsibility, disposition, or other issues if they were originally requested by the court and are available.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   On the basis of the evidence admitted at the hearing, the court shall determine the issue of the incompetence of the defendant to stand trial.
