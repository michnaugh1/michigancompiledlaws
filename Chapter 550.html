<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An organization may enter into a prudent purchaser agreement with 1 or more health care providers of a specific service to control health care costs, assure appropriate utilization of health care services, and maintain quality of health care. The organization may limit the number of prudent purchaser agreements entered into under this section if the number of agreements is sufficient to assure reasonable levels of access to health care services for recipients of those services. The number of prudent purchaser agreements authorized by this section that are necessary to assure reasonable levels of access to health care services for recipients shall be determined by the organization. However, the organization shall offer a prudent purchaser agreement, comparable to those agreements with other members of the provider panel, to at least 1 health care provider that provides the applicable health care services and is located within a reasonable distance from the recipients of those health care services, if a health care provider that provides the applicable health care services is located within that reasonable distance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An organization shall give all health care providers that provide the applicable health care services and are located in the geographic area served by the organization an opportunity to apply to the organization for membership on the provider panel.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An organization shall develop and institute procedures that are designed to notify health care providers located in the geographic area served by the organization of the acceptance of applications for a provider panel. The procedures shall include the giving of notice to providers of the service upon request and shall include publication in a newspaper with general circulation in the geographic area served by the organization at least 30 days before the initial provider application period. An organization shall provide for an initial 60-day provider application period during which providers of the service may apply to the organization for membership on the provider panel. An organization that has entered into a prudent purchaser agreement concerning a particular health care service shall provide, at least once every 4 years, for a 60-day provider application period during which providers of that service may apply to the organization for membership on the provider panel. Notice of this provider application period shall be given to providers of the service upon request and shall be published in a newspaper with general circulation in the geographic area served by the organization at least 30 days before the commencement of the provider application period. The initial 60-day provider application period and procedures and the 4-year 60-day provider application periods and procedures required under this subsection do not apply to organizations whose provider panels are open to application for membership at any time. Upon receipt of a request by a health care provider, the organization shall provide the written standards described in subsection (3) to the health care provider. Within 90 days after the close of a provider application period, or within 30 days following the completion of the applicable physician credentialing process, whichever is later, an organization shall notify an applicant in writing as to whether the applicant has been accepted or rejected for membership on the provider panel.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An organization that enters into a prudent purchaser agreement shall institute a program for the professional review of the quality of health care, performance of health care personnel, and utilization of services and facilities under the prudent purchaser agreement. At least every 2 years, the organization shall provide for an evaluation of its professional review program by a professionally recognized independent third party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If 2 or more classes of health care providers may legally provide the same health care service, the organization shall offer each class of health care providers the opportunity to apply to the organization for membership on the provider panel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Each prudent purchaser agreement shall state that the health care provider may be removed from the provider panel before the expiration of the agreement if the provider does not comply with the requirements of the contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) This act does not preclude a health care provider or health care facility from being a member of more than 1 provider panel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A provider panel may include health care providers and facilities outside this state if necessary to assure reasonable levels of access to health care services under coverage authorized by this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) When coverage authorized by this act is offered to a person, the organization shall give or cause to be given to the person the following information:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The identity of the collective bargaining agent if the coverage is offered pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If a person who has coverage authorized by this act is entitled to receive a health care service when rendered by a health care provider who is a member of the provider panel, the person is entitled to receive the health care service from a health care provider who is not a member of the provider panel for an emergency episode of illness or injury that requires immediate treatment before it can be obtained from a health care provider who is on the provider panel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Subsections (2) to (12) do not limit the authority of organizations to limit the number of prudent purchaser agreements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) If coverage under a prudent purchaser agreement provides for benefits for services that are within the scope of practice of optometry, this act does not require that coverage or reimbursement be provided for a practice of optometry service unless that service was included in the definition of practice of optometry under section 17401 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.17401, as of May 20, 1992.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) If coverage under a prudent purchaser agreement provides for benefits for services that are within the scope of practice of chiropractic, this act does not require that coverage or reimbursement be provided for a practice of chiropractic service unless that service was included in the definition of practice of chiropractic under section 16401 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.16401, as of January 1, 2009.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) If coverage under a prudent purchaser agreement provides for benefits for services that are provided by a licensed physical therapist or physical therapist assistant under the supervision of a licensed physical therapist, this act does not require that coverage or reimbursement be provided for services provided by a physical therapist or a physical therapist assistant unless that service was provided by a licensed physical therapist or physical therapist assistant under the supervision of a licensed physical therapist pursuant to a prescription from a health care professional who holds a license issued under part 166, 170, 175, or 180 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.16601 to 333.16648, 333.17001 to 333.17084, 333.17501 to 333.17556, and 333.18001 to 333.18058, or the equivalent license issued by another state.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As used in this act:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Allowable expense" means a health care expense, including coinsurance or copayments and without reduction for any applicable deductible, that is covered in full or in part by any of the plans covering the individual. The amount of a reduction may be excluded from allowable expense if a covered person's benefits are reduced under a primary plan for either of the following reasons:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Because the covered person does not comply with the plan provisions concerning second surgical opinions or precertification of admissions or services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Because the covered person has a lower benefit because the covered person did not use a preferred provider.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Claim" means a request that benefits of a plan be provided or paid. The benefits claimed may be in the form of any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Services including supplies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Payment for all or a portion of the expenses incurred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) A combination of subparagraphs (i) and (ii).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) An indemnification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Closed panel plan" means a plan that provides health benefits to covered persons primarily in the form of services through a panel of providers that have contracted with or are employed by the insurer that issues the plan and that excludes benefits for services provided by other providers, except in cases of emergency or referral by a panel member.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Coordination of benefits" or "COB" means a provision that establishes an order in which insurers pay claims, and that permits benefits paid under secondary plans to be reduced so that the combined benefits paid under all plans do not exceed 100% of the total allowable expenses of the claims.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) "Custodial parent" means any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The parent awarded custody of a child by a court order or judgment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) In the absence of a court order or judgment, the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year without regard to any temporary visitation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) "Dental care corporation" means a nonprofit dental care corporation incorporated under 1963 PA 125, MCL 550.351 to 550.373.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) "Group-type contract" means a contract that is not available to the general public and is obtained and maintained only because of membership in or a connection with a particular organization or group, including blanket coverage. Group-type contract does not include an individually underwritten and issued guaranteed renewable policy even if the policy is purchased through payroll deduction at a premium savings to the insured, because the insured would have the right to maintain or renew the policy independently of continued employment with the employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) "Health maintenance organization" means that term as defined in section 3501 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.3501.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) "Insurer" means that term as defined in section 106 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.106.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), "plan" means a form of health care coverage with which coordination is allowed. Separate parts of a plan for members of a group that are provided through alternative contracts and that are intended to be part of a coordinated package of benefits are considered 1 plan and there is not COB among the separate parts of the plan. If benefits are coordinated under a plan, the contract must state the types of coverage that will be considered in applying the COB provision of the contract. Whether the contract uses the term "plan" or some other term such as "program", the contractual definition must not be broader than the definition of "plan" in this subdivision. Plan includes any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Group and nongroup insurance contracts and subscriber contracts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Uninsured arrangements of group or group-type coverage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Group and nongroup coverage through closed panel plans.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Group-type contracts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) The medical care components of long-term care contracts, including skilled nursing care.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) Medicare or other governmental benefits, as permitted by law, except as provided in subsection (2)(g). Plan under this subdivision may be limited to the hospital, medical, and surgical benefits of the governmental program.</div>

July 1, 2016 <BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> For transfer of authority, powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities of the insurance bureau and the commissioner of insurance to the commissioner of the office of financial and insurance services and the office of financial and insurance services, see E.R.O. No. 2000-2, compiled at MCL 445.2003 of the Michigan compiled laws.</p>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If an individual is covered by 2 or more plans, the rules for determining the order of benefit payments are as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The insurer that issues the primary plan shall pay or provide benefits as if a secondary plan does not exist.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the individual is covered by more than 1 secondary plan, the order of benefit determination rules under this act determine the order under which secondary plan benefits are determined in relation to each other. An insurer that issues a secondary plan shall take into consideration the benefits of the primary plan and the benefits of any other plan that are, under this act, determined to be payable before those of the secondary plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Subject to subdivision (d), a plan that does not contain order of benefit determination provisions that are consistent with this act is always the primary plan unless the provisions of both plans, regardless of this subdivision, state that the complying plan is primary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If the primary plan is a closed panel plan and the secondary plan is not a closed panel plan, the insurer that issues the secondary plan shall pay or provide benefits as if it were the primary plan if a covered person uses a nonpanel provider, except for emergency services or authorized referrals that are paid or provided by the insurer that issued the primary plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The order in which benefits are payable by insurers that issue plans are determined by using the first of the following rules that applies:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The nondependent/dependent rule. If the individual is not a dependent but is an employee, member, subscriber, policyholder, or retiree under 1 plan and is a dependent under another plan, the order of payment of benefits under the plans is determined as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (ii), the plan that covers the individual other than as a dependent is the primary plan and the plan that covers the individual as a dependent is the secondary plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the individual is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of the provisions of title XVIII of the social security act, 42 USC 1395 to 1395lll, Medicare is secondary to the plan covering the individual as a dependent and primary to the plan covering the individual as other than a dependent, then the order of benefits is reversed and the plan covering the individual as other than a dependent is the secondary plan and the plan covering the individual as a dependent is the primary plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The dependent covered under more than 1 plan rule. If the individual is a dependent child, unless there is a court order or judgment stating otherwise, the order of payment of benefits under the plans covering the dependent child is determined as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the child's parents are married or are living together, whether or not they have ever been married, as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) The plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar year is the primary plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) If both parents have the same birthday, the plan that has covered the parent longest is the primary plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the child's parents are divorced, separated, or not living together, whether or not they have ever been married, as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) If a court order or judgment states that 1 of the parents is responsible for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the insurer that issued the plan of the parent with responsibility has actual knowledge of the terms of the order or judgment, that plan is the primary plan. If the parent with responsibility has no health care coverage for the dependent child's health care expenses, but that parent's spouse does, that parent's spouse's plan is the primary plan. This sub-subparagraph does not apply with respect to a plan year during which benefits are paid or provided before the insurer has actual knowledge of the terms of the court order or judgment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) If a court order or judgment states that both parents are responsible for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the order of benefits is determined in the manner prescribed in subparagraph (i).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(C) If a court order or judgment states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or health care coverage of the dependent child, the order of benefits is determined in the manner prescribed in subparagraph (i).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(D) If there is no court order or judgment allocating responsibility for the child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the order of benefits for the child are as follows, in the following order of priority:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(I) The plan covering the custodial parent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(II) The plan covering the custodial parent's spouse.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(III) The plan covering the noncustodial parent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(IV) The plan covering the noncustodial parent's spouse.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If the child is covered under more than 1 plan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the order of benefits is determined in the manner prescribed in subparagraph (i) or (ii), as applicable, as if those individuals were parents of the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) If the child is covered under either or both parents' plans and is also covered as a dependent under his or her spouse's plan, the order of benefits is determined in the manner prescribed in subdivision (e). If the dependent child's coverage under his or her spouse's plan began on the same date as his or her coverage under either or both parents' plans, the order of benefits is determined by applying the birthday rule prescribed in subparagraph (i) to the dependent child's parents, as applicable, and his or her spouse.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The active, retired, or laid-off employee rule. If the individual is an active employee, laid-off employee, or retired employee, or is a dependent of an active employee, laid-off employee, or retired employee, the order of payment of benefits under the plans covering the individual is determined as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The plan that covers the individual as an active employee or as a dependent of an active employee is the primary plan. The plan that covers the individual as a laid-off employee or retired employee or as a dependent of a laid-off employee or retired employee is the secondary plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Subparagraph (i) does not apply if the other plan that covers the individual does not have the rule described in subparagraph (i) and, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) This rule does not apply if the plan that covers the member, subscriber, enrollee, or retiree or the individual as a dependent of an employee, member, subscriber, enrollee, or retiree is the primary plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The continuation coverage rule. If the individual has coverage under a right of continuation pursuant to federal or state law, the order of payment of benefits under the plans covering the individual is determined as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The plan that covers the individual as an employee, member, subscriber, enrollee, or retiree or as a dependent of an employee, member, subscriber, enrollee, or retiree is the primary plan. The plan that covers the individual under the continuation coverage is the secondary plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Subparagraph (i) does not apply if the other plan that covers the individual does not have the rule described in subparagraph (i) and, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) This rule does not apply if the order of benefits can be determined by the rule in subdivision (a).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The longer or shorter length of coverage rule. If the rules in subdivisions (a) to (d) do not determine the order of benefits, the plan that has covered the individual for the longer period of time is the primary plan and the plan that has covered the individual for the shorter period of time is the secondary plan. To determine the length of time an individual has been covered under a plan, 2 successive plans are treated as 1 if the covered individual was eligible under the second plan within 24 hours after coverage under the first plan ended. Any of the following changes do not constitute the start of a new plan:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A change in the amount or scope of a plan's benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A change in the entity that pays, provides, or administers the plan's benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) A change from 1 type of plan to another, such as from a single-employer plan to a multiple-employer plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A person's length of time covered under a plan is measured from the person's first date of coverage under the plan. If that date is not readily available for a group plan, the date the person first became a member of the group must be used as the date from which to determine the length of time the person's coverage under the present plan has been in force.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the insurers that issued plans cannot agree on the order of benefits within 30 calendar days after the insurers have received all of the information needed to pay the claim, the insurers shall immediately pay the claim in equal shares and determine their relative liabilities following payment. An insurer is not required to pay more than it would have paid had the plan it issued been the primary plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as provided in subsection (6), in determining the amount to be paid on a claim by the insurer that issued a secondary plan, if the insurer wishes to coordinate benefits, the insurer shall calculate the benefits it would have paid on the claim in the absence of other health care coverage and apply the calculated amount to any allowable expense under its plan that is unpaid under the primary plan. The insurer that issued a secondary plan may reduce its payment by the calculated amount so that, when combined with the amount paid under the primary plan, the total benefits paid or provided under all plans for the claim do not exceed 100% of the total allowable expense for the claim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) In determining the amount to be paid on a dental plan claim by the insurer that issued a secondary plan, if the insurer wishes to coordinate benefits, it may do so in accordance with subsection (5) or, for not more than 2 years after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection, it may do so under a nonduplication of benefits method. Under a nonduplication of benefits method, the primary plan payment is subtracted from the secondary plan's allowable benefit amount. If there is a positive balance, the insurer that issued the secondary plan shall make a payment equal to the difference. If there is a negative or zero balance, the insurer that issued the secondary plan shall make no payment. If an insurer that issues a plan is advised by a covered person that all plans covering the person are high-deductible health plans and the person intends to contribute to a health savings account established in accordance with section 223 of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 223, the primary high-deductible health plan's deductible is not an allowable expense, except for any health care expense incurred that may not be subject to the deductible as described in section 223(c)(2)(C) of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 223.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A health maintenance organization is not required to pay claims or coordinate benefits for services that are not provided or authorized by the health maintenance organization and that are not benefits under the health maintenance contract.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Any clerical or record-keeping error, including a typographical error, a scrivener's error, or a computer error, regarding a required document or record that is found during an audit under this section does not, on its face, constitute fraud.

To the extent that an audit results in the identification of a clerical or record-keeping error, including a typographical error, a scrivener's error, or a computer error, in a required document or record, the pharmacy is not subject to recoupment of money by the carrier or pharmacy benefit manager unless clerical error or record-keeping error surpasses the statistical threshold established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or the carrier can provide proof of intent to commit fraud or the error results in actual financial harm to the carrier, pharmacy benefit manager, or a covered person or enrollee.</div>

Rebate does not include a fee, including, but not limited to, a bona fide service fee or administrative fee, that is not a formulary discount or remuneration described in this subdivision. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Third party" does not include a pharmacy benefit manager or carrier.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "340B drug" means a covered drug as that term is defined in 42 USC 256b.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 32.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A TPA, in connection with a benefit plan, shall provide in its service contract a provision that the person contracting for the services shall provide written notice to each individual covered by the plan, which written notice shall contain the following information:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   What benefits are being provided.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Of changes in benefits.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The fact that individuals covered by the plan are not insured or are only partially insured, as the case may be.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   If the plan is not insured, the fact that in the event the plan or the plan sponsor does not ultimately pay medical expenses that are eligible for payment under the plan for any reason, the individuals covered by the plan may be liable for those expenses.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The fact that the TPA merely processes claims and does not insure that any medical expenses of individuals covered by the plan will be paid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The fact that complete and proper claims for benefits made by individuals covered by the plan will be promptly processed but that in the event there are delays in processing claims, the individuals covered by the plan shall have no greater rights to interest or other remedies against the TPA than as otherwise afforded them by law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The written notice required by subsection (1) shall be prominently displayed in the summary plan description or in a separate document. The notice shall be communicated to the individuals covered by the plan within 60 days after becoming covered, upon each republication of the summary plan description, and in any case not less than every 5 years in a manner calculated to be received and understood by the average individual covered by the plan. As used in subsections (1) and (2), "individual covered by a plan" includes only 1 individual per family covered by a plan. The written notice required by this section shall not apply to any plan in effect on the effective date of this act until the earlier of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The due date under ERISA for distributing updated summary plan descriptions.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Two years after the effective date of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as provided in subsection (4), a TPA shall not enter into a service contract for a plan covering less than 500 individuals.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A TPA may enter into a service contract for a plan covering less than 500 individuals, if either the TPA makes arrangements for excess loss insurance or the sponsor of the plan is liable for the plan's liabilities and is a sponsor of 1 or more plans covering 500 or more individuals in the aggregate. The commissioner, upon the advice of the board, shall establish the standards for the manner and amount of the excess loss insurance required by this subsection. A TPA may continue to provide administrative services under a service contract for a plan covering less than 500 individuals if the service contract was in existence on the effective date of this act, including the renewal of that service contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A service contract between a TPA and a governmental entity not subject to ERISA, whose plan provides coverage under a collective bargaining agreement utilizing a policy or certificate issued by a carrier before the signing of the service contract, is void unless the governmental entity has provided the written notice described in subsection (1) to the collective bargaining agent and to the members of the collective bargaining unit not less than 30 days before signing the service contract. The voiding of a service contract under this subsection shall not relieve the governmental entity of any obligations to the TPA under the service contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Nothing in this act shall be construed to regulate or authorize an employee welfare benefit plan which is a multiple employer welfare arrangement. Nothing in this act shall be construed to permit an actionable interference by a TPA with the rights and obligations of the parties under a collective bargaining agreement.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A health benefit agent shall be a fiduciary for all money received or held by him or her in his or her capacity as an agent. Failure by an agent in a timely manner to turn over the money which he or she holds in a fiduciary capacity to the persons to whom they are owed is prima facie evidence of violation of the agent's fiduciary responsibility.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An agent shall use reasonable accounting methods to record funds received in his or her fiduciary capacity including the receipt and distribution of all premiums due each of his or her health benefit corporations. An agent shall record return premiums received by or credited to him or her which are due a subscriber on certificates reduced or canceled or which are due a prospective purchaser of health benefits as a result of a rejected or declined application. Records required by this section shall be open to examination by the commissioner.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 12.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A health benefit corporation shall give to the commissioner and the agent immediate written notice of the termination of an agent's authority to represent the health benefit corporation. The notice shall include the full disclosure, with supporting evidence, of acts or omissions by the agent which reasonably may be construed to be a violation of this act, or of any other statute, and acts or omissions which may reflect on the agent's qualifications as an agent or which may adversely affect the public interest.

During the period following notice of termination, the agent shall continue to represent the health benefit corporation in servicing existing certificates, but the agent shall not bind a new risk, renew a certificate, nor increase the obligation of the health benefit corporation under the certificate without the approval of the health benefit corporation. A health benefit corporation shall not cancel or refuse to renew the certificate of a subscriber because of the termination of an agent's contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A health benefit corporation's records and knowledge of names of subscribers and the expiration dates of certificates and contracts of subscribers who have purchased health benefits from an agent of the health benefit corporation shall not be referred nor communicated by the health benefit corporation to any other agent or person nor used by the health benefit corporation for the purpose of solicitation, unless the agent's authorization has been terminated pursuant to subsection (6)(a), (b), or (c).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the authorization of an agent authorized to sell health benefits on behalf of a health benefit corporation is terminated, the agent's records, use, and control of the names of subscribers and the expiration dates of certificates and contracts of subscribers who have purchased health benefits from the agent shall remain the property of the agent and be left to his or her undisputed possession, unless the agent's authority is terminated pursuant to subsection (6)(a), (b), or (c).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A copy of any written communication between a health benefit corporation and a subscriber shall be sent to the health benefit agent who sold the health benefits to the subscriber unless either of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The information is confidential under section 604 of the nonprofit health care corporation reform act, Act No. 350 of the Public Acts of 1980, being section 550.1604 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The health benefit corporation and the health benefit agent otherwise agree.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The commissioner, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, may suspend or revoke the accident and health insurance license of an agent who violates any provision of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   After notice and opportunity for a hearing, the commissioner may refuse to grant or renew an accident and health insurance license to act as an agent if he or she determines by a preponderance of the evidence, that it is probable that the business or primary occupation of the applicant will give rise to coercion, indirect rebating of commissions, or other practices in the sale of health benefits which are prohibited by law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Without prior hearing, the commissioner may order summary suspension of an accident and health insurance license if he or she finds that protection of the public requires emergency action and incorporates this finding in his or her order. The suspension shall be effective on the date specified in the order or upon service of a certified copy of the order on the licensee, whichever is later. If requested, the commissioner shall conduct a hearing on the suspension within a reasonable time but not later than 20 days after the effective date of the summary suspension unless the person whose license is suspended requests a later date. At the hearing, the commissioner shall determine if the suspension should be continued or if the suspension should be withdrawn, and, if proper notice is given, may determine if the license should be revoked. The commissioner shall announce his or her decision within 30 days after conclusion of the hearing. The suspension shall continue until the decision is announced.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The commissioner, or his or her designated deputy, may issue subpoenas with the approval of a circuit court judge of the circuit court of Ingham county to require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documents necessary to the conduct of the hearing and may designate an employee of the insurance bureau to make service thereof. The subpoenas issued by the commissioner, or his or her designated deputy, may be enforced upon application by them to the circuit court of Ingham county by proceedings in contempt thereof, as provided by law.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The commissioner may by order, after notice and opportunity for hearing, reopen and alter, modify, or set aside, in whole or in part, an order issued under this section, if in the opinion of the commissioner conditions of fact or of law have changed to require that action, or if the public interest requires that action.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a person knowingly violates a cease and desist order under this act and has been given notice and an opportunity for a hearing held pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, the commissioner may order a civil fine of not more than $10,000.00 for each violation, or a suspension or revocation of the person's license or certificate of authority, or both.

  <p><BR><B>History:</B> 1980, Act 350, Eff. Apr. 3, 1981 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> Procedural fairness is required by the due process clause before governmental action drastically alters essential terms of the contract between nonprofit group health care plans and hospitals and nursing homes providing health care services; however, the guarantee of procedural due process does not necessarily require an adversary proceeding. Convalescent Center v Blue Cross, 414 Mich 247; 324 NW2d 851 (1982).Administrative hearings under the Administrative Procedures Act, however informal, comport with the procedural fairness required by due process in the absence of an explicit statutory requirement that a contested evidentiary hearing be held. Convalescent Center v Blue Cross, 414 Mich 247; 324 NW2d 851 (1982).This act is unconstitutional in the following three particulars:(1) The act's provision for an actuary panel to resolve risk factor disputes is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority in that it lacks adequate standards (MCL 550.1205(6)).(2) The statutory restrictions on administrative services only (ASO) contracts violate equal protection of the laws insofar as they result in arbitrary and discriminatory treatment of health care corporations vis-a-vis commercial insurers (MCL 550.1104(3), 550.1211, 550.1414a, 550.1415, and 550.1607(1)).(3) The commissioner's authority to issue a cease and desist order based on probable cause against a health care corporation for noncompliance with the act establishes an improper burden of proof (MCL 550.1402(7)).The Supreme Court ruling on these three areas of this act does not affect the constitutionality of the remainder of the act. Where, as here, the unconstitutional provisions are easily severable, the remainder of the act need not be affected.

<P>Sec. 102.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   It is the purpose of and intent of this act, and the policy of the legislature, to promote an appropriate distribution of health care services for all residents of this state, to promote the progress of the science and art of health care in this state, and to assure for nongroup and group subscribers, reasonable access to, and reasonable cost and quality of, health care services, in recognition that the health care financing system is an essential part of the general health, safety, and welfare of the people of this state. Each corporation subject to this act is declared to be a charitable and benevolent institution and its funds and property shall be exempt from taxation by this state or any political subdivision of this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   It is the intention of the legislature that this act shall be construed to provide for the regulation and supervision of nonprofit health care corporations by the commissioner of insurance so as to secure for all of the people of this state who apply for a certificate, the opportunity for access to health care services at a fair and reasonable price.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   It is the public policy of this state that, in the interest of facilitating access to health care services at a fair and reasonable price, an alternate, expeditious, and effective procedure for the resolution of issues and the maintenance of administrative appeals relative to provider class plans be established and utilized, and to that end, the provisions of this act regarding administrative review of those provider class plans shall be construed so as to minimize uncertainty and delays.</DIV>

        Am. 1993, Act 127, Imd. Eff. July 21, 1993 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> This act is unconstitutional in the following three particulars:(1) The act's provision for an actuary panel to resolve risk factor disputes is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority in that it lacks adequate standards (MCL 550.1205(6)).(2) The statutory restrictions on administrative services only (ASO) contracts violate equal protection of the laws insofar as they result in arbitrary and discriminatory treatment of health care corporations vis-a-vis commercial insurers (MCL 550.1104(3), 550.1211, 550.1414a, 550.1415, and 550.1607(1)).(3) The commissioner's authority to issue a cease and desist order based on probable cause against a health care corporation for noncompliance with the act establishes an improper burden of proof (MCL 550.1402(7)).The Supreme Court ruling on these three areas of this act does not affect the constitutionality of the remainder of the act. Where, as here, the unconstitutional provisions are easily severable, the remainder of the act need not be affected.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   An act of a health care corporation, otherwise lawful, is not invalid because the corporation was without capacity or power to do the act. However, the lack of capacity or power may be asserted:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   In an action by a director or a member of the corporate body against the corporation to enjoin the doing of an act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   In an action by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor against an incumbent or former officer or director of the corporation for loss or damage due to an unauthorized act of that officer or director.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 211.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Pursuant to section 207(1)(g), a health care corporation may enter into service contracts containing an administrative services only or cost-plus arrangement. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a corporation shall not enter into a service contract containing an administrative services only or cost-plus arrangement for a noninsured benefit plan covering a group of less than 500 individuals, except that a health care corporation may continue an administrative services only or cost-plus arrangement with a group of less than 500, which arrangement is in existence in September of 1980. A corporation may enter into contracts containing an administrative services only or cost-plus arrangement for a noninsured benefit plan covering a group of less than 500 individuals if either the corporation makes arrangements for excess loss coverage or the sponsor of the plan that covers the individuals is liable for the plan's liabilities and is a sponsor of 1 or more plans covering a group of 500 or more individuals in the aggregate. The commissioner, upon obtaining the advice of the corporations subject to this act, shall establish the standards for the manner and amount of the excess loss coverage required by this subsection. It is the intent of the legislature that the excess loss coverage requirements be uniform as between corporations subject to this act and other persons authorized to provide similar services. The corporation shall offer in connection with a noninsured benefit plan a program of specific or aggregate excess loss coverage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Relative to actual administrative costs, fees for administrative services only and cost-plus arrangements shall be set in a manner that precludes cost transfers between subscribers subject to either of these arrangements and other subscribers of the health care corporation. Administrative costs for these arrangements shall be determined in accordance with the administrative costs allocation methodology and definitions filed and approved under part 6, and shall be expressed clearly and accurately in the contracts establishing the arrangements, as a percentage of costs rather than charges. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit the inclusion, in fees charged, of contributions to adequate and unimpaired surplus as provided in section 204a.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Before a health care corporation may enter into contracts containing administrative services only or cost-plus arrangements pursuant to section 207(1)(g), the board of directors of the corporation shall approve a marketing policy for these arrangements that is consistent with this section. The marketing policy may contain other provisions as the board considers necessary. The marketing policy shall be carried out by the corporation consistent with this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A corporation providing services under a contract containing an administrative services only or cost-plus arrangement in connection with a noninsured benefit plan shall provide in its service contract a provision that the person contracting for the services in connection with a noninsured benefit plan shall notify each covered individual of what services are being provided; the fact that individuals are not insured or are not covered by a certificate from the corporation, or are only partially insured or are only partially covered by a certificate from the corporation, as the case may be; which party is liable for payment of benefits; and of future changes in benefits.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A service contract containing an administrative services only arrangement between a corporation and a governmental entity not subject to the employee retirement income security act of 1974, Public Law 93-406, 88 Stat. 829, whose plan provides coverage under a collective bargaining agreement utilizing a policy or certificate issued by a carrier before the signing of the service contract, is void unless the governmental entity has provided the notice described in subsection (4) to the collective bargaining agent and to the members of the collective bargaining unit not less than 30 days before signing the service contract. The voiding of a service contract under this subsection shall not relieve the governmental entity of any obligations to the corporation under the service contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit an actionable interference by a corporation with the rights and obligations of the parties under a collective bargaining agreement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   An individual covered under a noninsured benefit plan for which services are provided under a service contract authorized under subsection (1) is not liable for that portion of claims incurred and subject to payment under the plan if the service contract is entered into between an employer and a corporation, unless that portion of the claim has been paid directly to the covered individual.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   A corporation shall report with its annual statement the amount of business it has conducted as services provided under subsection (1) that are performed in connection with a noninsured benefit plan, and the commissioner shall transmit annually this information to the state treasurer. The commissioner shall submit to the legislature on April 1, 1994, a report detailing the impact of this section on employers and covered individuals, and similar activities under other provisions of law, and in consultation with the state treasurer the total financial impact on the state for the preceding legislative biennium.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   As used in this section, "noninsured benefit plan" or "plan" means a health benefit plan without coverage by a health care corporation, health maintenance organization, or insurer or the portion of a health benefit plan without coverage by a health care corporation, health maintenance organization, or insurer that has a specific or aggregate excess loss coverage.</DIV>

July 23, 2003 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> This act is unconstitutional in the following three particulars:(1) The act's provision for an actuary panel to resolve risk factor disputes is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority in that it lacks adequate standards (MCL 550.1205(6)).(2) The statutory restrictions on administrative services only (ASO) contracts violate equal protection of the laws insofar as they result in arbitrary and discriminatory treatment of health care corporations vis-a-vis commercial insurers (MCL 550.1104(3), 550.1211, 550.1414a, 550.1415, and 550.1607(1)).(3) The commissioner's authority to issue a cease and desist order based on probable cause against a health care corporation for noncompliance with the act establishes an improper burden of proof (MCL 550.1402(7)).The Supreme Court ruling on these three areas of this act does not affect the constitutionality of the remainder of the act.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Delay the investigation or processing of a claim by requiring a covered individual, or the provider of services to the covered individual, to submit a preliminary claim and then requiring subsequent submission of a formal claim, seeking solely the duplication of a verification.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Offer to make or make an agreement relating to a service contract or certificate other than as plainly expressed in the service contract or certificate. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Offer to give or pay, or give or pay, directly or indirectly, a rebate or adjustment of the rate payable on the service contract or certificate, or an advantage in the services thereunder, except as reflected in the rate and expressly provided in the service contract or certificate. Readjustment of the rate for services provided under the service contract or certificate may be made at the end of a contract or certificate year or contract or certificate period and may be made retroactive.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Make, issue, or circulate, or cause to be made, issued, or circulated, an estimate, illustration, circular, or statement misrepresenting the terms of a service contract or certificate, the advantages provided thereunder, or the true nature thereof.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Make a misrepresentation or incomplete comparison, whether oral or written, between service contracts or certificates of the corporation or between service contracts or certificates of the corporation and an insurer, hospital service corporation, health maintenance organization, or other person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A corporation providing services under section 211 in connection with a noninsured benefit plan shall process claims for benefits on a timely basis. If not paid on a timely basis, benefits payable to a covered individual shall bear simple interest from a date 60 days after a satisfactory claim form was received by the corporation, at a rate of 12% interest per annum. The interest shall be paid by the noninsured benefit plan in addition to, and at the time of payment of, the claim.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A corporation providing services under section 211 in connection with a noninsured benefit plan shall specify in writing the materials that constitute a satisfactory claim form not later than 30 days after receipt of a claim, unless the claim is settled within 30 days. If a claim form is not supplied as to the entire claim, the amount supported by the claim form shall be considered to be paid on a timely basis if paid within 60 days after receipt of the claim form by the corporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A corporation providing services under section 211 in connection with a noninsured benefit plan shall provide in its service contract a provision that the person contracting for the services in connection with a noninsured benefit plan shall notify each covered individual as to what services are being provided; the fact that individuals are not insured or are not covered by a certificate from the corporation, or are only partially insured or are only partially covered by a certificate from the corporation, as the case may be; which party is liable for payment of benefits; and of future changes in benefits.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If the commissioner has probable cause to believe that a corporation is violating, or has violated subsection (2), indicating a persistent tendency to engage in conduct prohibited by that subsection, or has probable cause to believe that a corporation is violating, or has violated any other subsection of this section, he or she shall give written notice to the corporation, pursuant to the administrative procedures act, setting forth the general nature of the complaint against the corporation and the proceedings contemplated under this section. Before the issuance of a notice of hearing, the staff of the insurance bureau responsible for the matters that would be at issue in the hearing shall give the corporation an opportunity to confer and discuss the possible complaint and proceedings in person with the commissioner or a representative of the commissioner, and the matter may be disposed of summarily upon agreement of the parties. This subsection shall not be construed to diminish the right of a person to bring an action for damages under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   A hearing held pursuant to subsection (7) shall be held pursuant to the administrative procedures act. If, after the hearing, the commissioner determines that the corporation is violating, or has violated subsection (2), indicating a persistent tendency to engage in conduct prohibited by that subsection, or has violated or is violating any other subsection of this section, the commissioner shall reduce his or her findings and decision to writing, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the corporation a copy of the findings and an order requiring the corporation to cease and desist from engaging in the prohibited activity. In addition to a cease and desist order, the commissioner may order any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Payment of a monetary penalty of not more than $500.00 for each violation but not to exceed an aggregate penalty of $5,000.00, unless the corporation knew or reasonably should have known it was in violation of this section, in which case the penalty shall not be more than $2,500.00 for each violation and shall not exceed an aggregate penalty of $25,000.00 for all violations committed in a 6-month period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Suspension or revocation of the corporation's license or certificate of authority if the corporation knowingly and persistently violated this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Refund of any overcharges.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   A corporation that violates a cease and desist order of the commissioner issued under subsection (8), after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, and upon order of the commissioner, may be subject to a civil fine of not more than $10,000.00 for each violation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   In addition to other remedies provided by law, an aggrieved covered individual may bring an action for actual monetary damages sustained as a result of a violation of this section. If successful on the merits, the covered individual shall be awarded actual monetary damages or $200.00, whichever is greater. If the corporation shows by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation of this section resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid the error, the amount of recovery shall be limited to actual monetary damages.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   The filing of a petition for review does not stay enforcement of action pursuant to this section, but the commissioner may grant, or the appropriate court may order, a stay upon appropriate terms.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   The commissioner may at any time, by order, after notice and opportunity for hearing, reopen and alter, modify, or set aside, in whole or in part, an order issued by him or her under this section, when in his or her opinion conditions of fact or of law have so changed as to require that action or if the public interest shall so require.</DIV>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>550.1213 Indemnification.</B><P>
</P>
<P>Sec. 213.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A health care corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, other than an action by or in the right of the health care corporation, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, member of the corporate body, officer, employee, or agent of the health care corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the health care corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. This indemnification shall be against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the action, suit, or proceeding, if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the health care corporation, or its subscribers as a whole, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the health care corporation, or its subscribers as a whole, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A health care corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the health care corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, member of the corporate body, officer, employee, or agent of the health care corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the health care corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. This indemnification shall be against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or settlement of the action or suit, if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the health care corporation, or its subscribers as a whole. However, indemnification shall not be made with respect to any claim, issue, or matter as to which the person has been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his or her duty to the health care corporation unless, and only to the extent that, the court in which the action or suit was brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for those expenses which the court considers proper.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   To the extent that a director, member of the corporate body, officer, employee, or agent of a health care corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding referred to in subsection (1) or (2), or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Any indemnification under subsection (1) or (2), unless ordered by a court, shall be made by the health care corporation only as authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that indemnification of the director, member of the corporate body, officer, employee, or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (1) and (2). The determination shall be made in any of the following ways:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   By the board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit, or proceeding.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If such a quorum is not obtainable, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit, or proceeding described in subsection (1) or (2) may be paid by the health care corporation in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit, or proceeding, as authorized in the manner provided in subsection (4), upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, member of the corporate body, officer, employee, or agent to repay that amount, unless it is ultimately determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the corporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A provision made to indemnify directors, members of the corporate body, or officers in any action, suit, or proceeding referred to in subsection (1) or (2), whether contained in the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, a resolution of the directors, an agreement, or otherwise, shall be invalid only insofar as it is in conflict with subsections (1) to (5) and this subsection. Nothing contained in subsections (1) to (5) and this subsection shall affect any rights to indemnification to which persons other than directors and officers may be entitled by contract or otherwise by law. The indemnification provided in subsections (1) to (5) and this subsection continues as to a person who has ceased to be a director, member of the corporate body, officer, employee, or agent, and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of that person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A health care corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the health care corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in that capacity, or arising out of his or her status as described in this subsection, whether or not the health care corporation would have power to indemnify him or her against this liability under subsections (1) to (6).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   For the purposes of subsections (1) to (7), references to a health care corporation include all constituent corporations absorbed in a consolidation or merger and the resulting or surviving corporation, so that a person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of a constituent corporation or is or was serving at the request of such a constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this section with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would if he or she had served the resulting or surviving corporation in the same capacity.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Notwithstanding any provision of this act to the contrary, a health care corporation may establish, own, operate, and merge with a nonprofit mutual disability insurer formed under chapter 58 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.5800 to 500.5840. The surviving entity of a merger described in this subsection is the nonprofit mutual disability insurer. A merger described in this subsection is exempt from the application of sections 1311 to 1319 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.1311 to 500.1319.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The merger of a health care corporation with a nonprofit mutual disability insurer is effective upon completion of both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The adoption of a plan of merger by the majority of the boards of directors of both the health care corporation and the nonprofit mutual disability insurer. The health care corporation shall include in the plan of merger that beginning in April of the first full calendar year after the adoption of the plan of merger the surviving entity of a merger described in subsection (1) shall use its best efforts to make annual social mission contributions in an aggregate amount of up to $1,560,000,000.00 over a period of up to 18 years beginning in April of the first full calendar year after the adoption of the plan of merger to a nonprofit corporation created under part 6A. If adopted, the boards of directors shall submit the plan of merger to the commissioner for his or her consideration as provided in subdivision (b). A nonprofit mutual disability insurer is considered to be making its best effort under this subdivision if it makes the annual social mission contribution to a nonprofit corporation created in part 6A when the nonprofit mutual disability insurer's surplus is at least 375% of the authorized control level under risk-based capital requirements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The approval of the plan of merger by the commissioner. The commissioner shall make a determination to approve or disapprove a plan of merger within 90 days of receipt of the plan, and the commissioner shall not unreasonably withhold approval of a plan of merger submitted under subdivision (a).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act to the contrary, the directors of a health care corporation may serve as incorporators of the corporate body of, directors of, or officers of the nonprofit mutual disability insurer formed through a merger described in subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A merger described in subsection (1) is the dissolution of the health care corporation, and the surviving nonprofit mutual disability insurer assumes the performance of all contracts and policies of the merged health care corporation that exist on the date of the merger, including the participating hospital agreement, and its definition of certificate which excludes as covered services benefits provided pursuant to automobile no-fault or worker's compensation coverage, and all related contract obligations that result from orders relating to hospital provider class plans that are issued by the commissioner after July 1, 2012. However, the officers of a health care corporation may perform any act or acts necessary to close the affairs of the merged health care corporation after the date of the merger.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Notwithstanding anything in this act to the contrary, if the merger of a health care corporation and a nonprofit mutual disability insurer becomes effective as described in subsection (2), the property of the health care corporation is subject to the collection of general ad valorem taxes and applicable specific taxes under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, beginning December 31, 2013. As provided in section 201, the property of a health care corporation is exempt from taxation before December 31, 2013. This act does not confer an exemption from taxation on a nonprofit mutual disability insurer that merges with a health care corporation.</div>

The board shall exercise the powers and authority necessary to carry out the lawful purposes of the corporation, as limited by this act and the articles of incorporation and the bylaws of the corporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Four voting members of the board shall be representatives of the public appointed by the governor by and with the advice and consent of the senate. Two of those members shall be retired individuals 62 years of age or older. The term of office of each representative of the public shall be 2 years, and until a successor is appointed and qualified.

The method of selection shall neither permit nor require nomination, endorsement, approval, or confirmation of a candidate or director by the corporate body, the board of directors, or the management of the health care corporation, or any member or members of any of these. This subsection shall not apply to the selection of an officer or employee as a director pursuant to subsection (4). This subsection shall not limit the rights of any director, member of the corporate body, or employee or officer of the health care corporation to participate in the selection process in his or her capacity as a subscriber, to the same extent as any other subscriber may participate.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   For purposes of determining whether a director is a provider director, "health care provider" or "provider" does not include a spouse, child, or parent of a health care provider who resides in the same household if all of the following criteria are met:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Not more than 1/3 of the total annual household income is earned by that health care provider.</DIV>

        Am. 1989, Act 132, Eff. Nov. 1, 1989 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> This act is unconstitutional in the following three particulars:(1) The act's provision for an actuary panel to resolve risk factor disputes is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority in that it lacks adequate standards (MCL 550.1205(6)).(2) The statutory restrictions on administrative services only (ASO) contracts violate equal protection of the laws insofar as they result in arbitrary and discriminatory treatment of health care corporations vis-a-vis commercial insurers (MCL 550.1104(3), 550.1211, 550.1414a, 550.1415, and 550.1607(1)).(3) The commissioner's authority to issue a cease and desist order based on probable cause against a health care corporation for noncompliance with the act establishes an improper burden of proof (MCL 550.1402(7)).The Supreme Court ruling on these three areas of this act does not affect the constitutionality of the remainder of the act. Where, as here, the unconstitutional provisions are easily severable, the remainder of the act need not be affected.

</P>
<P>Sec. 404.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A person who has reason to believe that a health care corporation has violated section 402 or 403, if the violation was with respect to an action or inaction of the corporation with respect to that person, is entitled to a private informal managerial-level conference with the corporation, and to a review before the commissioner or his or her designee through September 30, 2000 and beginning October 1, 2000 before an independent review organization under the patient's right to independent review act, if the conference fails to resolve the dispute.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A health care corporation shall establish reasonable internal procedures to provide a person with a private informal managerial-level conference as provided in subsection (1). These procedures shall provide all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That a final determination will be made in writing by the health care corporation not later than 35 calendar days after a grievance is submitted in writing by the member. The timing for the 35-calendar-day period may be tolled, however, for any period of time the member is permitted to take under the grievance procedure and for a period of time that shall not exceed 10 days if the health care corporation has not received requested information from a health provider. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A method of providing the person, upon request and payment of a reasonable copying charge, with information pertinent to the denial of a certificate or to the rate charged.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A method for resolving the dispute promptly and informally, while protecting the interests of both the person and the corporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   That when an adverse determination is made, a written statement in plain English containing the reasons for the adverse determination is provided to the member along with written notifications as required under the patient's right to independent review act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   A method for providing summary data on the number and types of complaints and grievances filed. Beginning April 15, 2001, this summary data for the prior calendar year shall be filed annually with the commissioner on forms provided by the commissioner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the health care corporation fails to provide a conference and proposed resolution within 30 days after a request by a person, or if the person disagrees with the proposed resolution of the corporation after completion of the conference, the person is entitled to a determination of the matter by the commissioner or his or her designee through September 30, 2000 and beginning October 1, 2000 by an independent review organization under the patient's right to independent review act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A health care corporation shall establish, as part of its internal procedures, an expedited grievance procedure. The expedited grievance procedure shall provide that a determination will be made by the health care corporation not later than 72 hours after receipt of the grievance. Within 10 days after receipt of a determination, the member may request a determination of the matter by the commissioner or his or her designee through September 30, 2000 and beginning October 1, 2000 by an independent review organization under the patient's right to independent review act. If the determination by the health care corporation is made orally, the health care corporation shall provide a written confirmation of the determination to the member not later than 2 business days after the oral determination. An expedited grievance under this subsection applies if a grievance is submitted and a physician, orally or in writing, substantiates that the time frame for a grievance under subsections (1) to (3) would seriously jeopardize the life or health of the member or would jeopardize the member's ability to regain maximum function. This subsection does not apply to a provider's complaint concerning claims payment, handling, or reimbursement for health care services. As used in this section, "grievance" means an oral or written statement, by a member to the health care corporation that the health care corporation has wrongfully refused or failed to respond in a timely manner to a request for benefits or payment.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Upon due notice and an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing pursuant to the administrative procedures act, the commissioner may suspend or limit the certificate of authority of a health care corporation if the commissioner determines that any of the following circumstances exist:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The health care corporation does not meet the requirements of this act respecting the adequacy of its reserves.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The health care corporation is using methods or practices in the conduct of its business which render further transactions hazardous or injurious to subscribers of the corporation or the public.</DIV>

The commissioner may subsequently disapprove any certificate deemed approved.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The commissioner shall exempt from prior approval certificates resulting from a collective bargaining agreement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The commissioner may disapprove, or approve with modifications, a certificate and applicable rates under 1 or more of the following circumstances:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the rate charged for the benefits provided is not equitable, not adequate, or excessive, as defined in section 609.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the certificate contains 1 or more provisions which are unjust, unfair, inequitable, misleading, deceptive, or which encourage misrepresentation of the coverage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If a certificate reduces the scope, amount, or duration of benefits so as to have the effect of reducing the comprehensiveness of existing health care benefits available to groups or to individuals. The commissioner may approve a certificate which reduces the scope, amount, or duration of health care benefits if the commissioner determines that the certificate will be offered as an alternative in addition to an existing certificate which provides comprehensive health care benefits and if the commissioner determines that approval of the alternative certificate will not adversely affect the opportunity for groups or individuals to obtain comprehensive health care benefits.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The commissioner shall approve a certificate and applicable proposed rates if all of the following conditions are met:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the rate charged for the benefits provided is equitable, adequate, and not excessive, as defined in section 609.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the certificate does not contain any provision which is unjust, unfair, inequitable, misleading, deceptive, or which encourages misrepresentation of the coverage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the commissioner disapproves a certificate and any applicable proposed rates under this section, he or she shall issue a notice of disapproval which specifies in what respects a filing fails to meet the requirements of this act. The notice shall state that the filing shall not become effective.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If the commissioner approves, or approves with modifications, a certificate and any applicable proposed rates under this section, he or she shall issue a notice of approval or approval with modifications. If the notice is of approval with modifications, the notice shall specify what modifications in the filing are required for approval under this act, and the reasons for the modifications. The notice shall also state that the filing shall become effective after the modifications are made and approved by the commissioner.</DIV>

  <p><BR><B>History:</B> 1980, Act 350, Eff. Apr. 3, 1981 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> This act is unconstitutional in the following three particulars:(1) The act's provision for an actuary panel to resolve risk factor disputes is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority in that it lacks adequate standards (MCL 550.1205(6)).(2) The statutory restrictions on administrative services only (ASO) contracts violate equal protection of the laws insofar as they result in arbitrary and discriminatory treatment of health care corporations vis-a-vis commercial insurers (MCL 550.1104(3), 550.1211, 550.1414a, 550.1415, and 550.1607(1)).(3) The commissioner's authority to issue a cease and desist order based on probable cause against a health care corporation for noncompliance with the act establishes an improper burden of proof (MCL 550.1402(7)).The Supreme Court ruling on these three areas of this act does not affect the constitutionality of the remainder of the act. Where, as here, the unconstitutional provisions are easily severable, the remainder of the act need not be affected.

</P>
<P>Sec. 608.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The rates charged to nongroup subscribers for each certificate shall be filed in accordance with section 610 and shall be subject to the prior approval of the commissioner. Annually, the commissioner shall approve, disapprove, or modify and approve the proposed or existing rates for each certificate subject to the standard that the rates must be determined to be equitable, adequate, and not excessive, as defined in section 609. The burden of proof that rates to be charged meet these standards shall be upon the health care corporation proposing to use the rates.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The methodology and definitions of each rating system, formula, component, and factor used to calculate rates for group subscribers for each certificate, including the methodology and definitions used to calculate administrative costs for administrative services only and cost-plus arrangements, shall be filed in accordance with section 610 and shall be subject to the prior approval of the commissioner. The definition of a group, including any clustering principles applied to nongroup subscribers or small group subscribers for the purpose of group formation, shall be subject to the prior approval of the commissioner. However, if a Michigan caring program is created under section 436, that program shall be defined as a group program for the purpose of establishing rates. The commissioner shall approve, disapprove, or modify and approve the methodology and definitions of each rating system, formula, component, and factor for each certificate subject to the standard that the resulting rates for group subscribers must be determined to be equitable, adequate, and not excessive, as defined in section 609. In addition, the commissioner may from time to time review the records of the corporation to determine proper application of a rating system, formula, component, or factor with respect to any group. The corporation shall refile for approval under this subsection, every 3 years, the methodology and definitions of each rating system, formula, component, and factor used to calculate rates for group subscribers, including the methodology and definitions used to calculate administrative costs for administrative services only and cost-plus arrangements. The burden of proof that the resulting rates to be charged meet these standards shall be upon the health care corporation proposing to use the rating system, formula, component, or factor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A proposed rate shall not take effect until a filing has been made with the commissioner and approved under section 607 or this section, as applicable, except as provided in subsections (4) and (5).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Upon request by a health care corporation, the commissioner may allow rate adjustments to become effective prior to approval, for federal or state mandated benefit changes. However, a filing for these adjustments shall be submitted before the effective date of the mandated benefit changes. If the commissioner disapproves or modifies and approves the rates, an adjustment shall be made retroactive to the effective date of the mandated benefit changes or additions.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Implementation prior to approval may be allowed if the health care corporation is participating with 1 or more health care corporations to underwrite a group whose employees are located in several states. Upon request from the commissioner, the corporation shall file with the commissioner, and the commissioner shall examine, the financial arrangement, formulae, and factors. If any are determined to be unacceptable, the commissioner shall take appropriate action.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 609.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A rate is not excessive if the rate is not unreasonably high relative to the following elements, individually or collectively; provision for anticipated benefit costs; provision for administrative expense; provision for cost transfers, if any; provision for a contribution to or from surplus that is consistent with the attainment or maintenance of adequate and unimpaired surplus as provided in section 204a; and provision for adjustments due to prior experience of groups, as defined in the group rating system. A determination as to whether a rate is excessive relative to these elements, individually or collectively, shall be based on the following: reasonable evaluations of recent claim experience; projected trends in claim costs; the allocation of administrative expense budgets; and the present and anticipated unimpaired surplus of the health care corporation. To the extent that any of these elements are considered excessive, the provision in the rates for these elements shall be modified accordingly.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The administrative expense budget must be reasonable, as determined by the commissioner after examination of material and substantial administrative and acquisition expense items.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A rate is equitable if the rate can be compared to any other rate offered by the health care corporation to its subscribers, and the observed rate differences can be supported by differences in anticipated benefit costs, administrative expense cost, differences in risk, or any identified cost transfer provisions.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A rate is adequate if the rate is not unreasonably low relative to the elements prescribed in subsection (1), individually or collectively, based on reasonable evaluations of recent claim experience, projected trends in claim costs, the allocation of administrative expense budgets, and the present and anticipated unimpaired surplus of the health care corporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Except for identified cost transfers, each line of business, over time, shall be self-sustaining. However, there may be cost transfers for the benefit of senior citizens and group conversion subscribers. Cost transfers for the benefit of senior citizens, in the aggregate, annually shall not exceed 1% of the earned subscription income of the health care corporation as reported in the most recent annual statement of the corporation. Group conversion subscribers are those who have maintained coverage with the health care corporation on an individual basis after leaving a subscriber group.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 610.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as provided under section 608(4) or (5), a filing of information and materials relative to a proposed rate shall be made not less than 120 days before the proposed effective date of the proposed rate. A filing shall not be considered to have been received until there has been substantial and material compliance with the requirements prescribed in subsections (6) and (8).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Within 30 days after a filing is made of information and materials relative to a proposed rate, the commissioner shall do either of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Give written notice to the corporation, and to each person described under section 612(1), that the filing is in material and substantial compliance with subsections (6) and (8) and that the filing is complete. The commissioner shall then proceed to approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the rate filing 60 days after receipt of the filing, based upon whether the filing meets the requirements of this act. However, if a hearing has been requested under section 613, the commissioner shall not approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove a filing until the hearing has been completed and an order issued.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Give written notice to the corporation that the corporation has not yet complied with subsections (6) and (8). The notice shall state specifically in what respects the filing fails to meet the requirements of subsections (6) and (8).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Within 10 days after the filing of notice pursuant to subsection (2)(b), the corporation shall submit to the commissioner such additional information and materials, as requested by the commissioner. Within 10 days after receipt of the additional information and materials, the commissioner shall determine whether the filing is in material and substantial compliance with subsections (6) and (8). If the commissioner determines that the filing does not yet materially and substantially meet the requirements of subsections (6) and (8), the commissioner shall give notice to the corporation pursuant to subsection (2)(b) or use visitation of the corporation's facilities and examination of the corporation's records to obtain the necessary information described in the notice issued pursuant to subsection (2)(b). The commissioner shall use either procedure previously mentioned, or a combination of both procedures, in order to obtain the necessary information as expeditiously as possible. The per diem, traveling, reproduction, and other necessary expenses in connection with visitation and examination shall be paid by the corporation, and shall be credited to the general fund of the state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a filing is approved, approved with modifications, or disapproved under subsection (2)(a), the commissioner shall issue a written order of the approval, approval with modifications, or disapproval.

If the filing was approved with modifications, the order shall state that the filing shall take effect after the modifications are made and approved by the commissioner. If the filing was disapproved, the order shall state that the filing shall not take effect.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The inability to approve 1 or more rating classes of business within a line of business because of a requirement to submit further data or because a request for a hearing under section 613 has been granted shall not delay the approval of rates by the commissioner which could otherwise be approved or the implementation of rates already approved, unless the approval or implementation would affect the consideration of the unapproved classes of business.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Information furnished under subsection (1) in support of a nongroup rate filing shall include the following:</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 612.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Upon receipt of a rate filing under section 610, the commissioner immediately shall notify each person who has requested in writing notice of those filings within the previous 2 years, specifying the nature and extent of the proposed rate revision and identifying the location, time, and place where the copy of the rate filing described in section 610(7) shall be open to public inspection and copying. The notice shall also state that if the person has standing, the person shall have, upon making a written request for a hearing within 60 days after receiving notice of the rate filing, an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing under section 613 to determine whether the proposed rates meet the requirements of this act. The request shall identify the issues which the requesting party asserts are involved, what portion of the rate filing is requested to be heard, and how the party has standing. The corporation shall place advertisements giving notice, containing the information specified above, in at least 1 newspaper which serves each geographic area in which significant numbers of subscribers reside.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The commissioner may charge a fee for providing, pursuant to subsection (1), a copy of the rate filing described in section 610(7). The commissioner may charge a fee for providing a copy of the entire filing to a person whose request for a hearing has been granted by the commissioner pursuant to section 613. The fee shall be limited to actual mailing costs and to the actual incremental cost of duplication, including labor and the cost of deletion and separation of information as provided in section 14 of Act No. 442 of the Public Acts of 1976, being section 15.244 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. Copies of the filing may be provided free of charge or at a reduced charge if the commissioner determines that a waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because the furnishing of a copy of the filing will primarily benefit the general public. In calculating the costs under this subsection, the commissioner shall not attribute more than the hourly wage of the lowest paid, full-time clerical employee of the insurance bureau to the cost of labor incurred in duplication and mailing and to the cost of separation and deletion. The commissioner shall use the most economical means available to provide copies of a rate filing.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 613.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the request for a hearing under this section is with regard to a rate filing not yet acted upon under section 610(2)(a), no such action shall be taken by the commissioner until after the hearing has been completed. However, the commissioner shall proceed to act upon those portions of a rate filing upon which no hearing has been requested. Within 15 days after receipt of a request for a hearing, the commissioner shall determine if the person has standing. If the commissioner determines that the person has standing, the person may have access to the entire filing subject to the same confidentiality requirements as the commissioner under section 604, and shall be subject to the penalty provision of section 604(5). Upon determining that the person has standing, the commissioner shall immediately appoint an independent hearing officer before whom the hearing shall be held. In appointing an independent hearing officer, the commissioner shall select a person qualified to conduct hearings, who has experience or education in the area of health care corporation or insurance rate determination and finance, and who is not otherwise associated financially with a health care corporation or a health care provider. The person selected shall not be currently or actively employed by this state. For purposes of this subsection, an employee of an educational institution shall not be considered to be employed by this state. For purposes of this section, a person has "standing" if any of the following circumstances exist:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The person is, or there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person could be, aggrieved by the proposed rate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The person is acting on behalf of 1 or more named persons described in subdivision (a).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The person is the commissioner, the attorney general, or the health care corporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Not more than 30 days after receipt of a request for a hearing, and upon not less than 15 days' notice to all parties, the hearing shall be commenced. Each party to the hearing shall be given a reasonable opportunity for discovery before and throughout the course of the hearing. However, the hearing officer may terminate discovery at any time, for good cause shown. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing pursuant to the administrative procedures act. The hearing shall be conducted in an expeditious manner. At the hearing, the burden of proving compliance with this act shall be upon the health care corporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In rendering a proposal for a decision, the hearing officer shall consider the factors prescribed in section 609.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Within 30 days after receipt of the hearing officer's proposal for decision, the commissioner shall by order render a decision which shall include a statement of findings.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The commissioner shall withdraw an order of approval or approval with modifications if the commissioner finds that the filing no longer meets the requirements of this act.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 614.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Not less than 75 days after a filing is received, as provided in section 610, the health care corporation may petition the commissioner, who shall make a determination with respect to interim rates and shall order interim rates in the amount prescribed in subsection (2). Interim rates shall not be implemented if the commissioner finds that the health care corporation has substantially contributed to the delay or that the health care corporation has not provided information requested by the commissioner relative to a determination under this section. The interim rate determination shall not be a contested case under chapter 4 of the administrative procedures act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The commissioner shall grant an interim rate, in an amount as determined by the commissioner, if the commissioner makes a finding that the corporation has made a convincing showing that there is probable cause to believe that the failure to grant the interim rate will result in an underwriting loss for that line of business for the period for which rates are being requested. As used in this subsection, "underwriting loss" means the difference between income from current rates plus investment income, and projected claims plus projected administrative expenses.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the final rate determination results in approval of a lower rate, appropriate refunds or adjustments, as determined by the commissioner, shall be made to reflect payments made in excess of the approved rate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The order establishing an interim rate adjustment made pursuant to this section shall be limited to adjusting rates for certificates then in effect, and shall not be used to alter certificates or implement new certificates.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   This section shall apply only to rates subject to section 608(1) for which a hearing has been requested.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a document required or permitted to be filed with the commissioner under this act substantially conforms to the requirements of this act, the commissioner shall endorse upon it the word "filed" with the commissioner's official title and the dates of receipt and of filing, and shall file and index the document or a reproduction of the document pursuant to the records media act in his or her office. If so requested at the time of delivery of the document to his or her office, the commissioner shall include the hour of filing in his or her endorsement on the document.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the commissioner fails promptly to file a document, other than an annual report or a supplemental statement, submitted for filing under this act, the commissioner, within 10 days after receipt from the person submitting the document for filing of a written request for the filing of the document, shall give written notice of the refusal to file to that person, specifying the reasons for the failure to file the document. From the disapproval, the person may seek judicial review pursuant to sections 103, 104, and 106 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, being sections 24.303, 24.304, and 24.306 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a document relating to a health care corporation filed with the commissioner under this act is an inaccurate record of the corporation action referred to in the document or was defectively or erroneously executed, the document may be corrected by filing with the commissioner a certificate of correction on behalf of the corporation. A certificate, entitled "certificate of correction of . . . (correct title of document and name of corporation)" shall be signed as provided in this act with respect to the document being corrected and shall be filed with the commissioner. The certificate shall set forth the name of the corporation, the date the document to be corrected was filed by the commissioner, the provision in the document as corrected or eliminated, and, if the execution was defective, the proper execution. The corrected document is effective in its corrected form as of its original filing date except as to a person who relied upon the inaccurate portion of the document and was, as a result of the inaccurate portion of the document, adversely affected by the correction.</DIV>

As part of the application, the applicant shall include the results from a completed autism diagnostic observation schedule or the results from any other annual development evaluation and documentation verifying those paid claims for which they are seeking reimbursement under this program.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as provided in subsection (3)(a), a request for an external review under section 11 or 13 must not be made until the covered person has exhausted the health carrier's internal grievance process provided for by law.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A statement informing the covered person of all of the following:</div>

An institution may include a hospital, nursing home, convalescent center, mental health or psychiatric facility, or jail, prison, or other correctional facility. An adult foster care home, a home for the aged, or an assisted living facility is not an institution for purposes of determining eligibility under this section.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The department shall provide quarterly reports to the senate and house appropriations committees, and the senate and house fiscal agencies, that include quantified data as to the number of program applicants and enrollees, the amount of expenditures, and the number of enrollees subsequently found eligible for medicaid. Each report shall also contain an estimate of whether or not the current rate of expenditures will exceed the existing amount of money appropriated for the EPIC program in the current fiscal year. If the estimate indicates that the program would end the year in deficit, the department and the department of management and budget shall take 1 or more of the following actions:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Request a supplemental appropriation for the EPIC program.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Request a transfer of spending authority from any surplus appropriation within the department.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Suspend further enrollment in the EPIC program.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Increase copayments for new applicants. In no case shall an adjustment in program cost sharing result in a cost to an eligible senior in excess of 5% of the eligible senior's household income.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 9.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The program created by this act is not an entitlement. Benefits are limited to the level supported by the money explicitly appropriated in this or other acts for the EPIC program.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as allowed in section 3(4), the EPIC program is a payer of last resort. If the federal government establishes a pharmaceutical assistance program that covers EPIC eligible seniors under medicare or another program, the EPIC program shall cover only eligible costs not covered by the federal program. This subsection does not require payment by a local prescription drug discount program or a local emergency prescription drug assistance program for a prescription drug covered under the EPIC program.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The EPIC program shall utilize an automated pharmacy claims adjudication and prospective drug utilization review system. This automated system shall contain those edits necessary to reduce the risk of adverse drug reactions in the enrolled population.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The pharmacy dispensing fee payable under the EPIC program shall be equal to the current medicaid dispensing fee.</DIV>
