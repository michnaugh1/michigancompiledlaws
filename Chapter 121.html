<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If on the vote being canvassed in each city, village or township, the result is determined to be in favor of the incorporation, the city clerk in the case of cities, the village clerk in the case of villages, and the township clerk in the case of townships, each shall file with the secretary of state and with the county clerk of the county in which the city, village or township is located, a certified copy of the resolution of their legislative body indicating its desire to become a part of the authority, a certified copy of the notice of election at which the question was submitted to the electors, and a certified copy of the canvassing resolution showing that the incorporation proposition was approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon, which resolution shall also give the number of votes cast on the proposition and the number cast for and against the same. From the date of the filing, the authority shall be deemed to be duly and legally incorporated under the provisions of this act if the total current state equalized valuation of such units of government so filing shall be $200,000,000.00 or more. If the electors of 1 or more cities, villages or townships vote against becoming a part of the authority, such fact shall not defeat the incorporation if the incorporation was approved by the electors of any 2 or more remaining cities, villages or townships having a current state equalized valuation of $200,000,000.00 or more; but the remaining cities, villages or townships shall constitute the boundaries of the authority, and a part thereof, if the legislative bodies of the remaining units of government, by resolution, approve the incorporation. Copies of the resolutions shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state and the county clerk of the county in which the units of government are situated. The incorporated authority shall then be known and designated as “The charter water authority of the (name cities, villages and townships becoming a part thereof), county (or counties) of .................... , Michigan” unless the governing body of the authority adopts a distinctive name for the authority, and files it in the office of the secretary of state.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 6.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The incorporated authority shall be directed and governed by a board of commissioners appointed as herein provided. The legislative body of each city, village or township constituting a part of the authority, within 30 days after the incorporation of the authority, shall elect a commissioner as its representative on the board of commissioners. The commissioner from each city, village or township shall have 1 vote. In determining the voting strength of a commissioner from a township in which is located a village or villages which are also constituent members of the authority, there shall be subtracted from the state equalized valuation of such township that proportion of such state equalized valuation of that township which the total assessed valuation of such member village or villages bears to the total assessed valuation of such township as a whole, as determined by the township board of review. In determining the voting strength of a commissioner from a village, such village shall be deemed to have a state equalized valuation equal to that proportion of the state equalized valuation of the whole township in which such village is located as the assessed valuation of such village, as determined by the township board of review, bears to the assessed valuation of the whole township in which such village is located, as last determined by the township board of review. In addition to such 1 vote, the commissioner from each city, village or township having a state equalized valuation in excess of $40,000,000.00 shall have 1 cumulative and additional vote for each $40,000,000.00 or any part thereof of state equalized valuation for the city, village or township he represents in excess of $40,000,000.00. Each commissioner's voting strength shall be determined initially as of the date of incorporation of the authority, and shall be redetermined every 5 years thereafter. The state equalized valuation for each city, village or township shall be determined initially and redetermined by the latest official figures applicable to that city, village or township. The commissioners shall serve for 4 years or until their successors are appointed.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The authority shall levy each year a sufficient tax, taking into account the probable delinquency in tax collections, to pay the principal and interest on all bonds lawfully issued by the authority under the provisions of this act, maturing prior to the next tax collection period. Except as otherwise provided by law, the tax for the purpose of paying the bonded indebtedness shall be unlimited as to rate or amount. The tax rate shall be uniform for all territory comprising the authority.

All the taxes shall be assessed, levied, collected, and returned in the same manner as county taxes under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157, and shall have the same priority rights and bear the same interest and penalties as county taxes. In the levy and collection of the taxes, the tax collecting officials of the cities and townships comprising the authority, and the county treasurers in the event the taxes are returned delinquent, shall be considered to be acting as agents for and on behalf of the authority.
