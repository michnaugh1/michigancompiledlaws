</P>
<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), in each village, the following officers shall be elected: a president, 6 trustees, 1 clerk, and 1 treasurer. The president and trustees constitute the council. In all votes for which not less than a majority vote of council is required, the calculation of the number of votes required shall be based on the maximum number that constitutes council.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The council by a vote of 2/3 of the members of council may provide by ordinance for the reduction in the number of trustees to 4 or for the election of all trustees at the same election for 2-year terms at the first possible election after 2004 who with the president shall constitute the council, and may provide by ordinance for the method of changing from 2-year staggered terms to 4-year staggered terms. If village trustees are elected biennially for staggered 4-year terms, the ordinance shall as nearly as possible maintain staggered terms and provide for an equal number of seats to be filled at each election. The ordinance may extend but shall not shorten the term of an incumbent trustee. The ordinance may extend a prospective term. The ordinance shall not shorten or eliminate a prospective term unless the nomination deadline for that term is not less than 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance. An ordinance adopted under this subsection shall satisfy both of the following conditions:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The ordinance shall be voted on and adopted at a meeting that occurs not less than 10 days after the initial meeting or public hearing at which the ordinance was considered.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Notice of each meeting at which the ordinance is considered indicating that an ordinance reducing the size of the council or to change the time of election of the trustees comprising the council will be 1 of the subjects of the meeting shall be published not less than 10 days before the meeting in a newspaper of general circulation in the village.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The council by a vote of 2/3 of the members of council may provide by ordinance for the nomination by the president and the appointment by the council of the clerk or the treasurer or both for such a term as the ordinance may provide. The ordinance shall apply beginning with the first term the nomination deadline for which would have been not less than 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance or shall apply when the office is vacated, whichever occurs first.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The council shall provide that an ordinance adopted under subsection (2) or (3) takes effect 45 days after the date of adoption unless a petition signed by not less than 10% of the registered electors of the village is filed with the village clerk within the 45-day period, in which case the ordinance takes effect upon approval at an election held on the question. Notice of the delayed effect of the ordinance and the right of petition under this subsection shall be published separately at the same time, and in the same manner, as the ordinance is published pursuant to section 4 of chapter VI. The village clerk shall verify the signatures on the petitions. If a petition bearing the required number of valid signatures of electors is filed, the question of adoption of the ordinance shall be submitted at the next general or special election. The ballot language for the question shall be prepared by the village clerk, unless the question concerns the appointment of the clerk under subsection (2), in which case the ballot language shall be prepared by the village council.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A village that has adopted an ordinance reducing the number of trustees to 4 or providing for the appointment by the council of the clerk or treasurer may increase the number of trustees to 6 or provide for the election of the clerk or treasurer by the same process as provided in subsection (2) or (3), respectively, and in subsection (4).</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A vacancy occurring in the office of president, trustee, or any other elective office shall be filled by appointment by the council, and the appointee shall hold office until the next regular village election. All vacancies in any other office shall be filled by the president, by and with the consent of the council. If by reason of removal, death, resignation, or otherwise, the membership of the council is reduced to less than a quorum, the remaining council members shall call a special election for the purpose of filling all vacancies in the office of trustee, if a petition signed by not less than 10% of the qualified voters of the village is filed with the village clerk within 10 days after the vacancy or vacancies occur. If a petition is not filed within the time stated, then the remaining council members may either call a special election, or may appoint a sufficient number of trustees to constitute with the members in office a quorum of the council, who shall then fill the remaining vacancies as provided in this section. If all the officers and trustees of a village have died or moved from the village, and no successors have been elected or appointed to fill the vacancies, the township clerk of the township within which the village is situated shall, upon petition of 10% of the qualified voters residing in the village, call a special election for the election of the officers and trustees of the village to be held on a regular election date as established under section 641 of the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.641. The township shall perform all of the other duties with respect to the election as the village might have done had the vacancies not existed, including the preparation of ballots, the appointment of election inspectors, the counting and canvassing of the ballots, and the certification of the persons elected to the offices for which the election was held. The expenses of the election shall be paid by the village as provided in section 642 of the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.642.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 8.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The council may employ a village manager.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The manager shall serve at the pleasure of the council.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The council may enter into an employment contract with a village manager for a period extending beyond the terms of the members of council but not exceeding 6 years. An employment contract with a manager shall be in writing and shall specify the compensation to be paid to the manager, any procedure for changing compensation, any fringe benefits, and any other conditions of employment. The contract shall state that the manager serves at the pleasure of the council. The contract may provide for severance pay or other benefits in the event the employment of the manager is terminated at the pleasure of the council. Unless otherwise provided by ordinance adopted under subsection (4), the council may assign to the manager only those powers and duties not required by law to be assigned to or performed by another official of the village.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The council may adopt an ordinance assigning to the manager an administrative duty imposed by this act on the council; an administrative duty imposed by this act on the village president; the authority to appoint, remove, direct, or supervise any employee or appointed official of the village; or supervisory responsibility over the accounting, budgeting, personnel, purchasing, and related management functions imposed by this act on the village clerk and the village treasurer. The council shall provide in the ordinance that the assignment becomes effective 45 days after the date of adoption and that if a petition signed by not less than 10% of the registered electors of the village is filed with the village clerk within the 45-day period, the ordinance shall not become effective until after the ordinance is approved at an election held on the question. Notice of the delayed effect of the ordinance and the right of petition under this subsection shall be published separately at the same time, and in the same manner, as the ordinance is published pursuant to section 4 of chapter VI. The village clerk shall compare the signatures on the petitions to the signatures of those electors as they appear on the appropriate registration cards. If a petition bearing the required number of valid signatures of electors is filed, the clerk shall perform the acts required for the submission of the question of adoption of the ordinance at the next general or special election. An ordinance adopted before December 2, 1985 that conforms substantially with the requirements of this subsection is valid to the same extent as if the ordinance had been adopted on or after December 2, 1985.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An action for the violation of an ordinance need not state or set forth the ordinance, or the provisions of the ordinance in a complaint, warrant, process, or pleading, but shall recite the ordinance's title or subject and the ordinance's section number.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   It is a sufficient statement of the cause of action in a complaint or warrant to set forth substantially, and with reasonable certainty, as to time and place, the act complained of, and to allege the act to be in violation of an ordinance of the village, referring to the ordinance by its title and the section number and effective date.

However, the road or highway bridges within the limits of a village laid out by any authority other than the village, shall be built, controlled, and kept in repair by the county or this state, whichever has jurisdiction. All other bridges in the village shall be built, controlled, and kept in repair by the village.</DIV>

The special assessment is subject to review after proper notice has been given as in all other cases of special assessments provided for by law. When confirmed, the assessment shall be a lien upon the lot or premises the same as other special assessments, and the council shall order the treasurer of the village to spread the amount, together with the penalty, upon the roll as a special assessment upon the lot or premises. The assessment shall be collected in the same manner as other village taxes.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The council of a village may provide by resolution for the acquisition or financing of energy conservation improvements to be made to village facilities or infrastructure and may pay for the improvements or the financing or refunding of the improvements from operating funds of the village or from the savings that result from the energy conservation improvements. Energy conservation improvements may include, but are not limited to, heating, ventilating, or air-conditioning system improvements, fenestration improvements, roof improvements, the installation of any insulation, the installation or repair of heating, ventilating, or air-conditioning controls, entrance or exit way closures, information technology improvements associated with an energy conservation improvement, and municipal utility improvements associated with an energy conservation improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The council of a village may acquire, finance, or refund 1 or more of the energy conservation improvements described in subsection (1) by installment contract, which may include a lease-purchase agreement described in subsection (5), or may borrow money and issue notes for the purpose of securing funds for the improvements or may enter into contracts in which the cost of the energy conservation improvements is paid from a portion of the savings that result from the energy conservation improvements. These contractual agreements may provide that the cost of the energy conservation improvements are paid only if the energy savings are sufficient to cover their cost. An installment contract, a lease-purchase agreement described in subsection (5), or notes issued pursuant to this subsection shall extend for a period of time not to exceed 20 years from the date of the final completion of the energy conservation improvements or the useful life of the aggregate energy conservation improvements, whichever is less. Notes issued pursuant to this subsection shall be full faith and credit, tax limited obligations of the village, payable from tax levies and the general fund as pledged by the council of the village. The notes are subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821. A lease-purchase agreement issued pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821, and shall not be a municipal security or a debt as those terms are defined in that act. This subsection does not limit in any manner the borrowing or bonding authority of a village as provided by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Prior to entering into a contract for energy conservation improvements under this section, the village council shall determine the following information and, within 60 days of the completion of the improvements, shall report the following information to the department of treasury: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Name of each facility to which an improvement is made and a description of the energy conservation improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Actual energy consumption during the 12-month period before commencement of the improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Project costs and expenditures, including the total of all lease payments over the duration of the lease-purchase agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Estimated annual energy savings, including projected savings over the duration of the installment contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If energy conservation improvements are made as provided in this section, the village council shall report to the department of treasury, by July 1 of each of the 5 years after the improvements are completed, only the actual annual energy consumption of each facility to which improvements are made. The forms for the reports required by this section shall be furnished by the department of treasury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An installment contract described in this section may include a lease-purchase agreement, which may be a multiyear contractual obligation that provides for automatic renewal unless positive action is taken by the legislative body to terminate that contract. Payments under a lease-purchase agreement shall be a current operating expense subject to annual appropriations of funds by the legislative body and shall obligate the legislative body only for those sums payable during the fiscal year of contract execution or any renewal year thereafter. The legislative body may make payments under a lease-purchase agreement from any legally available funds or from a combination of energy or operational savings, capital contributions, future replacement costs avoided, or billable revenue enhancements that result from energy conservation improvements, provided that the legislative body has determined that those funds are sufficient to cover, in aggregate over the full term of the contractual agreement, the cost of the energy conservation improvements. The lease-purchase agreement will terminate immediately and absolutely and without further obligation on the part of the legislative body at the close of the fiscal year in which it was executed or renewed or at such time as appropriated and otherwise unobligated funds are no longer available to satisfy the obligations of the legislative body under the lease-purchase agreement. During the term of the lease-purchase agreement, the legislative body shall be the vested owner of the energy conservation improvements and may grant a security interest in the energy conservation improvements to the provider of the lease-purchase agreement. Upon the termination of the lease-purchase agreement and the satisfaction of the obligations of the legislative body, the provider of the lease-purchase agreement shall release its security interest in the energy conservation improvements.</div>

Taxes collected on or before September 14 in each year are not subject to interest. Taxes collected after September 14 of any year bear interest at the rate imposed by the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, on delinquent property tax levies that became a lien in the same year. The village taxes that are collected by a village are subject to the same fees and charges the village may impose under section 44 of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.44. All interest and property tax administration fees that are imposed before the date these taxes are returned delinquent and that are attributable to village taxes belong to the village. Interest and, to the extent permitted by section 44 of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.44, fees must be included in the unpaid tax rolls or the delinquent tax rolls returned to the county treasurer on September 15, or not later than March 1 if the warrant is extended.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Taxes collected by the village must be returned delinquent to the county treasurer on September 15 unless the governing body of the village by resolution determines that the village taxes will be returned to the county treasurer on the same date that county taxes are returned delinquent for collection. The resolution must be adopted on or before June 1 to be effective as to the immediately succeeding summer tax levy and, subject to this qualification, is effective as to all subsequent tax levies until revoked by resolution of the governing body of the village. A revoking resolution must be adopted on or before June 1 to be effective as to the immediately succeeding summer tax levy and, subject to this qualification, is effective as to all subsequent tax levies. A resolution of either kind must be forwarded to the county treasurer before the July 1 tax levy to which it first applies. A village collecting delinquent taxes under this section shall specify in the village tax bill for each year or a separate enclosure with the tax bill where delinquent taxes are to be paid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the unpaid village taxes are returned to the county treasurer before March 1 of the year following the levy of the village taxes, the county treasurer shall add to those taxes fees and interest in the same amount as would have been added if collected by the village treasurer. As of March 1, the accumulated interest and the fees on those taxes that may be imposed and returned delinquent must be added to and become a part of the village tax subject to the interest and fees charged by the county treasurer on the delinquent taxes under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Within 1 week after the expiration of the time limited in the warrant for the collection of the taxes levied on the roll, or within 1 week after the time to which the warrant may have been renewed or extended, if the treasurer has been unable to collect any of the taxes on the roll on real property, the treasurer shall return all unpaid taxes on real property to the county treasurer in the same manner and with like effect as returns by township treasurers. The taxes returned must be collected in the same manner as other taxes returned to the county treasurer are collected under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, with the same rate of interest and fees. All taxes on real property returned as delinquent are and remain a lien on the property until paid. The county treasurer at the time that he or she returns to the department of treasury delinquent taxes assessed under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, shall also return all village taxes that were returned delinquent to his or her office and that remain unpaid on March 1 of the year of the return. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If any greater amount is required in any year for any lawful purpose than can otherwise be raised by the council under this chapter, the amount may be raised by tax or loan, or partly by tax and partly by loan. If approved by a majority vote of the electors at an annual or special village election, the council may levy a tax that, in any year, must not exceed 2% of the assessed valuation of the real and personal property within the village, as shown by the last preceding assessment roll of the village.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The amount of indebtedness incurred by the issue of bonds or otherwise, including existing indebtedness, must not exceed 10% of the assessed valuation of the real and personal property within the village subject to taxation as shown by the last preceding assessment roll of the village. Bonds issued in anticipation of the collection of special assessments even though the bonds are a general obligation of the village, motor vehicle highway fund bonds even though they are a general obligation of the village, revenue bonds, or bonds issued or contract or assessment obligations incurred to comply with an order of the department of environmental quality or a court of competent jurisdiction, even though they are a general obligation of the village and bonds issued or contract or assessment obligations incurred for water supply, sewage, drainage, or refuse disposal necessary to protect the public health by abating pollution even though they are a general obligation of the village, are not included in this limitation. Money on hand in a sinking fund limited to the payment of indebtedness may be treated as a reduction of the indebtedness to that extent. In case of fire, flood, or other calamity requiring an emergency fund for the relief of the inhabitants of the village, or for the repairing or rebuilding of any of its municipal buildings, works, bridges, or streets, the council may borrow money due in not more than 3 years and in an amount not exceeding 1/4 of 1% of the taxable valuation of the village, notwithstanding that the loan may increase the indebtedness of the village beyond the limitations fixed by this section. If a village is authorized to acquire or operate a public utility, the village may issue mortgage bonds therefor beyond the general limit of bonded indebtedness prescribed by this section. The mortgage bonds issued beyond the limit of general indebtedness prescribed by this section must not impose any liability upon the village, but must be secured only upon the property and revenues of the public utility, including its franchise, stating the terms upon which, in case of foreclosure, the purchaser may operate the public utility; which franchise must not extend for a period of more than 20 years from the date of the sale of the utility and franchise on foreclosure. All bonds issued, or contract or assessment obligations incurred, before January 30, 1974 are validated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In computing the net indebtedness for the purposes of subsection (2), there may be added to the assessed value of real and personal property in a village for a fiscal year an amount equal to the assessed value equivalent of certain village revenues as determined under this subsection. The assessed value equivalent must be calculated by dividing the sum of the following amounts by the village's millage rate for the fiscal year:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The amount paid or the estimated amount required to be paid by the state to the village during the village's fiscal year for the village's use under the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921, and the amount of any eligible reimbursement to the village under the local community stabilization authority act, 2014 PA 86, MCL 123.1341 to 123.1362, except any amount distributed under section 17(4)(c) of the local community stabilization authority act, 2014 PA 86, MCL 123.1357, in excess of the village's qualified loss. The department of treasury shall certify these amounts upon request. As used in this subdivision, "qualified loss" means that term as defined in section 5 of the local community stabilization authority act, 2014 PA 86, MCL 123.1345.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The amount levied by the village for its own use during the village's fiscal year from the specific tax levied under 1974 PA 198, MCL 207.551 to 207.572.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The amount levied by the village for its own use during the village's fiscal year from the specific tax levied under the commercial redevelopment act, 1978 PA 255, MCL 207.651 to 207.668.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   To exercise the powers granted by section 1 of this chapter, the council shall adopt a resolution declaring that it is expedient for the village to acquire by purchase or construction, as applicable, works to supply the village with electric or other lights, and shall make and record in their proceedings an estimate of the expense.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The question of financing the estimated amount or that part of the estimated amount not in excess of limitations on indebtedness of the village provided by law shall be submitted to the electors of the village at its regular election, or at a special election called for that purpose by the council as provided in this act. Approval of the proposal requires the affirmative vote of 2/3 of the electors voting at the election by ballot.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the voters approve financing a part of the estimated amount not in excess of the limitations on indebtedness of the village, the council shall not incur any indebtedness for lighting works on the general faith and credit of the village until the charter is amended to permit the issuance of mortgage bonds on the proposed lighting plant, its revenues and franchise, in excess of the general limitations on indebtedness as provided by this act, in an amount equal to the difference between the indebtedness authorized by this act, and the estimated amount.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 5.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   After lighting works have been purchased or constructed in the village as provided in this chapter, the council may raise and expend money to repair, alter, or extend the lighting works without submitting the question to the electors of the village. However, the sum to be so raised, in any 1 year, shall be included in, and shall not increase the total amount that the council is authorized to raise under section 1 of chapter IX.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Instead of raising the funds by tax, the council may, by a contract that does not impose a general obligation on the village, provide for repairs, alterations, or extensions of the lighting works. The contract shall provide for payment of the contract out of the net revenues which, after payment of obligations due, provision for payment of obligations to become due, and payment of legitimate and necessary operating and other expenses are available from the operation of the lighting works after completion of the repairs, alterations, or extensions. The contract shall provide for the retention of title to materials furnished in the seller until paid for in full. However, a contract made under this section does not deprive the people of the village of any right vested in them by the constitution or the laws of this state, grant a franchise or its operating equivalent, or convey title to property to any person not possessed of such title before the execution of the title retaining contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Instead of raising funds to repair, alter, or extend the lighting works by tax as provided by section 1 of chapter IX, or using funds available from the operation of the lighting works, as provided in this section, the council may borrow money and issue bonds in the manner provided in section 3 of this chapter for the acquisition or construction of lighting works, except that approval of the proposal requires the affirmative vote of 3/5 of the electors voting on the question.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   After the village clerk records the final judgment and verdict as provided in section 30 of this chapter, the proper and necessary proceedings may be taken by the council for the collection of the sum awarded by the jury.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the council believes that real estate in the village in the vicinity of the proposed improvement will be benefited by the improvement, the council may, by an entry in its minutes, determine that the whole or any just proportion of the compensation awarded by the jury, and of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the proceedings, be assessed upon the owners or occupants of real estate determined to be benefited. The council shall, by resolution, fix and determine the district of the village benefited, and specify the amount to be assessed upon the owners or occupants of the benefited real estate. In determining the amount of such costs and expenses, the council may include all costs and expenses incurred or paid for jurors' fees, expenses of abstracts, all surveys and maps, and all other necessary expenses. The amount of the benefit thus ascertained shall be assessed upon the owners or occupants of the benefited real estate, in proportion, as nearly as may be, to the advantage which each such lot or parcel is deemed to acquire by the improvement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The assessment shall be made and the amount levied and collected in the same manner and by the same officers and proceedings, as near as may be, provided in sections 31 to 35 of chapter VIII. The assessment roll, when ratified and confirmed by the council, shall be final and conclusive and prima facie evidence of the regularity and legality of all proceedings prior thereto, and each assessment shall be a lien on the premises on which it is assessed until the assessment is paid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Whatever amount or portion of such awarded compensation, costs, and expenses is not raised by special assessment shall be assessed, levied, and collected upon the taxable real estate of the village, the same as other general taxes are assessed and collected. The village may purchase assessed premises or any portion sold for nonpayment of the amount assessed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If there is on the private property taken a building or other structure, it may be sold by or under the direction of the council. The amount produced by the sale shall belong and be paid to the fund for paying the compensation awarded for the property taken, and the council shall cause such amount to be credited and applied in reduction pro rata of the assessment and apportionment made to pay for the property taken.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Not more than 14 days after the petition is filed, the township clerk shall verify the signatures and determine the sufficiency of the petition. Unless the council proceeds under sections 23 to 23i of this chapter, if the clerk determines that the petition is sufficient, the question of the disincorporation of the village shall appear on the ballot at the next general or special election to be held in the village, subject to the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.1 to 168.992.

The notice of close of registration shall include the ballot language of the proposal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The results of the election on the proposed disincorporation shall be canvassed by the board of county canvassers of the county in which the village is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The disincorporation of the village shall take place under this section only if 2/3 of the electors voting on the questions vote "yes". If the disincorporation is approved, the council shall immediately cause a transcript of all the proceedings in the case to be certified to both of the following:</div>
