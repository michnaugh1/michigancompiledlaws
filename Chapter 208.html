<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) "Business activity" means a transfer of legal or equitable title to or rental of property, whether real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible, or the performance of services, or a combination thereof, made or engaged in, or caused to be made or engaged in, whether in intrastate, interstate, or foreign commerce, with the object of gain, benefit, or advantage, whether direct or indirect, to the taxpayer or to others, but does not include the services rendered by an employee to his or her employer or services as a director of a corporation. Although an activity of a taxpayer may be incidental to another or to other of his or her business activities, each activity shall be considered to be business engaged in within the meaning of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) "Business income" means that part of federal taxable income derived from business activity. For a partnership or S corporation, business income includes payments and items of income and expense that are attributable to business activity of the partnership or S corporation and separately reported to the partners or shareholders. For an organization that is a mutual or cooperative electric company exempt under section 501(c)(12) of the internal revenue code, business income equals the organization's excess or deficiency of revenues over expenses as reported to the federal government by those organizations exempt from the federal income tax under the internal revenue code, less capital credits paid to members of that organization, less income attributed to equity in another organization's net income, and less income resulting from a charge approved by a state or federal regulatory agency that is restricted for a specified purpose and refundable if it is not used for the specified purpose. For a tax-exempt person, business income means only that part of federal taxable income derived from unrelated business activity. For a person that is organized exclusively to conduct investment activity and that does not conduct investment activity for any person other than an individual or a person related to that individual and for a common trust fund established under the collective investments funds act, 1941 PA 174, MCL 555.101 to 555.113, business income excludes income derived from investment activity unless the activity is in the regular course of the person's trade or business. For purposes of this subsection, a person is related to an individual if that person is a spouse, brother or sister, whether of the whole or half blood or by adoption, ancestor, lineal descendant of that individual or related person, or a trust benefiting that individual or 1 more persons related to that individual. For an individual, estate, or person organized for estate or gift planning purposes, business income is that part of federal taxable income derived from transactions, activities, and sources in the regular course of the person's trade or business, including the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) All income from tangible and intangible property if the acquisition, rental, lease, management, or disposition of the property constitutes integral parts of the person's regular trade or business operations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Gains or losses incurred in the person's trade or business from stock and securities of any foreign or domestic corporation and dividend and interest income.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Income derived from isolated sales, leases, assignments, licenses, divisions, or other infrequently occurring dispositions, transfers, or transactions involving tangible, intangible, or real property if the property is or was used in the person's trade or business operation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Income derived from the sale of an interest in a business that constitutes an integral part of the person's regular trade or business.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Income derived from the lease or rental of real property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Income not included in business income for an individual, estate, or person organized for estate or gift planning purposes includes, but is not limited to, the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Income from investment activity, including interest, dividends, royalties, and gains from an investment portfolio or retirement account, if the investment activity is not part of the person's trade or business.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Income from the disposition of tangible, intangible, or real property held for personal use and enjoyment, such as a personal residence or personal assets.</div>

The deduction under subsection (2)(i) is intended to flow through and reduce the surcharge imposed and levied under section 281. For purposes of the calculation of the deduction under subsection (2)(i), a book-tax difference shall only be used once in the calculation of the deduction arising from the taxpayer's business income tax base under this section and once in the calculation of the deduction arising from the taxpayer's modified gross receipts tax base under section 203. The adjustment under subsection (2)(i) shall be calculated without regard to the federal effect of the deduction. If the adjustment under subsection (2)(i) is greater than the taxpayer's business income tax base, any adjustment that is unused may be carried forward and applied as an adjustment to the taxpayer's business income tax base before apportionment in future years. In order to claim this deduction, the department may require the taxpayer to report the amount of this deduction on a form as prescribed by the department that is to be filed on or after the date that the first quarterly return and estimated payment are due under this act.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Deduct any available business loss incurred after December 31, 2007. As used in this subsection, "business loss" means a negative business income taxable amount after allocation or apportionment. For purposes of this subsection, a taxpayer that acquires the assets of another corporation in a transaction described under section 381(a)(1) or (2) of the internal revenue code may deduct any business loss attributable to that distributor or transferor corporation. The business loss shall be carried forward to the year immediately succeeding the loss year as an offset to the allocated or apportioned business income tax base, then successively to the next 9 taxable years following the loss year or until the loss is used up, whichever occurs first, but for not more than 10 taxable years after the loss year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Deduct any gain from the sale of any residential rental units in this state to a qualified affordable housing project that enters an agreement to operate the residential rental units as rent restricted units for a minimum of 15 years. If the qualified affordable housing project does not agree to operate all of the residential rental units as rent restricted units, the deduction under this subsection is limited to an amount equal to the gain from the sale multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of those residential rental units purchased that are to be operated as a rent restricted unit and the denominator is the number of all residential rental units purchased. In order to claim this deduction, the department may require the taxpayer and the qualified affordable housing project to report the amount of this deduction on a form as prescribed by the department that is to be signed by both the taxpayer and the qualified affordable housing project and filed with the taxpayer's annual return. The department shall record a lien against the property subject to the operation agreement for the total amount of the deduction allowed under this subsection. The department shall notify the qualified affordable housing project of the maximum amount of the lien that the qualified affordable housing project may be liable for if the qualified affordable housing project fails to qualify and operate as provided in the operation agreement within 15 years after the purchase. The lien shall become payable in an amount as provided under this subsection to the state by the qualified affordable housing project if the qualified affordable housing project fails to qualify as a qualified affordable housing project and fails to operate all or some of the residential rental units as rent restricted units in accordance with the operation agreement entered upon the purchase of those units within 15 years after the deduction is claimed by a taxpayer under this subsection. An amount equal to the product of 100% of the amount of the deduction allowed under this subsection multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the difference between 15 and the number of years the affordable housing project qualified and operated rent restricted units in accordance with the agreement and the denominator is 15, shall be added back to the tax liability of the qualified affordable housing project for the tax year that the qualified affordable housing project fails to comply with the agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Subject to the limitations provided in this subsection, for a person that is a qualified affordable housing project, deduct an amount equal to the product of that person's taxable income that is attributable to residential rental units in this state owned by the qualified affordable housing project multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of rent restricted units in this state owned by that qualified affordable housing project and the denominator of which is the number of all residential rental units in this state owned by the qualified affordable housing project. The amount of the deduction calculated under this subsection shall be reduced by the amount of limited dividends or other distributions made to the partners, members, or shareholders of the qualified affordable housing project. Taxable income that is attributable to residential rental units does not include income received by the management, construction, or development company for completion and operation of the project and those rental units.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a qualified affordable housing project no longer meets the requirements of subsection (9)(b) or fails to operate those residential rental units as rent restricted units in accordance with the operation agreement and the requirements of subsection (9)(c), the taxpayer is entitled to the deductions under subsections (6) and (7) as long as the qualified affordable housing project continues to offer some of the residential rental units purchased as rent restricted units in accordance with the operation agreement.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) For a financial institution, tax base means the financial institution's net capital. Net capital means equity capital as computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles less goodwill and the average daily book value of United States obligations and Michigan obligations. If the financial institution does not maintain its books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, net capital shall be computed in accordance with the books and records used by the financial institution, so long as the method fairly reflects the financial institution's net capital for purposes of the tax levied by this chapter. Net capital does not include up to 125% of the minimum regulatory capitalization requirements of a person subject to the tax imposed under chapter 2A.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Net capital shall be determined by adding the financial institution's net capital as of the close of the current tax year and preceding 4 tax years and dividing the resulting sum by 5. If a financial institution has not been in existence for a period of 5 tax years, net capital shall be determined by adding together the financial institution's net capital for the number of tax years the financial institution has been in existence and dividing the resulting sum by the number of years the financial institution has been in existence. For purposes of this section, a partial year shall be treated as a full year. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For a unitary business group of financial institutions, net capital calculated under this section does not include the investment of 1 member of the unitary business group in another member of that unitary business group.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) For purposes of this section, each of the following applies:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A change in identity, form, or place of organization of 1 financial institution shall be treated as if a single financial institution had been in existence for the entire tax year in which the change occurred and each tax year after the change.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The combination of 2 or more financial institutions into 1 shall be treated as if the constituent financial institutions had been a single financial institution in existence for the entire tax year in which the combination occurred and each tax year after the combination, and the book values and deductions for United States obligations and Michigan obligations of the constituent institutions shall be combined. A combination shall include any acquisition required to be accounted for by the surviving financial institution in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or a statutory merger or consolidation.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Sales of the taxpayer in this state are determined as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Sales of tangible personal property are in this state if the property is shipped or delivered, or, in the case of electricity and gas, the contract requires the property to be shipped or delivered, to any purchaser within this state based on the ultimate destination at the point that the property comes to rest regardless of the free on board point or other conditions of the sales. Property stored in transit for 60 days or more prior to receipt by the purchaser or the purchaser's designee, or in the case of a dock sale not picked up for 60 days or more, is deemed to have come to rest at this ultimate destination. Property stored in transit for fewer than 60 days prior to receipt by the purchaser or the purchaser's designee, or in the case of a dock sale picked up before 60 days, is not deemed to have come to rest at this ultimate destination. For purposes of this subdivision:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) "Dock sale" means a sale in which the purchaser uses its own or rented vehicles, or makes arrangements with a carrier, to pick up the property at the seller's location.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) "Stored in transit" means storing, staging, forwarding, or consolidating activities undertaken for further shipment or transfer of the property to the purchaser or purchaser's designee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Receipts from the sale, lease, rental, or licensing of real property are in this state if that property is located in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Receipts from the lease or rental of tangible personal property are sales in this state to the extent that the property is utilized in this state. The extent of utilization of tangible personal property in this state is determined by multiplying the receipts by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property in this state during the lease or rental period in the tax year and the denominator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property everywhere during all lease or rental periods in the tax year. If the physical location of the property during the lease or rental period is unknown or cannot be determined, the tangible personal property is utilized in the state in which the property was located at the time the lease or rental payer obtained possession.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Receipts from the lease or rental of mobile transportation property owned by the taxpayer are in this state to the extent that the property is used in this state. The extent an aircraft will be deemed to be used in this state and the amount of receipts that is to be included in the numerator of this state's sales factor is determined by multiplying all the receipts from the lease or rental of the aircraft by a fraction, the numerator of the fraction is the number of landings of the aircraft in this state and the denominator of the fraction is the total number of landings of the aircraft. If the extent of the use of any transportation property within this state cannot be determined, then the receipts are in this state if the property has its principal base of operations in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Royalties and other income received for the use of or for the privilege of using intangible property, including patents, know-how, formulas, designs, processes, patterns, copyrights, trade names, service names, franchises, licenses, contracts, customer lists, computer software, or similar items, are attributed to the state in which the property is used by the purchaser. If the property is used in more than 1 state, the royalties or other income shall be apportioned to this state pro rata according to the portion of use in this state. If the portion of use in this state cannot be determined, the royalties or other income shall be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator. Intangible property is used in this state if the purchaser uses the intangible property or the rights to the intangible property in the regular course of its business operations in this state, regardless of the location of the purchaser's customers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Sales from the performance of services are in this state and attributable to this state as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all receipts from the performance of services are included in the numerator of the apportionment factor if the recipient of the services receives all of the benefit of the services in this state. If the recipient of the services receives some of the benefit of the services in this state, the receipts are included in the numerator of the apportionment factor in proportion to the extent that the recipient receives benefit of the services in this state.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Notwithstanding any other provision in this act, the credits provided in this section shall be taken before any other credit under this act. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (6), for the 2008 tax year, the total combined credit allowed under this section shall not exceed 50% of the tax liability imposed under this act before the imposition and levy of the surcharge under section 281. For the 2009 tax year and each tax year after 2009, the total combined credit allowed under this section shall not exceed 52% of the tax liability imposed under this act before the imposition and levy of the surcharge under section 281.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to the limitation in subsection (1), for the 2008 tax year a taxpayer may claim a credit against the tax imposed by this act equal to 0.296% of the taxpayer's compensation in this state. For the 2009 tax year and each tax year after 2009, subject to the limitation in subsection (1), a taxpayer may claim a credit against the tax imposed by this act equal to 0.370% of the taxpayer's compensation in this state. For purposes of this subsection, a taxpayer includes a person subject to the tax imposed under chapter 2A and a person subject to the tax imposed under chapter 2B. A professional employer organization shall not include payments by the professional employer organization to the officers and employees of a client of the professional employer organization whose employment operations are managed by the professional employer organization. A client may include payments by the professional employer organization to the officers and employees of the client whose employment operations are managed by the professional employer organization.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Subject to the limitation in subsection (1), for the 2008 tax year a taxpayer may claim a credit against the tax imposed by this act equal to 2.32% multiplied by the result of subtracting the sum of the amounts calculated under subdivisions (d), (e), and (f) from the sum of the amounts calculated under subdivisions (a), (b), and (c). Subject to the limitation in subsection (1), for the 2009 tax year and each tax year after 2009, a taxpayer may claim a credit against the tax imposed by this act equal to 2.9% multiplied by the result of subtracting the sum of the amounts calculated under subdivisions (d), (e), and (f) from the sum of the amounts calculated under subdivisions (a), (b), and (c):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Calculate the cost, including fabrication and installation, paid or accrued in the taxable year of tangible assets of a type that are, or under the internal revenue code will become, eligible for depreciation, amortization, or accelerated capital cost recovery for federal income tax purposes, provided that the assets are physically located in this state for use in a business activity in this state and are not mobile tangible assets.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Calculate the cost, including fabrication and installation, paid or accrued in the taxable year of mobile tangible assets of a type that are, or under the internal revenue code will become, eligible for depreciation, amortization, or accelerated capital cost recovery for federal income tax purposes. This amount shall be multiplied by the apportionment factor for the tax year as prescribed in chapter 3.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For tangible assets, other than mobile tangible assets, purchased or acquired for use outside of this state in a tax year beginning after December 31, 2007 and subsequently transferred into this state and purchased or acquired for use in a business activity, calculate the federal basis used for determining gain or loss as of the date the tangible assets were physically located in this state for use in a business activity plus the cost of fabrication and installation of the tangible assets in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If the cost of tangible assets described in subdivision (a) was paid or accrued in a tax year beginning after December 31, 2007, or before December 31, 2007 to the extent the credit is used and at the rate at which the credit was used under former 1975 PA 228 or to the extent the credit was used, and at the rate at which the credit was used under this act, calculate the gross proceeds or benefit derived from the sale or other disposition of the tangible assets minus the gain, multiplied by the apportionment factor for the taxable year as prescribed in chapter 3, and plus the loss, multiplied by the apportionment factor for the taxable year as prescribed in chapter 3 from the sale or other disposition reflected in federal taxable income. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the cost of mobile tangible assets described in subdivision (b) was paid or accrued in a tax year beginning after December 31, 2007, or before December 31, 2007 to the extent the credit is used and at the rate at which the credit was used under former 1975 PA 228 or to the extent the credit was used, and at the rate at which the credit was used under this act, calculate the gross proceeds or benefit derived from the sale or other disposition of the mobile tangible assets minus the gain and plus the loss from the sale or other disposition reflected in federal taxable income. This amount shall be multiplied by the apportionment factor for the tax year as prescribed in chapter 3.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) For assets purchased or acquired in a tax year beginning after December 31, 2007, or before December 31, 2007 to the extent the credit is used and at the rate at which the credit was used under former 1975 PA 228 or to the extent the credit was used, and at the rate at which the credit was used under this act, that were eligible for a credit under subdivision (a) or (c) and that were transferred out of this state, calculate the federal basis used for determining gain or loss as of the date of the transfer. For purposes of this subdivision, "transferred out of this state" means removal from this state of tangible assets, other than mobile tangible assets, by means other than sale or other disposition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) For a tax year in which the amount of the credit calculated under subsection (3) is negative, the absolute value of that amount is added to the taxpayer's tax liability for the tax year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A taxpayer that claims a credit under this section is not prohibited from claiming a credit under section 405. However, the taxpayer shall not claim a credit under this section and section 405 based on the same costs and expenses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For a taxpayer primarily engaged in furnishing electric and gas utility service that makes capital investments in electric and gas distribution assets for which a portion of the credit provided under subsection (3) would be denied for the 2008 tax year by reason of the 50% limitation of subsection (1), the 50% limitation on the total combined credit for the 2008 tax year provided in subsection (1) shall be increased by an amount not to exceed the lesser of the amount of the denied credit or 50% of the tax increase under this act accrued for financial reporting purposes due to the elimination of the deduction under section 168(k) of the internal revenue code by 2008 PA 434. Provided, however, that the total combined credit allowed under this section for the 2008 tax year shall not exceed 80% of the tax liability imposed under this act after the imposition and levy of the surcharge under section 281.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The historic resource is located in an incorporated local unit of government that does not have an ordinance under the local historic districts act, 1970 PA 169, MCL 399.201 to 399.215, and is located within the boundaries of an association that has been chartered under 1889 PA 39, MCL 455.51 to 455.72.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) The historic resource is subject to a historic preservation easement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For projects for which a certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued for a tax year beginning before January 1, 2009, if a qualified taxpayer is a partnership, limited liability company, or subchapter S corporation, the qualified taxpayer may assign all or any portion of a credit allowed under this section to its partners, members, or shareholders, based on the partner's, member's, or shareholder's proportionate share of ownership or based on an alternative method approved by the department. A credit assignment under this subsection is irrevocable and shall be made in the tax year in which a certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued. A qualified taxpayer may claim a portion of a credit and assign the remaining credit amount. A partner, member, or shareholder that is an assignee shall not subsequently assign a credit or any portion of a credit assigned to the partner, member, or shareholder under this subsection. A credit amount assigned under this subsection may be claimed against the partner's, member's, or shareholder's tax liability under this act or under the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.1 to 206.532. A credit assignment under this subsection shall be made on a form prescribed by the department. The qualified taxpayer and assignees shall attach a copy of the completed assignment form to the department in the tax year in which the assignment is made and attach a copy of the completed assignment form to the annual return required to be filed under this act for that tax year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) For projects for which a certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued for a tax year beginning after December 31, 2008, a qualified taxpayer may assign all or any portion of the credit allowed under this section. A credit assignment under this subsection is irrevocable and shall be made in the tax year in which a certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued. A qualified taxpayer may claim a portion of a credit and assign the remaining amount. If the qualified taxpayer both claims and assigns portions of the credit, the qualified taxpayer shall claim the portion it claims in the tax year in which a certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued pursuant to this section. An assignee may subsequently assign the credit or any portion of the credit assigned under this subsection to 1 or more assignees. An assignment or subsequent reassignment of a credit can be made in the year the certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued. A credit assignment or subsequent reassignment under this section shall be made on a form prescribed by the department. The department or its designee shall review and issue a completed assignment or reassignment certificate to the assignee or reassignee. A credit amount assigned under this subsection may be claimed against the assignees' tax under this act or under the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.1 to 206.532. An assignee or subsequent reassignee shall attach a copy of the completed assignment certificate to the annual return required to be filed under this act or under the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.1 to 206.532, for the tax year in which the assignment or reassignment is made and the assignee or reassignee first claims the credit, which shall be the same tax year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the credit allowed under this section for the tax year and any unused carryforward of the credit allowed by this section exceed the taxpayer's tax liability for the tax year, that portion that exceeds the tax liability for the tax year shall not be refunded but may be carried forward to offset tax liability in subsequent tax years for 10 years or until used up, whichever occurs first. If a qualified taxpayer has an unused carryforward of a credit under this section, the amount otherwise added under subsection (10), (11), or (12) to the qualified taxpayer's tax liability may instead be used to reduce the qualified taxpayer's carryforward under this section. An unused carryforward of a credit under section 39c of former 1975 PA 228 that was unused at the end of the last tax year for which former 1975 PA 228 was in effect may be claimed against the tax imposed under this act for the years the carryforward would have been available under section 39c of former 1975 PA 228. For projects for which a certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued for a tax year beginning after December 31, 2008 and for which the credit amount allowed is less than $250,000.00, a qualified taxpayer may elect to forgo the carryover period and receive a refund of the amount of the credit that exceeds the qualified taxpayer's tax liability. The amount of the refund shall be equal to 90% of the amount of the credit that exceeds the qualified taxpayer's tax liability. An election under this subsection shall be made in the year that a certificate of completed rehabilitation is issued and shall be irrevocable.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Except as otherwise provided under subsection (13), for tax years beginning after December 31, 2008, if a certificate of completed rehabilitation is revoked under subsection (5), a preapproval letter is revoked under subsection (23)(b), or an historic resource is sold or disposed of less than 5 years after the historic resource is placed in service as defined in section 47(b)(1) of the internal revenue code and related treasury regulations or if a certificate of completed rehabilitation issued after December 1, 2008 is revoked under subsection (5) during a tax year beginning after December 31, 2008, a preapproval letter issued after December 1, 2008 is revoked under subsection (23)(b) during a tax year beginning after December 31, 2008, or an historic resource is sold or disposed of less than 5 years after the historic resource is placed in service during a tax year beginning after December 31, 2008, the following percentage of the credit amount previously claimed relative to that historic resource shall be added back to the tax liability of the qualified taxpayer that received the certificate of completed rehabilitation and not the assignee in the year of the revocation:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Reasonable assurance that subsequent to the transfer the property will remain a historic resource during the 5-year period after the historic resource is placed in service.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) The qualified taxpayer shall attach all of the following to the qualified taxpayer's annual return required under this act or under the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.1 to 206.532, if applicable, on which the credit is claimed:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) In addition to the credit allowed under subsection (2) and subject to the criteria under this subsection and subsections (21), (22), and (23), for tax years that begin on and after January 1, 2009 a qualified taxpayer that has a preapproval letter issued on or before December 31, 2013 may claim an additional credit that has been approved under this subsection or subsection (20) against the tax imposed by this act equal to a percentage established in the taxpayer's preapproval letter of the qualified taxpayer's qualified expenditures for the rehabilitation of an historic resource or the actual amount of the qualified taxpayer's qualified expenditures incurred during the completion of the rehabilitation of an historic resource, whichever is less. The authority may approve 1 credit under this subsection for a qualified taxpayer that receives a certificate of completed rehabilitation for a credit under subsection (2) on or after January 1, 2009 and before November 15, 2009 notwithstanding that the qualified taxpayer has not received a preapproval letter for a credit under this subsection. The qualified taxpayer must apply for the additional credit under this subsection before January 1, 2010. If the additional credit approved under this subsection for a qualified taxpayer that has not received a preapproval letter on or before December 31, 2009 exceeds the allotted amount available for additional credits approved under this subsection in the calendar year ending December 31, 2009, then $2,800,000.00 of the allotted amount available in the calendar year ending December 31, 2010 may be allocated to that 1 credit. The total amount of all additional credits approved under this subsection shall not exceed $8,000,000.00 in calendar year ending December 31, 2009; $9,000,000.00 in calendar year ending December 31, 2010; $10,000,000.00 in calendar year ending December 31, 2011; $11,000,000.00 in calendar year ending December 31, 2012; and $12,000,000.00 in calendar year ending December 31, 2013 and, except as otherwise provided under this subsection, at least, 25% of the allotted amount for additional credits approved under this subsection during each calendar year shall be allocated to rehabilitation plans that have $1,000,000.00 or less in qualified expenditures. On October 1 of each calendar year, if the total of all credits approved under subdivision (a) for the calendar year is less than the minimum allotted amount, the authority may use the remainder of that allotted amount to approve applications for additional credits submitted under subdivision (b) for that calendar year. To be eligible for the additional credit under this subsection, the taxpayer shall apply to and receive a preapproval letter and comply with the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For a rehabilitation plan that has $1,000,000.00 or less in qualified expenditures, the taxpayer shall apply to the authority for approval of the additional credit under this subsection. Subject to the limitation provided under this subsection, the authority is authorized to approve an application under this subdivision and determine the percentage of at least 10% but not more than 15% of the taxpayer's qualified expenditures for which he or she may claim an additional credit. If the authority approves the application under this subdivision, then the authority shall issue a preapproval letter to the taxpayer that states that the taxpayer is a qualified taxpayer and the maximum percentage of the qualified expenditures on which a credit may be claimed for the rehabilitation plan when it is complete and a certification of completed rehabilitation is issued.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For a rehabilitation plan that has more than $1,000,000.00 in qualified expenditures, the taxpayer shall apply to the authority for approval of the additional credit under this subsection. The authority, subject to the approval of the president of the Michigan strategic fund or his or her designee, is authorized to approve an application under this subdivision and determine the percentage of up to 15% of the taxpayer's qualified expenditures for which he or she may claim an additional credit. An application shall be approved or denied not more than 15 business days after the authority has reviewed the application, determined the percentage amount of the credit for that applicant, and submitted the same to the president of the Michigan strategic fund or his or her designee. If the president of the Michigan strategic fund or his or her designee does not approve or deny the application within 15 business days after the application is received from the authority, the application is considered approved and the credit awarded in the amount as determined by the authority. If the president of the Michigan strategic fund or his or her designee approves the application under this subdivision, the director of the authority shall issue a preapproval letter to the taxpayer that states that the taxpayer is a qualified taxpayer and the maximum percentage of the qualified expenditures on which a credit may be claimed for the rehabilitation plan when it is complete and a certification of completed rehabilitation is issued.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, the authority, subject to the approval of the president of the Michigan strategic fund and the state treasurer, may approve 3 additional credits during the 2009 calendar year of up to 15% of the qualified taxpayer's qualified expenditures, and 2 additional credits during the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 calendar years of up to 15% of the qualified taxpayer's qualified expenditures, for certain rehabilitation plans that the authority determines is a high community impact rehabilitation plan that will have a significantly greater historic, social, and economic impact than those plans described under subsection (19)(a) and (b). The authority, subject to the approval of the president of the Michigan strategic fund and the state treasurer, may use 1 of the 2 additional credits available during the 2010 calendar year to approve an additional credit during the 2009 calendar year of up to 15% of the qualified taxpayer's qualified expenditures and 1 of the 2 additional credits available during the 2011 calendar year to approve an additional credit during the 2010 calendar year of up to 15% of the qualified taxpayer's qualified expenditures. Subject to the limitations provided under subsection (21), for the 2011, 2012, and 2013 calendar years, of the additional credits available under this subsection the authority may use 1 of those credits to approve a combined rehabilitation plan that the authority determines would allow for the rehabilitation of several multiple historic resources within the same geographic district and would have a greater impact on the community than the approval of a plan for the rehabilitation of a single larger historic resource. To be eligible for the additional credit under this subsection, the taxpayer shall apply to and receive a preapproval letter from the authority. The authority, subject to the approval of the president of the Michigan strategic fund and the state treasurer, may combine applications that are received for the rehabilitation of historic resources that are located within the same geographic district and that taken as a whole satisfy the additional requirements under subsection (28) and consider the approval of the combination of those applications as the approval of a single credit for a combined rehabilitation plan. An application shall be approved or denied not more than 15 business days after the authority has reviewed the application, determined the percentage amount of the credit for that applicant, and submitted the same to the president of the Michigan strategic fund and the state treasurer. If the president of the Michigan strategic fund and the state treasurer do not approve or deny the application within 15 business days after the application is received from the authority, the application is considered approved and the credit awarded in the amount as determined by the authority. If the president of the Michigan strategic fund and the state treasurer approve the application under this subsection, the authority shall issue a preapproval letter to the taxpayer that states that the taxpayer is a qualified taxpayer and the maximum percentage of the qualified expenditures on which a credit may be claimed for the high community impact rehabilitation plan when it is complete and a certification of completed rehabilitation is issued. Before approving a credit under this subsection, the authority shall consider all of the following criteria to the extent reasonably applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The importance of the historic resource to the community in which it is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the rehabilitation of the historic resource will act as a catalyst for additional rehabilitation or revitalization of the community in which it is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The potential that the rehabilitation of the historic resource will have for creating or preserving jobs and employment in the community in which it is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Other social benefits the rehabilitation of the historic resource will bring to the community in which it is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The amount of local community and financial support for the rehabilitation of the historic resource.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The taxpayer's financial need of the additional credit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Whether the taxpayer is eligible for the credit allowed under section 47(a)(2) of the internal revenue code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Any other criteria that the authority, the president of the Michigan strategic fund, and the state treasurer consider appropriate for the determination of approval under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) The maximum amount of credit that a taxpayer or an assignee may claim under subsection (20) during a tax year is $3,000,000.00. If the amount of the credit approved in the taxpayer's certificate of completed renovation is greater than $3,000,000.00 that portion that exceeds the cap shall be carried forward to offset tax liability in subsequent tax years until used up. The aggregate amount of credits approved under subsection (20) for a combined rehabilitation plan shall not exceed $24,000,000.00. Except as otherwise provided in the preapproval letter, the amount of the credit allowed for a combined rehabilitation plan shall be applied pro rata to each of the qualified taxpayers that submitted an application under subsection (20) that was considered a part of a combined rehabilitation plan. The taxpayer's pro rata share shall be the total amount of the credit allowed multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of investment made by the taxpayer for the rehabilitation of the taxpayer's historic resource during the tax year and the denominator of which is the sum of the investments made by all taxpayers for the rehabilitation of all historic resources included within the combined rehabilitation plan during the tax year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) Before approving a credit, determining the amount of such credit, and issuing a preapproval letter for such credit under subsection (19) or before considering an amendment to the preapproval letter, the authority shall consider the following criteria to the extent reasonably applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The importance of the historic resource to the community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The physical condition of the historic resource.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The taxpayer's financial need of the additional credit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The overall economic impact the renovation will have on the community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Any other criteria that the authority and the president of the Michigan strategic fund, as applicable, consider appropriate for the determination of approval under subsection (19).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(23) The authority may at any time before a certification of completed rehabilitation is issued for a credit for which a preapproval letter was issued pursuant to subsection (19) do the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Subject to the limitations and parameters under subsection (19), make amendments to the preapproval letter, which may include revising the amount of qualified expenditures for which the taxpayer may claim the additional credit under subsection (19). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Revoke the preapproval letter if the authority determines that there has not been substantial progress toward completion of the rehabilitation plan or that the rehabilitation plan cannot be completed. The authority shall provide the qualified taxpayer with a notice of his or her intent to revoke the preapproval letter 45 days prior to the proposed date of revocation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(24) If a preapproval letter is revoked under subsection (23)(b), the amount of the credit approved under that preapproval letter shall be added to the annual cap in the calendar year that the preapproval letter is revoked. After a certification of completed rehabilitation is issued for a rehabilitation plan approved under subsection (19), if the authority determines that the actual amount of the additional credit to be claimed by the taxpayer for the calendar year is less than the amount approved under the preapproval letter, the difference shall be added to the annual cap in the calendar year that the certification of completed rehabilitation is issued.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(25) Unless otherwise specifically provided under subsections (19) through (24), all other provisions under this section such as the recapture of credits, assignment of credits, and refundability of credits in excess of a qualified taxpayer's tax liability apply to the additional credits issued under subsections (19) and (20). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(26) In addition to meeting the criteria in subsection (20)(a) through (h), 3 of the credits available under subsection (20), including the credit used from the 2010 calendar year, and approved during the 2009 calendar year for a high community impact rehabilitation plan shall be for an application meeting 1 of the following criteria:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A qualified taxpayer may apply for projects under this section for eligible investment on more than 1 eligible property in a tax year. Each project approved and each project for which a certificate of completion is issued under this section shall be for eligible investment on 1 eligible property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If, after a taxpayer's project has been approved and the taxpayer has received a preapproval letter but before the taxpayer has made an eligible investment, other than soft costs or as otherwise authorized under subsection (34), at the property, the taxpayer determines that the project cannot be completed as preapproved, the taxpayer may petition the Michigan economic growth authority to amend the project and the preapproval letter to increase the maximum total eligible investment for the project on which credits may be claimed and the maximum total of all credits for the project. A taxpayer may petition the Michigan economic growth authority to make any other amendments to the project or preapproval letter at any time before a certificate of completion is issued. Except as otherwise authorized under subsection (34), amendments to the project or preapproval letter may include, but are not limited to, extending the duration of time provided to complete the project, as long as that extension does not exceed 10 years from the date of the preapproval letter or as otherwise extended under subsection (10). However, if a project was approved prior to December 31, 2008 for 20% of the qualified taxpayer's eligible investment and a total of less than $2,000,000.00 for all credits for that project and that project has received a funding reservation for an allocation of the federal low-income housing tax credit administered by the Michigan state housing development authority of more than $1,100,000.00, then that project may be amended to extend the duration of time provided to complete the project to the placed-in-service date of the carryover allocation agreement for the federal low-income housing tax credit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A project may be a multiphase project. If a project is a multiphase project, when each component of the multiphase project is completed, the taxpayer shall submit documentation that the component is complete, an accounting of the cost of the component, and the eligible investment for the component of each taxpayer eligible for a credit for the project of which the component is a part to the Michigan economic growth authority or the designee of the Michigan economic growth authority, who shall verify that the component is complete. When the completion of the component is verified, a component completion certificate shall be issued to the qualified taxpayer which shall state that the taxpayer is a qualified taxpayer, the credit amount for the component, the qualified taxpayer's federal employer identification number or the Michigan treasury number assigned to the taxpayer, and the project number. The taxpayer may assign all or part of the credit for a multiphase project as provided in this section after a component completion certificate for a component is issued. The qualified taxpayer may transfer ownership of or lease the completed component and assign a proportionate share of the credit for the entire project to the qualified taxpayer that is the new owner or lessee. A multiphase project shall not be divided into more than 10 components. A component is considered to be completed when a temporary or final certificate of occupancy has been issued by the local municipality in which the project is located for all of the buildings or facilities that comprise the completed component and a component completion certificate is issued or the chairperson of the Michigan economic growth authority or his or her designee, for projects approved under subsection (2) or (3), or the Michigan economic growth authority, for projects approved under subsection (4), verifies that the component is complete. A credit assigned based on a multiphase project shall be claimed by the assignee in the tax year in which the assignment is made. The total of all credits for a multiphase project shall not exceed the amount stated in the preapproval letter, as amended, for the project under subsection (1). Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, if all components of a multiphase project are not completed by 10 years after the date on which the preapproval letter, as amended, if applicable, for the project was issued, the qualified taxpayer that received the preapproval letter for the project shall pay to the state treasurer, as a penalty, an amount equal to the sum of all credits claimed and assigned for all components of the multiphase project and no credits based on that multiphase project shall be claimed after that date by the qualified taxpayer or any assignee of the qualified taxpayer. A qualified taxpayer that was approved for a credit based on a multiphase project by Resolution 2010-219 adopted by the Michigan economic growth authority and issued a preapproval letter on June 10, 2011 has until December 31, 2026 to complete that project and claim the credit without penalty if quarterly reports are submitted as required under this subsection and that project is completed and the temporary or final certificates of occupancy, as applicable, have been issued by the local municipality in which the project is located for all of the buildings or facilities that comprise the completed component by December 31, 2026. A qualified taxpayer that was approved for a credit based on a multiphase project by Resolution 2010-219 and was issued a certificate of completion before December 31, 2021 is not subject to repayment to this state under this subsection. A qualified taxpayer that was approved for a credit based on a multiphase project by Resolution 2010-219 adopted by the Michigan economic growth authority and issued a preapproval letter on June 10, 2011, but has not been issued a certificate of completion by September 14, 2023, must provide a quarterly report to the Michigan strategic fund on the progress of that project, including, but not limited to, the expected completion date, the names of any contractors or subcontractors engaged on the project, and the percentage of the project completed as of the immediately preceding quarter. The penalty under this subsection is subject to interest on the amount of the credit claimed or assigned determined individually for each component at the rate in section 23(2) of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.23, beginning on the date that the credit for that component was claimed or assigned. As used in this subsection, "proportionate share" means the same percentage of the total of all credits for the project that the qualified investment for the completed component is of the total qualified investment stated in the preapproval letter, as amended, for the entire project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) When a project under this section is completed, the taxpayer shall submit documentation that the project is completed, an accounting of the cost of the project, the eligible investment of each taxpayer if there is more than 1 taxpayer eligible for a credit for the project, and, if the taxpayer is not the owner or lessee of the eligible property on which the eligible investment was made at the time the project is completed, that the taxpayer was the owner or lessee of, or was a party to an agreement to purchase or lease, that eligible property when all eligible investment of the taxpayer was made. The chairperson of the Michigan economic growth authority or his or her designee, for projects approved under subsection (2) or (3), or the Michigan economic growth authority, for projects approved under subsection (4), shall verify that the project is completed. The Michigan economic growth authority shall conduct an on-site inspection as part of the verification process for projects approved under subsection (4). When the completion of the project is verified, a certificate of completion shall be issued to each qualified taxpayer that has made eligible investment on that eligible property.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) For a multiphase project under subsection (10), the amount of each credit assigned and the amount of all credits claimed in each tax year before the year in which the project is completed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Except as otherwise provided in this section, qualified taxpayers shall claim credits under this section in the tax year in which the certificate of completion is issued. For a project approved under subsection (4) for which the total of all credits is more than $10,000,000.00 but $30,000,000.00 or less, the qualified taxpayer shall claim 10% of its approved credit each year for 10 years. A credit assigned based on a multiphase project shall be claimed in the year in which the credit is assigned.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The cost of eligible investment for leased machinery, equipment, or fixtures is the cost of that property had the property been purchased minus the lessor's estimate, made at the time the lease is entered into, of the market value the property will have at the end of the lease. A credit for property described in this subsection is allowed only if the cost of that property had the property been purchased and the lessor's estimate of the market value at the end of the lease are provided to the Michigan economic growth authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) Credits claimed by a lessee of eligible property are subject to the total of all credits limitation under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) Each qualified taxpayer and assignee under subsection (20), (21), or (22) that claims a credit under this section shall attach a copy of the certificate of completion and, if the credit was assigned, a copy of the assignment form provided for under this section to the annual return filed under this act on which the credit under this section is claimed. An assignee of a credit based on a multiphase project shall attach a copy of the assignment form provided for under this section and the component completion certificate provided for in subsection (10) to the annual return filed under this act on which the credit is claimed but is not required to file a copy of a certificate of completion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection or subsection (10), (18), (20), (21), or (22), a credit under this section shall be claimed in the tax year in which the certificate of completion is issued to the qualified taxpayer. For a project described in subsection (11)(f) for which a schedule for claiming annual credit amounts is designated on the certificate of completion by the Michigan economic growth authority, the annual credit amount shall be claimed in the tax year specified on the certificate of completion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, the credits approved under this section shall be calculated after application of all other credits allowed under this act. The credits under this section shall be calculated before the calculation of the credits under sections 413, 423, 431, and 450.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, if the credit allowed under this section for the tax year and any unused carryforward of the credit allowed under this section exceed the qualified taxpayer's or assignee's tax liability for the tax year, that portion that exceeds the tax liability for the tax year shall not be refunded but may be carried forward to offset tax liability in subsequent tax years for 10 years or until used up, whichever occurs first. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the maximum time allowed under the carryforward provisions under this subsection begins with the tax year in which the certificate of completion is issued to the qualified taxpayer. If the qualified taxpayer assigns all or any portion of its credit approved under this section, the maximum time allowed under the carryforward provisions for an assignee begins to run with the tax year in which the assignment is made and the assignee first claims a credit, which shall be the same tax year. The maximum time allowed under the carryforward provisions for an annual credit amount for a credit allowed under subsection (4) begins to run in the tax year for which the annual credit amount is designated on the certificate of completion issued under this section. A credit carryforward available under section 38g of former 1975 PA 228 that is unused at the end of the last tax year may be claimed against the tax imposed under this act for the years the carryforward would have been available under former 1975 PA 228. Beginning on and after April 8, 2008, if the credit allowed under this section for the tax year exceeds the qualified taxpayer's tax liability for the tax year, the qualified taxpayer may elect to have the excess refunded at a rate equal to 85% of that portion of the credit that exceeds the tax liability of the qualified taxpayer for the tax year and forgo the remaining 15% of the credit and any carryforward.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) If a project or credit under this section is for the addition of personal property, if the cost of that personal property is used to calculate a credit under this section, and if the personal property is disposed of or transferred from the eligible property to any other location, the qualified taxpayer that disposed of that property, or transferred the personal property shall add the same percentage as determined under subsection (1) of the federal basis of the personal property used for determining gain or loss as of the date of the disposition or transfer to the qualified taxpayer's tax liability under this act after application of all credits under this act for the tax year in which the disposition or transfer occurs. If a qualified taxpayer has an unused carryforward of a credit under this section, the amount otherwise added under this subsection to the qualified taxpayer's tax liability may instead be used to reduce the qualified taxpayer's carryforward under subsection (18).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) For credits under this section for projects for which a certificate of completion is issued before January 1, 2006 and except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if a qualified taxpayer pays or accrues eligible investment on or to an eligible property that is leased for a minimum term of 10 years or sold to another taxpayer for use in a business activity, the qualified taxpayer may assign all or a portion of the credit under this section based on that eligible investment to the lessee or purchaser of that eligible property. A credit assignment under this subsection shall only be made to a taxpayer that when the assignment is complete will be a qualified taxpayer. All credit assignments under this subsection are irrevocable and, except for a credit based on a multiphase project, shall be made in the tax year in which the certificate of completion is issued, unless the assignee is an unknown lessee. If a qualified taxpayer wishes to assign all or a portion of its credit to a lessee but the lessee is unknown in the tax year in which the certificate of completion is issued, the qualified taxpayer may delay claiming and assigning the credit until the first tax year in which the lessee is known. A qualified taxpayer may claim a portion of a credit and assign the remaining credit amount. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if the qualified taxpayer both claims and assigns portions of the credit, the qualified taxpayer shall claim the portion it claims in the tax year in which the certificate of completion is issued or, for a credit assigned and claimed for a multiphase project before a certificate of completion is issued, the taxpayer shall claim the credit in the year in which the credit is assigned. If a qualified taxpayer assigns all or a portion of the credit and the eligible property is leased to more than 1 taxpayer, the qualified taxpayer shall determine the amount of credit assigned to each lessee. A lessee shall not subsequently assign a credit or any portion of a credit assigned under this subsection. A purchaser may subsequently assign a credit or any portion of a credit assigned to the purchaser under this subsection to a lessee of the eligible property. The credit assignment under this subsection shall be made on a form prescribed by the Michigan economic growth authority. The qualified taxpayer shall send a copy of the completed assignment form to the Michigan economic growth authority in the tax year in which the assignment is made. The assignee shall attach a copy of the completed assignment form to its annual return required to be filed under this act, for the tax year in which the assignment is made and the assignee first claims a credit, which shall be the same tax year. In addition to all other procedures under this subsection, the following apply if the total of all credits for a project is more than $10,000,000.00 but $30,000,000.00 or less:</div>

A credit assignment under this subsection is irrevocable and, except for a credit assignment based on a multiphase project, shall be made in the tax year in which a certificate of completion is issued. A qualified taxpayer may claim a portion of a credit and assign the remaining credit amount. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if the qualified taxpayer both claims and assigns portions of the credit, the qualified taxpayer shall claim the portion it claims in the tax year in which a certificate of completion is issued or for a credit assigned and claimed for a multiphase project, before the component completion certificate is issued, the taxpayer shall claim the credit in the year in which the credit is assigned.

If a qualified taxpayer wishes to assign all or a portion of its credit to a lessee but the lessee is unknown in the tax year in which the certificate of completion is issued, the qualified taxpayer may delay claiming and assigning the credit until the first tax year in which the lessee is known. A qualified taxpayer may claim a portion of a credit and assign the remaining credit amount.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) To claim a credit under this section, a taxpayer shall submit an investment expenditure certificate issued under subsection (5) to the department. If the credit allowed under this section exceeds the amount of taxes owed by the taxpayer under this act for a tax year, that portion of the credit that exceeds the tax liability of the taxpayer for the tax year shall not be refunded but may be carried forward to offset tax liability under this act in subsequent tax years for a period not to exceed 10 tax years or until used up, whichever occurs first.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The credit under this section shall be claimed after all other credits under this act.

Except as otherwise provided under subsection (7), if a person awarded a certificated credit is a member of a unitary business group, the unitary business group, and not the member, shall file a return and pay the tax, if any, under this act and claim the certificated credit. Except as otherwise provided under subsection (7), if the taxpayer that elects to file a return and pay the tax imposed by this act in order to claim a certificated credit or any unused carryforward of that credit for that tax year is a unitary business group, the return filed by the unitary business group shall include all persons included in the unitary business group regardless of whether that person is incorporated. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act or part 2 or 3 of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.601 to 206.713, in the case of a flow-through entity that has made an election under this section, each member of the flow-through entity that does not file as a member of a unitary business group with the flow-through entity shall disregard all items attributable to that member's ownership interest in the electing flow-through entity for all purposes of part 2 of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.601 to 206.699, and the electing flow-through entity shall not be subject to the tax withholding provisions of section 703(4) of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.703, with respect to its members that are corporations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A taxpayer with a certificated credit under section 435 or 437, which certificated credit or any unused carryforward may be claimed in a tax year ending after December 31, 2011 may elect to pay the tax imposed by this act in the tax year in which that certificated credit may be claimed in lieu of the tax imposed under part 2 of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.601 to 206.699. If a person with a certificated credit under section 435 or 437 that elects under this subsection to pay the tax imposed by this act is a member of a unitary business group, the unitary business group, and not the member, shall file a return and pay the tax, if any, under this act and claim that certificated credit. 
</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A taxpayer with a certificated credit under section 435 or 437 that elects under subsection (2) after the taxpayer's first tax year ending after December 31, 2011 to pay the tax imposed by this act may claim any other certificated credit that taxpayer would be eligible for in the year in which the taxpayer claims a certificated credit under section 435 or 437, but not any certificated credit that would have accrued in any year before the election under subsection (2). A taxpayer with a certificated credit under section 437(10) that elects under subsection (2) after the taxpayer's first tax year after December 31, 2011 to pay the tax imposed by this act shall continue to file a return and pay the tax imposed under this act for each tax year thereafter until the certificated credit under section 437(10) is complete and that credit is used up. When the taxpayer's certificated credit under section 435 or 437 that was the basis for the taxpayer's election under subsection (2) is extinguished, the taxpayer is no longer eligible to pay the tax under this act and may no longer claim any other remaining certificated credits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) For tax years that begin after December 31, 2011, a taxpayer's tax liability under this act, after application of all credits, deductions, and exemptions, shall be the greater of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The amount of the taxpayer's tax liability under this act, notwithstanding the calculation required under this section, after application of all credits, deductions, and exemptions and any carryforward of any unused credit as prescribed in this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An amount equal to the taxpayer's tax liability as computed pursuant to part 2 of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.601 to 206.699, after application of all credits, deductions, and exemptions under part 2 of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.601 to 206.699, as if the taxpayer were subject to the tax imposed under part 2 of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.601 to 206.699, less the amount of the taxpayer's certificated credits, including any unused carryforward of a certificated credit, that the taxpayer was allowed to claim for the tax year under this act. However, in calculating the amount under this subdivision, the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A taxpayer described under section 117(5)(a) shall not include a deduction for any business loss under section 623(4) of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.623, for any prior year in which the taxpayer was not subject to the tax levied under this act.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) For a taxpayer that is a partnership or subchapter S corporation, business income includes payments and items of income and expense that are attributable to business activity of the partnership or S corporation and separately reported to the members. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the result of the calculation under subsection (4) is negative, the taxpayer shall be refunded that amount.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A taxpayer with a certificated credit under subsection (7) or section 435 or 437 that elects to pay the tax under this act may elect to claim a refundable credit as provided under section 510. If a refundable credit is claimed under section 510, that credit shall not be used to calculate a taxpayer's tax liability under subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Subject to the limitations provided under this subsection, a taxpayer that is a member of a unitary business group and that has a certificated credit under sections 431 and 434(2) and (5) is not required to file a combined return as a unitary business group and may elect to file a separate return and pay the tax, if any, under this act and claim the certificated credit under section 434(5) as provided under this subsection. A taxpayer that elects to file a separate return as provided under this subsection and redeem a voucher certificate under a voucher agreement entered pursuant to this subsection and proceeding from an agreement entered pursuant to section 434(5) for an amount equal to the employment expenses and related engineering product development and administrative costs for the support of integrated battery cells, anodes and cathodes, and cell assembly shall create an additional 100 new jobs in this state, for a total of 400 new jobs, and the maximum allowable amount redeemed under this subsection or under section 510 shall not exceed $25,000,000.00 per year for no more than 3 years. A taxpayer that elects to file as provided under this subsection and redeem a voucher certificate under a voucher agreement entered pursuant to this subsection and proceeding from an agreement entered pursuant to section 434(5) shall not claim a credit for any agreement entered pursuant to section 431 or 434(2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A taxpayer with a certificated credit granted under section 36109 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.36109, which certificated credit had been claimed in a previous tax year under part 1 of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.1 to 206.532, but that certificated credit is no longer eligible to be claimed under part 1 of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.1 to 206.532, as a result of the death occurring after December 31, 2011 of an individual farmland owner, or an individual considered the farmland owner under section 36109(1)(d) of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.36109, and the transfer of the ownership of the farmland property subject to the farmland development rights agreement upon which that certificated credit is based into an estate or trust, may elect to pay the tax imposed by this act in the first tax year in which that certificated credit may be claimed under this act. A taxpayer that elects under this subsection to pay the tax imposed by this act shall continue to file a return and pay the tax imposed under this act for each tax year thereafter until the certificated credit granted under section 36109 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.36109, is complete and that credit is used up, or the taxpayer no longer owns the property subject to the agreement, whichever occurs first. When the taxpayer's certificated credit under section 36109 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.36109, that was the basis for the taxpayer's election under this subsection is extinguished, or the taxpayer no longer owns that property under the agreement, whichever occurs first, the taxpayer is no longer eligible to pay the tax under this act and may no longer claim any other remaining certificated credits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A taxpayer described under section 117(5)(c) may, for the first tax year ending after October 1, 2018 only, elect to file the return and pay the tax imposed by this act in lieu of the tax imposed under part 2 of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.601 to 206.699. However, if the first tax year ending after October 1, 2018 ends before the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection and the taxpayer has already filed a return for that tax year under part 2 of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.601 to 206.699, then the taxpayer may, if within the statute of limitations period prescribed under section 27a of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.27a, elect to file the return and pay the tax imposed by this act in lieu of the tax imposed under part 2 of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.601 to 206.699, for that tax year by filing an original return as provided under section 505 and filing the necessary amended return under part 2 of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.601 to 206.699. The department may require documentation from the taxpayer that elects to file a return under this subsection to support the acquisition of the certificated credit that is the basis for the election. The terms, conditions, and amount of the certificated credit that is the basis for the election shall continue and shall not be expanded in any manner that would increase the total amount of that certificated credit as a result of an election made under this subsection. A taxpayer that elects pursuant to this subsection to pay the tax imposed by this act may claim any other certificated credit that the person from whom the certificated credit that was the basis for the election was transferred would have been eligible to claim in the same tax year in which the taxpayer claims the certificated credit under section 431 that was the basis for the election, but shall not claim any certificated credit that the acquiring taxpayer would have accrued in any tax year before the election under this subsection or any other certificated credit for which an election could have been made by the acquiring taxpayer under subsection (1) for the acquiring taxpayer's first tax year ending after December 31, 2011. When the taxpayer's certificated credit under section 431 that was the basis for the taxpayer's election under this subsection is extinguished, the taxpayer is no longer eligible to pay the tax under this act and may no longer claim any other remaining certificated credits.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A taxpayer that reasonably expects liability for the tax year to exceed $800.00 shall file an estimated return and pay an estimated tax for each quarter of the taxpayer's tax year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) For taxpayers on a calendar year basis, the quarterly returns and estimated payments shall be made by April 15, July 15, October 15, and January 15.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, the estimated payment made with each quarterly return of each tax year shall be for the estimated business income tax base and modified gross receipts tax base for the quarter or 25% of the estimated annual liability. The second, third, and fourth estimated payments in each tax year shall include adjustments, if necessary, to correct underpayments or overpayments from previous quarterly payments in the tax year to a revised estimate of the annual tax liability. For a taxpayer that calculates and pays estimated payments for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 6655(e) of the internal revenue code, that taxpayer may use the same methodology as used to calculate the annualized income installment or the adjusted seasonal installment, whichever is used as the basis for the federal estimated payment, to calculate the estimated payments required each quarter under this section. A penalty for underpayment of an estimated tax under this act shall not be assessed for a tax year that ends before December 1, 2009 if the taxpayer paid 75% of the tax due under this act for the tax year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The interest provided by this act shall not be assessed if any of the following occur:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the sum of the estimated payments equals at least 85% of the liability and the amount of each estimated payment reasonably approximates the tax liability incurred during the quarter for which the estimated payment was made.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Each estimated return shall be made on a form prescribed by the department and shall include an estimate of the annual tax liability and other information required by the state treasurer. The form prescribed under this subsection may be combined with any other tax reporting form prescribed by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) With respect to a taxpayer filing an estimated tax return for the taxpayer's first tax year of less than 12 months, the amounts paid with each return shall be proportional to the number of payments made in the first tax year.</div>
