<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Revenue bonds. The commission is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of revenue bonds of the state (A) for the purpose of paying the cost as hereinabove defined of any 1 or more public works which said commission is authorized by this act to acquire or construct, which resolution shall recite an estimate of such cost, or (B) to refund any revenue bonds, heretofore or hereafter issued under the provisions of this act, not earlier than 1 year prior to either the date of maturity of such revenue bonds or the date upon which they may be redeemed prior to maturity, or at any time, upon the surrender for payment of at least an equal par amount of revenue bonds authorized by said resolution to be refunded: Provided, That any issue of such refunding bonds shall not exceed the total par amount of outstanding revenue bonds, less any available funds and sinking fund balances. Such refunding bonds shall be sold to the highest bidder upon sealed bids, the same to be publicly opened by the commission. No bid shall be accepted by the commission except upon the express approval of the state treasurer. Highest bidder is hereby defined as the person, firm or corporation submitting a proposal which shall effect the greatest saving of interest upon the bonds refunded. Notice of such sale shall be published at least 7 days prior to the day of opening bids in the Michigan Investor, the Bond Buyer and such other financial journals as the commission may deem advisable. No sale of such refunding bonds shall be made at a figure of less than that required to redeem and pay the bonds refunded and effect a net saving of at least /2 of 1% upon the bonds refunded. The principal and interest of such bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund herein provided for such payment. Such revenue bonds shall bear interest at not more than 6 per centum per annum, payable semi-annually, and shall mature at such time or times not more than 40 years from their date or dates as may be fixed by such resolution. All such revenue bonds may be made redeemable before maturity at the option of the commission at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the commission prior to the issuance of the bonds. The principal and interest of such revenue bonds may be made payable in any lawful medium. The commission shall determine the form of the bonds and the interest coupons to be attached thereto and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. Revenue bonds issued by the commission shall be signed by the governor and by the chairman of the commission, under the great seal of the state, attested by the secretary of state, and the coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signature of said chairman of the commission. Any refunding bonds issued shall be signed solely by the chairman and the secretary of the commission, under the seal of the commission. All bonds issued under this act shall contain a statement on their face that the state shall not be obligated to pay the same or the interest thereon except from the revenues of the works. In case any of the officers whose signatures appear on the bonds and coupons shall cease to be such officers before the delivery of such bonds, such signatures shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if they had remained in office until such delivery. All such revenue bonds shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the state. Such bonds shall be exempt from all taxation, state, county and municipal, and unless otherwise provided by law, shall be lawful investments in the same manner and to the same extent as other bonds of the state. Provision may be made for the registration of any of the bonds in the name of the owner as to principal alone or as to both principal and interest. The commission may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interests of the state, taking into consideration the financial responsibility of the purchaser and the terms and conditions of the purchase, and especially the availability of the proceeds of the bonds when required for payment of the cost of the works, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of more than 6 per cent interest on the money received therefor, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values. The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the works, or, in the case of refunding bonds, for the payment of the revenue bonds refunded, and shall be checked out in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the commission may provide. If the proceeds of the revenue bonds, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the works, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit and, unless otherwise provided in the trust indenture hereinafter mentioned, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund, without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same works. If the proceeds of bonds issued for any such works shall exceed the cost thereof, the surplus shall be paid into the fund hereinafter provided for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the commission may under like restrictions issue temporary bonds with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified and required by this act or by the constitution of the state. In the discretion of the commission revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of paying the cost of any 1 or more public works, whether of the same class or 2 or more classes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A report shall be made by the commission to the state administrative board on or before the fifteenth day of January, fifteenth day of April, fifteenth day of July, fifteenth day of October of each year, which report shall state the receipts and disbursements during the preceding quarter, and shall contain such further information as the state administrative board shall require.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Trust indenture. In the discretion of the commission, any series or issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the commission and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state, but no such trust indenture shall convey or mortgage the works or any part thereof. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper, not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the state and the commission in relation to the acquisition, construction, improvement, maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the works, the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and may provide that the works shall be acquired, constructed, or partly acquired and partly constructed, and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers employed or designated by the commission and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, who may be given the right to require that security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues of the works or other moneys pertaining thereto, be satisfactory to such purchasers, their successors, assigns or nominees. Such resolution or indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and trustee, restricting the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. Except as in this act otherwise provided, the commission may provide by resolution or by such trust indenture for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the revenues of the works to such officer, board or depositary as it may determine for the custody thereof, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. Any bank or trust company designated as a depositary, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, is hereby authorized, with the approval of the commissioner of the state banking department, to pledge as collateral security for moneys deposited by the trustee in such depositary, direct obligations of, or obligations the principal and interest of which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States government, or other marketable securities eligible as security for the deposit of trust funds under regulations of the federal reserve board and having a market value (exclusive of accrued interest) at least equal to the amount of such deposit, or in lieu of such collateral security as to all or any part of such deposit, there shall have been lodged with the trustee, or with the secretary of the commission in the case of moneys deposited or remaining on deposit with the trustee, and remain in full force and effect as security for the moneys deposited, the indemnifying bond or bonds of a surety company or companies qualified as surety for United States government deposits and qualified to transact business in the state of Michigan in a sum at least equal to the amount of moneys deposited with such bank or trust company or such part thereof, such bond or bonds to be approved in writing by the commission: Provided, however, That it shall not be necessary for the trustee to give collateral security or file a surety bond as security for the deposit of that amount of the proceeds of the bonds which shall be paid out of the construction fund simultaneously with the delivery of the bonds: And provided further, however, That the cost of any surety bond furnished by the trustee may be paid for out of funds from time to time in the hands of the trustee. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repairs of the works affected by such indenture.</DIV>

Such tolls, fees, rents, rates or other charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any state bureau, board, commission or agency. At or before the issuance of any revenue bonds, the commission shall by resolution create a sinking fund for the payment of the bonds and the interest thereon, and the payment of the charges of banks or trust companies for making payment of such bonds or interest, and shall set aside and pledge a sufficient amount of the net revenues of the works, hereby defined to be the revenues of the works remaining after the payment of the reasonable expense of operation, maintenance and repairs, such amount to be paid into such sinking fund at intervals to be determined by the commission prior to the issuance of the bonds, for (a) the interest upon such bonds as such interest shall fall due and (b) the necessary fiscal agency charges for paying bonds and interest and (c) the payment of the bonds as they fall due, or, if all bonds mature at 1 time, the proper maintenance of a sinking fund sufficient for the payment thereof at such time, and (d) a margin for the payment of premiums upon bonds retired by call or purchase as herein provided. Such required payments shall constitute a first charge upon all the net revenues of the works. Prior to the issuance of revenue bonds, the commission may provide by resolution or by such trust indenture for using the sinking fund or any part thereof in the purchase of any of the outstanding bonds payable therefrom at the market price thereof, but not exceeding the price, if any, at which the same shall at the next interest date be payable or redeemable, and all bonds redeemed or purchased shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued. The moneys in the sinking fund, less a reserve for payment of not exceeding 1 year's interest on the bonds, if not used within a reasonable time for the purchase of bonds for cancellation as above provided, shall be applied to the redemption of bonds by lot at the redemption price then applicable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The commission is authorized and empowered to enter into any contract or contracts with the state highway department of the state of Michigan and the department of highways of the province of Ontario, for the maintenance of said bridge and its approaches.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 5.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The authority is hereby authorized to provide for the issuance, at one time or from time to time, of revenue bonds of the authority for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of the project. The principal of and the interest on such bonds shall be payable solely from the funds herein provided for such payment. The bonds shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates not exceeding 6% per annum, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their date, as may be determined by the authority, and shall be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of the principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. The bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the authority or shall bear his facsimile signature, and the official seal of the authority or a facsimile thereof shall be impressed or imprinted thereon and attested by the secretary-treasurer of the authority, and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. The authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this act, subject to the approval of the state administrative board of the state of Michigan.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The proceeds of the bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project, and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing the same. If the proceeds of the bonds, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for such bonds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost. Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this act without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau or agency of the state, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by this act.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In the discretion of the authority the bonds issued under the provisions of this act may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the tolls and other revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage the project or any part thereof. Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation and insurance of the project, the rates of toll to be charged, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Any such trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders.

The tolls shall be fixed and adjusted so as to provide a fund sufficient with other revenues, if any, to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing, and operating the project and the principal of and the interest on the bonds as they become due and payable, and to create reserves for these purposes. Revenue collected from the use or disposition of the project is appropriated exclusively for those purposes. The tolls shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any other commission, board, bureau, or agency of the state. The tolls and all other revenues derived from the project, except that part necessary to pay the cost of maintenance, repair, and operation and to provide reserves as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust agreement in a sinking fund that is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on those bonds as they become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as provided in the resolution or trust agreement. The pledge is valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. The tolls and other revenues or other money so pledged and thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery or further act, and the lien of the pledge is valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority, irrespective of whether the parties have notice of the lien. The resolution or trust agreement by which a pledge is created need not be filed or recorded except in the records of the authority. The use and disposition of money to the credit of the sinking fund are subject to the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust agreement. Except as may otherwise be provided in the resolution or trust agreement, the sinking fund is a fund for all the bonds without distinction or priority of one over another.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 4.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The authority is hereby authorized and empowered to construct a suitable bridge (as “construct” and “bridge” are above defined) joining and linking together the upper peninsula and the lower peninsula of Michigan and to operate, maintain, improve and repair such bridge. The cost of such construction of the bridge shall be paid from the proceeds of bonds issued hereunder and from any other funds legally available for the payment of such cost: Provided, That nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to permit the authority to incur obligations which would constitute an indebtedness of the state within the meaning of any constitutional prohibition or limitation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In connection with the construction of the bridge the authority is hereby empowered to purchase or otherwise acquire all property and rights necessary thereto, including but not limited to roads, structures, rights-of-way, franchises, easements and other interests in lands, including lands under water, and the riparian rights of any person, natural or corporate, political entity or political subdivision, and including the right to cut off light, air and access to real property, upon such terms and at such prices as may be fair and reasonable. Whenever it shall become necessary, any such property may be condemned and the authority is hereby empowered in its discretion to condemn any property or interest therein which it may deem necessary for such purpose. In the condemnation of property or interest therein, the authority may proceed under any act applicable thereto, or it may invoke and proceed under the provisions of Act No. 149 of the Public Acts of 1911, as now or hereafter amended, and in so doing shall have all the rights, powers and privileges granted to “public corporations” as defined in that act. The authority may enter on any lands, waters and premises for the purpose of making surveys, soundings and examinations. The state of Michigan hereby expressly grants to the authority, without consideration, the right to use, and full easements and rights-of-way through, across, under and over any lands or property owned by the state or in which the state has any right, title or interest, which may be necessary or convenient to the construction and efficient operation of the bridge.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The authority may by resolution of the board provide for the issuance of revenue bonds for the purpose of paying the cost of the bridge or for the purpose of refunding the bonds, including refunding bonds, or for any combination of these purposes. Refunding bonds may be either sold at not less than par and accrued interest or may be delivered in exchange for the bonds to be refunded or may be sold in part and exchanged in part and if sold, the proceeds of the sale or exchange when received, together with other properly available funds sufficient to pay the balance of the principal, interest, and redemption premiums that will be due on the bonds to be refunded, shall be deposited with the paying agent for the bonds to be refunded and used only for the purpose of making those payments. A sale or exchange described in this subsection is subject to the approval of the state administrative board. The board may enter into contracts for fiscal agents' services in connection with the financing of the bridge as approved by the state administrative board, or the state treasurer may be used as fiscal agent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Principal of and interest and redemption premiums on the bonds issued under this section are payable solely from the revenues of the authority, except that payments may also be made from the proceeds of refunding bonds issued under this section and capitalized interest may be paid from the proceeds of the bonds. The bonds may be either serial bonds, term bonds, or a combination of serial and term bonds. Any serial bonds shall have annual or semiannual maturities, the first maturity of which shall be payable not more than 10 years from their date. A term bond is redeemable on any interest payment date at a price and upon terms and conditions as prescribed by the authorizing resolution of the board, and recited upon the face of the bond. A bond shall mature not more than 50 years from its date, shall be a coupon bond bearing interest at not more than 6% per annum, payable semiannually except as to the first coupon which may be for any number of months not exceeding 10, shall be payable in a medium, shall be in a form and executed in a manner, shall have a privilege of registration as to principal or principal and interest, shall be payable at a place inside or outside this state, and shall otherwise have other details as fixed by resolution of the board. Serial bonds may be made redeemable prior to maturity at a price and under terms and conditions prescribed in the resolution of the board, and recited upon the face of the bonds.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A bond issued under this section shall contain a statement on its face that neither the bond nor the coupon representing interest on the bond constitutes an indebtedness of this state within the meaning of any constitutional limitations or prohibitions and that neither the authority nor this state is authorized to pay the bond or interest except from the revenues pledged to the bond or interest under this act. In case any official whose signature appears on a bond or coupon ceases to be an officer before the delivery of the bond, his or her signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as though he or she had remained in office until delivery. A bond issued under this section is fully negotiable and has all of the qualities incident to negotiable instruments under the uniform commercial code, subject only to the provisions for registration of the bond that appears in the bond. A bond issued under this section is exempt from all taxation by this state or a political subdivision of this state and shall be sold at public sale after notice at least 5 days before the sale in a publication approved by the department of treasury for the carrying of the notice, but no sale shall be made at a price that will result in an interest cost of more than 6% per annum. However, all or any part of a bond issued under this section may be sold to the United States government or an agency of the United States government, at private sale without public offering and the authority is authorized to enter into any agreements or contracts with the United States government or any of its agencies necessary to provide for the financing of the bridge in the manner contemplated by this act. A bond issued under this section may be authorized and may be issued from time to time as needed and subsequent series or issues of a bond issued under this section have equal or subordinate status with respect to the pledge of revenues from which the bond is payable as provided in the proceedings authorizing its issuance. Any public sale, or negotiated sale of a bond issued under this section with the United States government or any of its agencies, is subject to the approval of the state administrative board. Prior to the preparation of a definitive bond, the board may provide for the issuance of a temporary bond with or without a coupon, exchangeable for a definitive bond upon the issuance of the temporary bond. The proceedings authorizing a bond issued under this section may provide that the bond shall contain a recital that it is issued under this act and the recital is conclusive evidence of its validity and the regularity of its issuance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) This section does not apply to the acquisition, construction, operation, maintenance, improvement, repair, or management of a utility tunnel. As used in this subsection, "utility tunnel" means that term as defined in section 14.</div>

Either the resolution providing for the issuance of bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for the security and payment of such bonds and for the protection and enforcement of the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be deemed advisable by the board, not in violation of the constitution of this state, including specifically covenants setting forth: (a) The duties of the authority in relationship to the construction, maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the bridge; (b) the pledge of the revenues of the bridge or any part thereof; (c) limitations on the amount of money derived from the operation of the bridge which may be expended for operating, administrative or other specified expenses of the authority; (d) the safeguarding and application of the fund from which the cost of the bridge is to be paid and of the revenues pledged to the payment of the bonds, all of which may be deposited in as received and paid out by such bank or banks as may be therein provided, and none of which need be paid into the state treasury; (e) provision for the employment of consulting engineers to supervise the construction of the bridge and to supervise its maintenance and operation, to which consulting engineers may be delegated all rights and duties with respect thereto deemed advisable by the board and the appointment of which consulting engineers shall be subject to such approval by the purchasers or holders of the bonds as may be provided in such resolution or indenture; (f) rights and remedies of the bondholders and the trustee, if any, and such restrictions thereon as may be considered advisable; and (g) any other and additional provisions ordinarily found in trust agreements securing bond issues protecting and enforcing the rights and security of the holders of the bonds and designed to make the bonds more attractive and negotiable at the best available prices. The resolution or trust indenture shall contain a provision requiring an annual audit of the books and records of the authority, or any fiscal agent or trustees specified in such resolution or trust indenture, by the auditor general of the state of Michigan: Provided, That the auditor general may select a certified public accountant or accountants to make the audit, and in case the auditor general shall so select, the cost thereof shall be paid by the authority. No deposit shall be made under the provisions of this act in violation of the provisions of section 15 of article 10 of the Michigan constitution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Any bank or trust company designated as trustee hereunder or designated as depository for any funds hereunder, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, is hereby authorized to pledge as collateral security for moneys deposited in such bank or trust company direct obligations of or obligations the principal and interest of which are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States government or other marketable securities eligible as security for the deposit of trust funds under regulations of the federal reserve board and having a market value (exclusive of accrued interest) at least equal to the amount of such deposit, or in lieu of such collateral security as to all or any part of such deposit, there may be lodged with the trustee, or with the secretary of the authority in the case of moneys deposited or remaining on deposit with the trustee, and remain in full force and effect as security for the moneys deposited in the indemnifying bond or bonds of a surety company or companies qualified as surety for United States government deposits and qualified to transact business in the state of Michigan, in a sum at least equal to the amount of moneys deposited with such bank or trust company, if such indemnity bond or bonds be approved by the state administrative board. All expenses incurred in carrying out such provisions appearing in any trust indenture or bond resolution and the cost of any surety bond furnished as above provided may be treated as part of the cost of maintaining and operating the bridge.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Such resolution or trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the board may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders, including, but without limitation, covenants prescribing all happenings or occurrences which constitute events of default and the terms and conditions upon which bonds may become or be declared to be due before maturity and as to the rights, liabilities, powers and duties arising upon the breach by the authority of any of its duties or obligations. Any such resolution or trust indenture shall be subject to the approval of the state administrative board.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The authority shall properly construct, maintain, operate, repair, manage and control the bridge, except as hereinafter provided, and shall determine the rates of tolls and charges to be made for the services and facilities afforded thereby and may make and enter into all contracts or agreements deemed necessary or desirable to the performance of its duties and the execution of its powers under this act including, but not limited to, power to permit use of the bridge by public carriers and for telephone, telegraph and other utility lines and to contract for such use and determine the terms and conditions thereof, and the rates to be charged therefor. The authority may in its discretion construct as a part of the bridge telephone, telegraph or other utility lines and mechanical equipment not inconsistent with the appropriate use of the bridge and may lease the right to use the same on such terms and for such considerations as it shall determine. Tolls, fees, rents and charges shall be fixed, imposed and collected for the use of the bridge and its services and facilities so as to make the revenues to be derived from the operation of the bridge fully sufficient, until such time as the principal of and interest on the bonds herein authorized are paid in full (a) pay all expenses of operating, repairing and maintaining the bridge, except to the extent that such expenses may be in whole or in part cared for by the state highway department as hereinafter provided, (b) make possible the prompt payment of principal of and interest on all bonds herein authorized and the making of all payments required to be made for such purpose and for the creation of a reserve therefor and a reserve for contingencies as may be provided in the resolution authorizing or the trust indenture securing the bonds. Such tolls, fees, rents, rates or other charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any bureau, board, commission or agency. When the cost of the bridge, including all principal of and interest on the bonds issued hereunder and all advances made therefor, shall have been fully paid from such tolls, fees, rents, rates and charges, the collection therefor for the use of such bridge shall cease and the bridge shall be maintained and operated by the state as a free bridge.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The commission from time to time shall establish and fix tolls, fees, rents and charges for the use of the bridge and its services and facilities, the proceeds of collection thereof to be used: first, for expenses of operation and maintenance of the bridge, second, for the replenishment of the reserve fund provided for in section 2 to its full required amount of $1,000,000.00, and third, for the payment of the principal of and interest on the refunding bonds when due, which amounts shall be deposited, quarterly or oftener, with the state treasurer and used for such payment. Except as hereinafter provided it is the intent of the legislature that the tolls, fees, rents and charges, as near as is reasonably possible within the limitations herein expressed, shall provide sufficient funds to pay the costs of operating and maintaining the bridge and to pay the principal of and interest on the refunding bonds when due. If any specific taxes or funds of the state, or any portion thereof, except the general fund, are at any time allocated, appropriated or earmarked by law for the payment of the principal of and interest on the refunding bonds, and the cost of operating and maintaining the bridge, the tolls, fees, rents and charges shall be revised to give credit for the moneys so allocated, appropriated or earmarked by law, and if the specific taxes or funds of the state so allocated, appropriated and earmarked are sufficient to provide all necessary funds for the payment thereof including the refunding of the bonds as they mature, no further tolls, fees, rents or charges shall be fixed or collected for such purpose, but the tolls, fees, rents or charges shall be fixed and collected only in such amount as will provide moneys within the limitations expressed in this act to operate and maintain the bridge.
