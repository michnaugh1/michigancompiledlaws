</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, Article V, Section 2, of the Constitution of the state of Michigan of 1963 empowers the Governor to make changes in the organization or in the assignment of functions among its units that he considers necessary for efficient administration; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, the Bureau of Workers' Disability Compensation of the Department of Consumer and Industry Services is the primary state department with regulatory responsibility for the Michigan's workers' compensation program pursuant to Act No. 317 of the Public Acts of 1969, being Section 418.101 et seq. of the Michigan Compiled Laws; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, since the inception of workers' compensation self-insurance in the state of Michigan from its creation by the legislature, through 1998, the Bureau of Workers' Disability Compensation has had sole responsibility for the regulation of both individual self-insured employers and self-insured employer groups; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, self-insured group funds consist of employers in the same industry that jointly and severally guarantee payment of workers' compensation benefits to employees of members of the fund that are injured in the course of their employment, and public employers of the same type of unit that jointly guarantee payment; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, the Bureau of Workers' Disability Compensation under the Workers' Compensation Disability Act, Act No. 317 of the Public Acts of 1969, being Section 418.611(b)(2) of the Michigan Compiled Laws, is required to approve such self-insured group funds before they can provide such coverage; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, Section 2016 of Act No. 457 of the Public Acts of 1998, being Section 500.2016 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, created in the Insurance Code, provides that certain practices by workers' compensation self-insured group funds are unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance; and that enforcement and oversight of these practices would be handled by Michigan Insurance Bureau; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, it is organizationally sound and appropriate to continue to concentrate sole regulation of workers' compensation self-insurance and regulation of group funds specifically in the Bureau of Workers' Disability Compensation; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, the Bureau of Workers' Disability Compensation can more effectively and efficiently carry out the regulation of workers' compensation group funds and the Insurance Bureau's expertise and oversight is and has historically been restricted to insurance carriers under the Insurance Code; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, the Insurance Code, Act No. 218 of the Public Acts of 1956, being Sections 500.2038 and 500.2040 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, provides that the remedy for violation of unfair trade practices as determined by the Insurance Commissioner is revocation of the violator's Certificate of Authority; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, such self-insured group funds are not insurance carriers pursuant to the Insurance Code and therefore do not carry on their activities pursuant to insurance authority certificates issued under the Insurance Code; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>WHEREAS, the Bureau of Workers' Disability Compensation is the proper agency to oversee the determination of such unfair trade practices as applicable to workers' compensation coverage by self-insured group funds as provided in Section 2016 of Act No. 457 of the Public Acts of 1998, being Section 500.2016 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>NOW, THEREFORE, I, John Engler, Governor of the state of Michigan, pursuant to the powers vested in me by the Constitution of the state of Michigan of 1963 and the laws of the state of Michigan do hereby order the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>All the authority, powers, duties, functions, grants and responsibilities of the Insurance Bureau to determine unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts or practices as applied to workers' compensation coverage provided through a self-insurer's group, provided for in Act No. 457 of the Public Acts of 1998, being Section 500.2016 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, are hereby transferred to the Bureau of Workers' Disability Compensation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The Director of the Department of Consumer and Industry Services shall provide executive direction and supervision for the implementation of the transfer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The Director of the Bureau of Workers' Disability Compensation and the Commissioner of the Insurance Bureau shall make internal organizational changes as may be administratively necessary to complete the realignment of responsibilities prescribed by this Order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>All records, personnel, property, grants and unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations and other funds used, held, employed, available or to be made available to the Insurance Bureau for the activities, powers, duties, functions and responsibilities transferred by this Order are hereby transferred to the Bureau of Workers' Disability Compensation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>All rules, orders, contracts, grants and agreements relating to the functions transferred to the Bureau of Workers' Disability Compensation lawfully adopted prior to the effective date of this Order shall continue to be effective until revised, amended or repealed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Any suit, action or other proceeding lawfully commenced by, against or before any entity affected by this Order shall not abate by the reason of the taking effect of this Order.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   All private employers, other than agricultural employers, who regularly employ 3 or more employees at 1 time.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   All private employers, other than agricultural employers, who regularly employ less than 3 employees if at least 1 of them has been regularly employed by that same employer for 35 or more hours per week for 13 weeks or longer during the preceding 52 weeks.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   All public employers, irrespective of the number of persons employed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   All agricultural employers of 3 or more regular employees paid hourly wages or salaries, and not paid on a piecework basis, who are employed 35 or more hours per week by that same employer for 13 or more consecutive weeks during the preceding 52 weeks. Coverage shall apply only to such regularly employed employees. The average weekly wage for such an employee shall be deemed to be the weeks worked in agricultural employment divided into the total wages which the employee has earned from all agricultural occupations during the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the injury, and no other definition pertaining to average weekly wage shall be applicable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   All agricultural employers of 1 or more employees who are employed 35 or more hours per week by that same employer for 5 or more consecutive weeks shall provide for such employees, in accordance with rules established by the director, medical and hospital coverage as set forth in section 315 for all personal injuries arising out of and in the course of employment suffered by such employees not otherwise covered by this act. The provision of such medical and hospital coverage shall not affect any rights of recovery that an employee would otherwise have against an agricultural employer and such right of recovery shall be subject to any defense the agricultural employer might otherwise have. Section 141 shall not apply to cases, other than medical and hospital coverages provided herein, arising under this subdivision nor shall it apply to actions brought against an agricultural employer who is not voluntarily or otherwise subject to this act. No person shall be considered an employee of an agricultural employer if the person is a spouse, child or other member of the employer's family, as defined in subdivision (b) of section 353 residing in the home or on the premises of the agricultural employer.</DIV>

Gallegos v Glaser Crandell Company, 388 Mich 654; 202 NW2d 786 (1972).The agricultural exclusion contained in this section, which was declared unconstitutional in Gallegos v Glaser Crandell Company, 388 Mich 654; 202 NW2d 786 (1972), was void from the date of its enactment. Stanton v Lloyd Hammond Produce Farms, 400 Mich 135; 253 NW2d 114 (1977).Classifications in the workers' compensation act between agricultural employers and other employers are rationally related to the permissible goal of recognizing the economic uniqueness of agricultural employers and do not violate the right of equal protection of the law.

An employer shall be deemed to have intended to injure if the employer had actual knowledge that an injury was certain to occur and willfully disregarded that knowledge. The issue of whether an act was an intentional tort shall be a question of law for the court. This subsection shall not enlarge or reduce rights under law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   As used in this section and section 827, "employee" includes the person injured, his or her personal representatives, and any other person to whom a claim accrues by reason of the injury to, or death of, the employee, and "employer" includes the employer's insurer and a service agent to a self-insured employer insofar as they furnish, or fail to furnish, safety inspections or safety advisory services incident to providing worker's compensation insurance or incident to a self-insured employer's liability servicing contract.</DIV>

If the member of the emergency rescue team is not employed by a state, county, city, village, or township within this state as a police officer, fire fighter, emergency medical technician, or ambulance driver, and is injured in the normal scope of duties, including training, as a member of the emergency rescue team, he or she shall be considered to be an employee of the team.

An individual for whom an employer is required to withhold federal income tax is prima facie considered to perform service in employment under this act.

That individual shall be considered to be receiving the state average weekly wage at the time of injury or death, as last determined under section 355, from the state of Michigan for purposes of calculating the weekly rate of compensation provided under this act, except that if the individual's average weekly wage was greater than the state average weekly wage at the time of injury or death the individual's weekly rate of compensation shall be determined based upon the individual's weekly average wage. The state of Michigan shall exercise all the rights and obligations of an employer and carrier as provided for under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A policy or contract of worker's compensation insurance, by endorsement, may exclude coverage as to any 1 or more named partners or the spouse, child, or parent in the employer's family. A person excluded pursuant to this subsection is not subject to this act and shall not be considered an employee for the purposes of section 115.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An employee who is subject to this act, including an employee covered pursuant to section 121, who is an employee of a limited liability company of not more than 10 members and who is also a manager and member, as defined in section 102 of the Michigan limited liability company act, 1993 PA 23, MCL 450.4102, and who owns at least a 10% interest in that limited liability company, with the consent of the limited liability company as approved by a majority vote of the members, or if the limited liability company has more than 1 manager, all of the managers who are also members, except as otherwise provided in an operating agreement, may elect to be individually excluded from this act by giving a notice of the election in writing to the carrier with the consent of the limited liability company endorsed on the notice. The exclusion remains in effect until revoked by the employee by giving notice in writing to the carrier.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An employee who is subject to this act, including an employee covered pursuant to section 121, who is an employee of a corporation that has not more than 10 stockholders and who is also an officer and stockholder who owns at least 10% of the stock of that corporation, with the consent of the corporation as approved by its board of directors, may elect to be individually excluded from this act by giving a notice of the election in writing to the carrier with the consent of the corporation endorsed on the notice. The exclusion remains in effect until revoked by the employee by giving a notice in writing to the carrier. While the exclusion is in effect, section 141 does not apply to any action brought by the employee against the corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the persons to be excluded from coverage under this act pursuant to subsections (2) to (4) comprise all of the employees of the employer, those persons may elect to be excluded from being considered employees under this act by submitting written notice of that election to the director upon a form prescribed by the director. The exclusion shall remain in effect until revoked by giving written notice to the director.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If any employer subject to the provisions of this act, in this section referred to as the principal, contracts with any other person, in this section referred to as the contractor, who is not subject to this act or who has not complied with the provisions of section 611, and who does not become subject to this act or comply with the provisions of section 611 prior to the date of the injury or death for which claim is made for the execution by or under the contractor of the whole or any part of any work undertaken by the principal, the principal shall be liable to pay to any person employed in the execution of the work any compensation under this act which he or she would have been liable to pay if that person had been immediately employed by the principal. If compensation is claimed from or proceedings are taken against the principal, then, in the application of this act, reference to the principal shall be substituted for reference to the employer, except that the amount of compensation shall be calculated with reference to the earnings of the person under the employer by whom he or she is immediately employed. A contractor shall be deemed to include subcontractors in all cases where the principal gives permission that the work or any part thereof be performed under subcontract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the principal is liable to pay compensation under this section, he or she shall be entitled to be indemnified by the contractor or subcontractor.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Principals willfully acting to circumvent the provisions of this section or section 611 by using coercion, intimidation, deceit, or other means to encourage persons who would otherwise be considered employees within the meaning of this act to pose as contractors for the purpose of evading this section or the requirements of section 611 shall be liable subject to the provisions of section 641. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit an employee from becoming a contractor subject to the provisions of section 151. A principal may demand that the contractor enter into a written agreement with the principal agreeing to reimburse the principal for any loss incurred under this section due to a claim filed pursuant to this act for compensation and other benefits.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An employee, who receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment by an employer who is subject to this act at the time of the injury, shall be paid compensation as provided in this act. A personal injury under this act is compensable if work causes, contributes to, or aggravates pathology in a manner so as to create a pathology that is medically distinguishable from any pathology that existed prior to the injury. In the case of death resulting from the personal injury to the employee, compensation shall be paid to the employee's dependents as provided in this act. Time of injury or date of injury as used in this act in the case of a disease or in the case of an injury not attributable to a single event is the last day of work in the employment in which the employee was last subjected to the conditions that resulted in the employee's disability or death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Mental disabilities and conditions of the aging process, including but not limited to heart and cardiovascular conditions and degenerative arthritis, are compensable if contributed to or aggravated or accelerated by the employment in a significant manner. Mental disabilities are compensable if arising out of actual events of employment, not unfounded perceptions thereof, and if the employee's perception of the actual events is reasonably grounded in fact or reality.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An employee going to or from his or her work, while on the premises where the employee's work is to be performed, and within a reasonable time before and after his or her working hours, is presumed to be in the course of his or her employment. Notwithstanding this presumption, an injury incurred in the pursuit of an activity the major purpose of which is social or recreational is not covered under this act. Any cause of action brought for such an injury is not subject to section 131.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) As used in this chapter: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Disability" means a limitation of an employee's wage earning capacity in work suitable to his or her qualifications and training resulting from a personal injury or work-related disease. A limitation of wage earning capacity occurs only if a personal injury covered under this act results in the employee's being unable to perform all jobs paying the maximum wages in work suitable to that employee's qualifications and training, which includes work that may be performed using the employee's transferable work skills. A disability is total if the employee is unable to earn in any job paying maximum wages in work suitable to the employee's qualifications and training. A disability is partial if the employee retains a wage earning capacity at a pay level less than his or her maximum wages in work suitable to his or her qualifications and training. The establishment of disability does not create a presumption of wage loss.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Except as provided in section 302, "wage earning capacity" means the wages the employee earns or is capable of earning at a job reasonably available to that employee, whether or not wages are actually earned. For the purposes of establishing a limitation of wage earning capacity, an employee has an affirmative duty to seek work reasonably available to that employee, taking into consideration the limitations from the work-related personal injury or disease. A magistrate may consider good-faith job search efforts to determine whether jobs are reasonably available.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Wage loss" means the amount of wages lost due to a disability. The employee shall establish a connection between the disability and reduced wages in establishing the wage loss. Wage loss may be established, among other methods, by demonstrating the employee's good-faith effort to procure work within his or her wage earning capacity. A partially disabled employee who establishes a good-faith effort to procure work but cannot obtain work within his or her wage earning capacity is entitled to weekly benefits under subsection (7) as if totally disabled.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) To establish an initial showing of disability, an employee shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Disclose his or her qualifications and training, including education, skills, and experience, whether or not they are relevant to the job the employee was performing at the time of the injury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Provide evidence as to the jobs, if any, he or she is qualified and trained to perform within the same salary range as his or her maximum wage earning capacity at the time of the injury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Demonstrate that the work-related injury prevents the employee from performing jobs identified as within his or her qualifications and training that pay maximum wages.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If the employee is capable of performing any of the jobs identified in subdivision (c), show that he or she cannot obtain any of those jobs. The evidence shall include a showing of a good-faith attempt to procure post-injury employment if there are jobs at the employee's maximum wage earning capacity at the time of the injury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Once an employee establishes an initial showing of a disability under subsection (5), the employer bears the burden of production of evidence to refute the employee's showing. In satisfying its burden of production of evidence, the employer has a right to discovery if necessary for the employer to sustain its burden and present a meaningful defense. The employee may present additional evidence to challenge the evidence submitted by the employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a personal injury arising out of the course of employment causes total disability and wage loss and the employee is entitled to wage loss benefits, the employer shall pay or cause to be paid to the injured employee as provided in this section weekly compensation equal to 80% of the employee's after-tax average weekly wage, but not more than the maximum weekly rate determined under section 355. Compensation shall be paid for the duration of the disability.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a personal injury arising out of the course of employment causes partial disability and wage loss and the employee is entitled to wage loss benefits, the employer shall pay or cause to be paid to the injured employee as provided in this section weekly compensation equal to 80% of the difference between the injured employee's after-tax average weekly wage before the personal injury and the employee's wage earning capacity after the personal injury, but not more than the maximum weekly rate determined under section 355. Compensation shall be paid for the duration of the disability.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If disability and wage loss are established, entitlement to weekly wage loss benefits shall be determined as applicable pursuant to this section and as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If an employee receives a bona fide offer of reasonable employment from the previous employer, another employer, or through the Michigan unemployment insurance agency and the employee refuses that employment without good and reasonable cause, the employee shall be considered to have voluntarily removed himself or herself from the work force and is not entitled to any wage loss benefits under this act during the period of refusal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If an employee is terminated from reasonable employment for fault of the employee, the employee is considered to have voluntarily removed himself or herself from the work force and is not entitled to any wage loss benefits under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If an employee is employed and the weekly wage of the employee is less than that which the employee received before the date of injury, the employee shall receive weekly benefits under this act equal to 80% of the difference between the injured employee's after-tax weekly wage before the date of injury and the after-tax weekly wage that the injured employee earns after the date of injury, but not more than the maximum weekly rate of compensation, as determined under section 355.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If an employee is employed and the average weekly wage of the employee is equal to or more than the average weekly wage the employee received before the date of injury, the employee is not entitled to any wage loss benefits under this act for the duration of that employment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the employee, after having been employed pursuant to this subsection loses his or her job through no fault of the employee and the employee is still disabled, the employee shall receive compensation under this act as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the employee was employed for less than 100 weeks, the employee shall receive compensation based upon his or her average weekly wage at the time of the original injury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the employee was employed for 100 weeks or more but less than 250 weeks, then after exhausting unemployment benefit eligibility, a worker's compensation magistrate may determine that the employment since the time of the injury has not established a new wage earning capacity and, if the magistrate makes that determination, benefits shall be based on his or her average weekly wage at the original date of injury. If the magistrate does not make that determination, the employee is presumed to have established a post-injury wage earning capacity and benefits shall not be paid based on the wage at the original date of injury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If the employee was employed for 250 weeks or more, the employee is presumed to have established a post-injury wage earning capacity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The Michigan unemployment insurance agency shall notify the agency in writing of the name of any employee who refuses any bona fide offer of reasonable employment. Upon notification to the agency, the agency shall notify the carrier who shall terminate the benefits of the employee pursuant to subsection (9)(a).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) "Reasonable employment", as used in this section, means work that is within the employee's capacity to perform that poses no clear and proximate threat to that employee's health and safety, and that is within a reasonable distance from that employee's residence. The employee's capacity to perform shall not be limited to jobs in work suitable to his or her qualifications and training.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Weekly benefits are not payable during the period of confinement to a person who is incarcerated in a penal institution for violation of the criminal laws of this state or who is confined in a mental institution pending trial for a violation of the criminal laws of this state, if the violation or reason for the confinement occurred while at work and is directly related to the claim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) A person shall not discharge an employee or in any manner discriminate against an employee because the employee filed a complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted a proceeding under this act or because of the exercise by the employee on behalf of himself or herself or others of a right afforded by this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) This section applies to personal injuries and work related diseases occurring on or after June 30, 1985.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The employer shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to an employee who receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment, reasonable medical, surgical, and hospital services and medicines, or other attendance or treatment recognized by the laws of this state as legal, when they are needed. However, an employer is not required to reimburse or cause to be reimbursed charges for an optometric service unless that service was included in the definition of practice of optometry under section 17401 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.17401, as of May 20, 1992 or for a chiropractic service unless that service was included in the definition of practice of chiropractic under section 16401 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.16401, as of January 1, 2009. An employer is not required to reimburse or cause to be reimbursed charges for services performed by a profession that was not licensed or registered by the laws of this state on or before January 1, 1998, but that becomes licensed, registered, or otherwise recognized by the laws of this state after January 1, 1998. An employer is not required to reimburse or cause to be reimbursed charges for a physical therapy service unless that service was provided by a licensed physical therapist or physical therapist assistant under the supervision of a licensed physical therapist pursuant to a prescription from a health care professional who holds a license issued under part 166, 170, 175, or 180 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.16601 to 333.16648, 333.17001 to 333.17084, 333.17501 to 333.17556, and 333.18001 to 333.18058, or the equivalent license issued by another state. Attendant or nursing care shall not be ordered in excess of 56 hours per week if the care is to be provided by the employee's spouse, brother, sister, child, parent, or any combination of these persons. After 28 days from the inception of medical care as provided in this section, the employee may treat with a physician of his or her own choice by giving to the employer the name of the physician and his or her intention to treat with the physician. The employer or the employer's carrier may file a petition objecting to the named physician selected by the employee and setting forth reasons for the objection. If the employer or carrier can show cause why the employee should not continue treatment with the named physician of the employee's choice, after notice to all parties and a prompt hearing by a worker's compensation magistrate, the worker's compensation magistrate may order that the employee discontinue treatment with the named physician or pay for the treatment received from the physician from the date the order is mailed. The employer shall also supply to the injured employee dental service, crutches, artificial limbs, eyes, teeth, eyeglasses, hearing apparatus, and other appliances necessary to cure, so far as reasonably possible, and relieve from the effects of the injury. If the employer fails, neglects, or refuses so to do, the employee shall be reimbursed for the reasonable expense paid by the employee, or payment may be made in behalf of the employee to persons to whom the unpaid expenses may be owing, by order of the worker's compensation magistrate. The worker's compensation magistrate may prorate attorney fees at the contingent fee rate paid by the employee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (1), all fees and other charges for any treatment or attendance, service, devices, apparatus, or medicine under subsection (1), are subject to rules promulgated by the workers' compensation agency pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328. The rules promulgated shall establish schedules of maximum charges for the treatment or attendance, service, devices, apparatus, or medicine, which schedule shall be annually revised. A health facility or health care provider shall be paid either its usual and customary charge for the treatment or attendance, service, devices, apparatus, or medicine, or the maximum charge established under the rules, whichever is less.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The director of the workers' compensation agency shall provide for an advisory committee to aid and assist in establishing the schedules of maximum charges under subsection (2) for charges or fees that are payable under this section. The advisory committee shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the director.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a carrier determines that a health facility or health care provider has made any excessive charges or required unjustified treatment, hospitalization, or visits, the health facility or health care provider shall not receive payment under this chapter from the carrier for the excessive fees or unjustified treatment, hospitalization, or visits, and is liable to return to the carrier the fees or charges already collected. The workers' compensation agency may review the records and medical bills of a health facility or health care provider determined by a carrier to not be in compliance with the schedule of charges or to be requiring unjustified treatment, hospitalization, or office visits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) As used in this section, "utilization review" means the initial evaluation by a carrier of the appropriateness in terms of both the level and the quality of health care and health services provided an injured employee, based on medically accepted standards. A utilization review shall be accomplished by a carrier pursuant to a system established by the workers' compensation agency that identifies the utilization of health care and health services above the usual range of utilization for the health care and health services based on medically accepted standards and provides for acquiring necessary records, medical bills, and other information concerning the health care or health services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) By accepting payment under this chapter, a health facility or health care provider is considered to have agreed to submit necessary records and other information concerning health care or health services provided for utilization review pursuant to this section. The health facilities and health care providers are considered to have agreed to comply with any decision of the workers' compensation agency pursuant to subsection (7). A health facility or health care provider that submits false or misleading records or other information to a carrier or the workers' compensation agency is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 or by imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a carrier determines that a health facility or health care provider improperly overutilized or otherwise rendered or ordered inappropriate health care or health services, or that the cost of the health care or health services was inappropriate, the health facility or health care provider may appeal the determination to the workers' compensation agency pursuant to procedures provided for under the system of utilization review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The workers' compensation agency shall establish criteria or standards for utilization review by rule. A carrier that complies with the criteria or standards as determined by the workers' compensation agency shall be certified by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If a health facility or health care provider provides health care or a health service that is not usually associated with, is longer in duration in time than, is more frequent than, or extends over a greater number of days than that health care or service usually requires for the diagnosis or condition for which the patient is being treated, the carrier may require the health facility or health care provider to explain the necessity or indication for that care or service in writing.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An employee who has suffered an injury covered by this act shall be entitled to prompt medical rehabilitation services. When as a result of the injury he or she is unable to perform work for which he or she has previous training or experience, the employee shall be entitled to such vocational rehabilitation services, including retraining and job placement, as may be reasonably necessary to restore him or her to useful employment. If such services are not voluntarily offered and accepted, the director on his or her own motion or upon application of the employee, carrier, or employer, after affording the parties an opportunity to be heard, may refer the employee to an agency-approved facility for evaluation of the need for, and kind of service, treatment, or training necessary and appropriate to render the employee fit for a remunerative occupation. Upon receipt of such report, the director may order that the training, services, or treatment recommended in the report be provided at the expense of the employer. The director may order that any employee participating in vocational rehabilitation shall receive additional payments for transportation or any extra and necessary expenses during the period and arising out of his or her program of vocational rehabilitation. Vocational rehabilitation training, treatment, or service shall not extend for a period of more than 52 weeks except in cases when, by special order of the director after review, the period may be extended for an additional 52 weeks or portion thereof. If there is an unjustifiable refusal to accept rehabilitation pursuant to a decision of the director, the director shall order a loss or reduction of compensation in an amount determined by the director for each week of the period of refusal, except for specific compensation payable under section 361(1) and (2).</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If death results from the personal injury of an employee, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid, subject to section 375, in 1 of the methods provided in this section, to the dependents of the employee who were wholly dependent upon the employee's earnings for support at the time of the injury, a weekly payment equal to 80% of the employee's after-tax average weekly wage, subject to the maximum and minimum rates of compensation under this act, for a period of 500 weeks from the date of death. If at the expiration of the 500-week period any such wholly or partially dependent person is less than 21 years of age, a worker's compensation magistrate may order the employer to continue to pay the weekly compensation or some portion thereof until the wholly or partially dependent person reaches the age of 21. If the employee leaves dependents only partially dependent upon his or her earnings for support at the time of injury, the weekly compensation to be paid shall be equal to the same proportion of the weekly payments for the benefit of persons wholly dependent as 80% of the amount contributed by the employee to the partial dependents bears to the annual earnings of the deceased at the time of injury.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Except as otherwise provided in this section, a child under the age of 16 years, or 16 years or over if physically or mentally incapacitated from earning, is conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent for support upon the parent with whom he or she is living at the time of the death of that parent. In the event of the death of an employee who has at the time of death a living child by a former spouse or a child who has been deserted by the deceased employee under the age of 16 years, or over if physically or mentally incapacitated from earning, that child shall be conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent for support upon the deceased employee, even though not living with the deceased employee at the time of death. The death benefit shall be divided among all persons who are wholly dependent upon the deceased employee, in equal shares. The total sum due a surviving spouse and his or her own children shall be paid directly to the surviving spouse for his or her own use, and for the use and benefit of his or her own children. If during the time compensation payments continue, a worker's compensation magistrate finds that the surviving spouse is not properly caring for those children, the worker's compensation magistrate shall order the shares of the children to be thereafter paid to their guardian or legal representative for their use and benefit, instead of to their father or mother. In all cases the sums due to the children by the former spouse of the deceased employee shall be paid to their guardians or legal representatives for the use and benefit of those children. In all other cases questions of dependency, in whole or in part, shall be determined in accordance with the facts at the time of the injury. If a deceased employee leaves a person wholly dependent upon him or her for support, that person shall be entitled to the whole death benefit and persons partially dependent, if any, shall receive no part thereof, while the person wholly dependent is living. All persons wholly dependent upon a deceased employee, whether by conclusive presumption or as a matter of fact, shall be entitled to share equally in the death benefit in accordance with the provisions of this section. If there is no one wholly dependent or if the death of all persons wholly dependent occurs before all compensation is paid, and there is only 1 person partially dependent, that person is entitled to compensation according to the extent of his or her dependency; and if there is more than 1 person partially dependent, the death benefit shall be divided among them according to the relative extent of their dependency. A person shall not be considered a dependent unless he or she is a member of the family of the deceased employee, or unless such person bears to the deceased employee the relation of widower or widow, lineal descendant, ancestor, or brother or sister.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Upon the remarriage of a dependent wife receiving compensation, such payments shall cease upon the payment to her of the balance of the compensation to which she would otherwise have been entitled but not to exceed the sum of $500.00, and further compensation, if any, shall be payable to the person either wholly or partially dependent upon deceased for support at his death as provided in section 331(b). A worker's compensation magistrate shall determine the amount of compensation or portion thereof that shall be payable weekly to such wholly or partially dependent person for the remaining weeks of compensation. Where, at the expiration of the 500-week period, any such wholly or partially dependent person is less than 18 years of age, a worker's compensation magistrate may order the employer to continue to pay the weekly compensation, or some portion thereof, until such wholly or partially dependent person reaches the age of 18. The payment of compensation to any dependent child shall cease when the child reaches the age of 18 years, if at the age of 18 years he or she is neither physically nor mentally incapacitated from earning, or when the child reaches the age of 16 years and thereafter is self-supporting for 6 months. If the child ceases to be self-supporting thereafter, the dependency shall be reinstated.

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>418.354 Coordination of benefits.</B><P>Sec. 354.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) This section applies if either weekly or lump sum payments are made to an employee as a result of liability under section 301(7) or (8), 351, or 835 with respect to the same time period for which the employee also received or is receiving old-age insurance benefit payments under the social security act, 42 USC 301 to 1397f; payments under a self-insurance plan, a wage continuation plan, or a disability insurance policy provided by the employer; or pension or retirement payments under a plan or program established or maintained by the employer. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the employer's obligation to pay or cause to be paid weekly benefits other than specific loss benefits under section 361(2) and (3) shall be reduced by these amounts:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Fifty percent of the amount of the old-age insurance benefits received or being received under the social security act, chapter 531, 49 Stat. 620. However, if the injured employee has been receiving old-age insurance benefit payments under the social security act, chapter 531, 49 Stat. 620, before the date of the personal injury or work-related disease, then in no event shall the weekly benefits payable after the reduction provided by this subdivision be less than 50% of the weekly benefits otherwise payable without the reduction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The after-tax amount of the payments received or being received under a self-insurance plan, a wage continuation plan, or under a disability insurance policy provided by the same employer from whom benefits under section 301(7) or (8), 351, or 835 are received if the employee did not contribute directly to the plan or to the payment of premiums regarding the disability insurance policy. If the self-insurance plans, wage continuation plans, or disability insurance policies are entitled to repayment in the event of a worker's compensation benefit recovery, the carrier shall satisfy that repayment out of funds the carrier has received through the coordination of benefits provided for under this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, attorney fees shall be paid pursuant to section 821 to the attorney who secured the worker's compensation recovery.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The proportional amount, based on the ratio of the employer's contributions to the total insurance premiums for the policy period involved, of the after-tax amount of the payments received or being received by the employee pursuant to a disability insurance policy provided by the same employer from whom benefits under section 301(7) or (8), 351, or 835 are received, if the employee did contribute directly to the payment of premiums regarding the disability insurance policy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Subject to subsection (12), the after-tax amount of the pension or retirement payments received or being received by the employee, or which the employee is currently eligible to receive if the employee has suffered total and permanent disability and has reached full retirement age, pursuant to a plan or program established or maintained by the same employer from whom benefits under section 301(7) or (8), 351, or 835 are received, if the employee did not contribute directly to the pension or retirement plan or program. Subsequent increases in a pension or retirement program shall not affect the coordination of these benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The proportional amount, based on the ratio of the employer's contributions to the total contributions to the plan or program, of the after-tax amount of the pension or retirement payments received or being received by the employee pursuant to a plan or program established or maintained by the same employer from whom benefits under section 301(7) or (8), 351, or 835 are received, if the employee did contribute directly to the pension or retirement plan or program. Subsequent increases in a pension or retirement program shall not affect the coordination of these benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) For those employers who do not provide a pension plan, the proportional amount, based on the ratio of the employer's contributions to the total contributions made to a qualified profit sharing plan under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code or any successor to section 401(a) of the internal revenue code covering a profit sharing plan which provides for the payment of benefits only upon retirement, disability, death, or other separation of employment to the extent that benefits are vested under the plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) To satisfy any remaining obligations under section 301(7) or (8), 351, or 835, the employer shall pay or cause to be paid to the employee the balance due in either weekly or lump sum payments after the application of subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In the application of subsection (1) any credit or reduction shall occur pursuant to this section and all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The agency shall promulgate rules to provide for notification by an employer or carrier to an employee of possible eligibility for social security benefits and the requirements for establishing proof of application for those benefits. Notification shall be promptly mailed to the employee after the date on which by reason of age the employee may be entitled to social security benefits. A copy of the notification of possible eligibility shall be filed with the agency by the employer or carrier.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Within 30 days after receipt of the notification of possible employee eligibility the employee shall:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Apply for social security benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Provide the employer or carrier with proof of that application.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Provide the employer or carrier with an authority for release of information which shall be utilized by the employer or carrier to obtain necessary benefit entitlement and amount information from the social security administration. The authority for release of information shall be effective for 1 year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the employee fails to provide the proof of application or the authority for release of information as prescribed in subsection (3), the employer or carrier, with the approval of the agency, may discontinue the compensation benefits payable to the employee under section 301(7) or (8), 351, or 835 until the proof of application and the authority for release of information is provided. Compensation benefits withheld shall be reimbursed to the employee upon providing the required proof of application, or the authority for release of information, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the employer or carrier is required to submit a new authority for release of information to the social security administration in order to receive information necessary to comply with this section, the employee shall provide the new authority for release of information within 30 days of a request by the employer or carrier. If the employee fails to provide the new authority for release of information, the employer or carrier, with the approval of the agency, may discontinue benefits until the authority for release of information is provided as prescribed in this subsection. Compensation benefits withheld shall be reimbursed to the employee upon providing the new authority for release of information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Within 30 days after either the date of first payment of compensation benefits under section 301(7) or (8), 351, or 835, or 30 days after the date of application for any benefit under subsection (1)(b), (c), (d), or (e), whichever is later, the employee shall provide the employer or carrier with a properly executed authority for release of information, which shall be utilized by the employer or carrier to obtain necessary benefit entitlement and amount information from the appropriate source. The authority for release of information is effective for 1 year. Failure of the employee to provide a properly executed authority for release of information allows the employer or carrier with the approval of the agency to discontinue the compensation benefits payable under section 301 (7) or (8), 351, or 835 to the employee until the authority for release of information is provided. Compensation benefits withheld shall be reimbursed to the employee upon providing the required authority for release of information. If the employer or carrier is required to submit a new authority for release of information to the appropriate source in order to receive information necessary to comply with this section, the employee shall provide a properly executed new authority for release of information within 30 days after a request by the employer or carrier. Failure of the employee to provide a properly executed new authority for release of information allows the employer or carrier with the approval of the agency to discontinue benefits under section 301(7) or (8), 351, or 835 until the authority for release of information is provided as prescribed in this subsection. Compensation benefits withheld shall be reimbursed to the employee upon the providing of the new authority for release of information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A credit or reduction under this section shall not occur because of an increase granted by the social security administration as a cost of living adjustment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Except as provided in subsections (4), (5), and (6), a credit or reduction of benefits otherwise payable for any week shall not be taken under this section until there has been a determination of the benefit amount otherwise payable to the employee under section 301(7) or (8), 351, or 835 and the employee has begun receiving the benefit payments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any benefit payments under the social security act, or any fund, policy, or program as specified in subsection (1) that the employee has received or is receiving after March 31, 1982 and during a period in which the employee was receiving unreduced compensation benefits under section 301(7) or (8), 351, or 835 shall be considered to have created an overpayment of compensation benefits for that period. The employer or carrier shall calculate the amount of the overpayment and send a notice of overpayment and a request for reimbursement to the employee. Failure by the employee to reimburse the employer or carrier within 30 days after the mailing date of the notice of request for reimbursement allows the employer or carrier with the approval of the agency to discontinue 50% of future weekly compensation payments under section 301(7) or (8), 351, or 835. The compensation payments withheld shall be credited against the amount of the overpayment. Payment of the appropriate compensation benefit shall resume when the total amount of the overpayment has been withheld.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The employer or carrier taking a credit or making a reduction as provided in this section shall immediately report to the agency the amount of any credit or reduction, and as requested by the agency, furnish to the agency satisfactory proof of the basis for a credit or reduction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Disability insurance benefit payments under the social security act shall be considered to be payments from funds provided by the employer and to be primary payments on the employer's obligation under section 301(7) or (8), 351, or 835 as old-age benefit payments under the social security act are considered pursuant to this section. The coordination of social security disability benefits shall commence on the date of the award certificate of the social security disability benefits. Any accrued social security disability benefits shall not be coordinated. However, social security disability insurance benefits shall only be so considered if section 224 of the social security act, 42 USC 424a, is revised so that a reduction of social security disability insurance benefits is not made because of the receipt of worker's compensation benefits by the employee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Nothing in this section shall be considered to compel an employee to apply for early federal social security old-age insurance benefits or to apply for early or reduced pension or retirement benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) As used in this section, "after-tax amount" means the gross amount of any benefit under subsection (1)(b), (1)(c), (1)(d), or (1)(e) reduced by the prorated weekly amount which would have been paid, if any, under the federal insurance contributions act, 26 USC 3101 to 3128, and state income tax and federal income tax, calculated on an annual basis using as the number of exemptions the disabled employee's dependents plus the employee, and without excess itemized deductions. In determining the "after-tax amount" the tables provided for in section 313(2) shall be used. The gross amount of any benefit under subsection (1)(b), (1)(c), (1)(d), or (1)(e) shall be presumed to be the same as the average weekly wage for purposes of the table. The applicable 80% of after-tax amount as provided in the table will be multiplied by 1.25 which will be conclusive for determining the "after-tax amount" of benefits under subsection (1)(b), (1)(c), (1)(d), or (1)(e).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) This section does not apply to any payments received or to be received under a disability pension plan provided by the same employer, which plan is in existence on March 31, 1982. Any disability pension plan entered into or renewed after March 31, 1982 may provide that the payments under that disability pension plan provided by the employer shall not be coordinated pursuant to this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) With respect to volunteer fire fighters, volunteer safety patrol officers, volunteer civil defense workers, and volunteer ambulance drivers and attendants who are considered employees for purposes of this act pursuant to section 161(1)(a), the reduction of weekly benefits provided for disability insurance payments under subsection (1)(b) and (c) and subsection (11) may be waived by the employer. An employer that is not a self-insurer may make the waiver provided for under this subsection only at the time a worker's compensation insurance policy is entered into or renewed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) This section does not apply to payments made to an employee as a result of liability pursuant to section 361(2) and (3) for the specific loss period set forth therein. It is the intent of the legislature that, because benefits under section 361(2) and (3) are benefits that recognize human factors substantially in addition to the wage loss concept, coordination of benefits should not apply to those benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) The decision of the Michigan Supreme Court in Franks v White Pine Copper Division, 422 Mich 636 (1985) is declared to have been erroneously rendered insofar as it interprets this section, it having been and being the legislative intention not to coordinate payments under this section resulting from liability pursuant to section 301(7) or (8), 351, or 835 for personal injuries occurring before March 31, 1982. It is the purpose of the amendatory act that added this subsection to so affirm. This remedial and curative amendment shall be liberally construed to effectuate this purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) This section applies only to payments resulting from liability pursuant to section 301 (7) or (8), 351, or 835 for personal injuries occurring on or after March 31, 1982. Any payments made to an employee resulting from liability pursuant to section 301(7) or (8), 351, or 835 for a personal injury occurring before March 31, 1982 that have not been coordinated under this section as of the effective date of this subsection shall not be coordinated, shall not be considered to have created an overpayment of compensation benefits, and shall not be subject to reimbursement to the employer or carrier.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) Notwithstanding any other section of this act, any payments made to an employee resulting from liability pursuant to section 301(7) or (8), 351, or 835 for a personal injury occurring before March 31, 1982 that have been coordinated before May 14, 1987 shall be considered to be an underpayment of compensation benefits, and the amounts withheld pursuant to coordination shall be reimbursed with interest, by July 13, 1987, to the employee by the employer or carrier.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) Notwithstanding any other section of this act, any employee who has paid an employer or carrier money alleged by the employer or carrier to be owed the employer or carrier because that employee's benefits had not been coordinated under this section and whose date of personal injury was before March 31, 1982 shall be reimbursed with interest, by July 13, 1987, that money by the employer or carrier.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) If any portion of this section is subsequently found to be unconstitutional or in violation of applicable law, it shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An injured employee who, at the time of the personal injury, is entitled to a rate of compensation less than 50% of the then applicable state average weekly wage as determined for the year in which the injury occurred pursuant to section 355, may be entitled to an increase in benefits after 2 years of continuous disability. After 2 years of continuous disability, the employee may petition for a hearing at which the employee may present evidence that, by virtue of the employee's age, education, training, experience, or other documented evidence which would fairly reflect the employee's earning capacity, the employee's earnings would have been expected to increase. Upon presentation of this evidence, a worker's compensation magistrate may order an adjustment of the compensation rate up to 50% of the state average weekly wage for the year in which the employee's injury occurred. The adjustment of compensation, if ordered, shall be effective as of the date of the employee's petition for the hearing. The adjustments provided in this subsection shall be paid by the carrier on a weekly basis. However, the carrier, the self-insurers' security fund, and the private employer group self-insurers security fund shall be entitled to reimbursement for these payments from the second injury fund created in section 501.

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>418.371 Weekly loss in wages; average weekly wage.</B><P>
</P>
<P>Sec. 371.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The weekly loss in wages referred to in this act shall consist of the percentage of the average weekly earnings of the injured employee computed according to this section as fairly represents the proportionate extent of the impairment of the employee's earning capacity in the employments covered by this act in which the employee was working at the time of the personal injury. The weekly loss in wages shall be fixed as of the time of the personal injury, and determined considering the nature and extent of the personal injury. The compensation payable, when added to the employee's wage earning capacity after the personal injury in the same or other employments, shall not exceed the employee's average weekly earnings at the time of the injury.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   As used in this act, "average weekly wage" means the weekly wage earned by the employee at the time of the employee's injury in all employment, inclusive of overtime, premium pay, and cost of living adjustment, and exclusive of any fringe or other benefits which continue during the disability. Any fringe or other benefit which does not continue during the disability shall be included for purposes of determining an employee's average weekly wage to the extent that the inclusion of the fringe or other benefit will not result in a weekly benefit amount which is greater than 2/3 of the state average weekly wage at the time of injury. The average weekly wage shall be determined by computing the total wages paid in the highest paid 39 weeks of the 52 weeks immediately preceding the date of injury, and dividing by 39.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the employee worked less than 39 weeks in the employment in which the employee was injured, the average weekly wage shall be based upon the total wages earned by the employee divided by the total number of weeks actually worked. For purposes of this subsection, only those weeks in which work is performed shall be considered in computing the total wages earned and the number of weeks actually worked.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If an employee sustains a compensable injury before completing his or her first work week, the average weekly wage shall be calculated by determining the number of hours of work per week contracted for by that employee multiplied by the employee's hourly rate, or the weekly salary contracted for by the employee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the hourly earning of the employee cannot be ascertained, or if the pay has not been designated for the work required, the wage, for the purpose of calculating compensation, shall be taken to be the usual wage for similar services if the services are rendered by paid employees.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If there are special circumstances under which the average weekly wage cannot justly be determined by applying subsections (2) to (5), an average weekly wage may be computed by dividing the aggregate earnings during the year before the injury by the number of days when work was performed and multiplying that daily wage by the number of working days customary in the employment, but not less than 5.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The average weekly wage as determined under this section shall be rounded to the nearest dollar.</DIV>

Weekly benefits shall be apportioned as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the employment which caused the personal injury or death provided more than 80% of the injured employee's average weekly wages at the time of the personal injury or death, the insurer or self-insurer is liable for all of the weekly benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the employment which caused the personal injury or death provided 80% or less of the employee's average weekly wage at the time of the personal injury or death, the insurer or self-insurer is liable for that portion of the employee's weekly benefits as bears the same ratio to his or her total weekly benefits as the average weekly wage from the employment which caused the personal injury or death bears to his or her total weekly wages. The second injury fund is separately but dependently liable for the remainder of the weekly benefits. The insurer or self-insurer has the obligation to pay the employee or the employee's dependents at the full rate of compensation. The second injury fund shall reimburse the insurer or self-insurer quarterly for the second injury fund's portion of the benefits due the employee or the employee's dependents.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) For purposes of apportionment under this section, only wages that were reported to the internal revenue service shall be considered, and the reports of wages to the internal revenue service are conclusive for the purpose of apportionment under this section.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An employee who terminates active employment and is receiving nondisability pension or retirement benefits under either a private or governmental pension or retirement program, including old-age benefits under the social security act, 42 U.S.C. 301 to 1397f, that was paid by or on behalf of an employer from whom weekly benefits under this act are sought shall be presumed not to have a loss of earnings or earning capacity as the result of a compensable injury or disease under either this chapter or chapter 4. This presumption may be rebutted only by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee is unable, because of a work related disability, to perform work suitable to the employee's qualifications, including training or experience. This standard of disability supersedes other applicable standards used to determine disability under either this chapter or chapter 4.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The death of the injured employee before the expiration of the period within which he or she would receive weekly payments shall be considered to end the disability and all liability for the remainder of such payments which he or she would have received in case he or she had lived shall be terminated, but the employer shall thereupon be liable for the following death benefits in lieu of any further disability indemnity.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the injury received by such employee was the proximate cause of his or her death, and the deceased employee leaves dependents, as hereinbefore specified, wholly or partially dependent on him or her for support, the death benefit shall be a sum sufficient, when added to the indemnity which at the time of death has been paid or becomes payable under the provisions of this act to the deceased employee, to make the total compensation for the injury and death exclusive of medical, surgical, hospital services, medicines, and rehabilitation services, and expenses furnished as provided in sections 315 and 319, equal to the full amount which such dependents would have been entitled to receive under the provisions of section 321, in case the injury had resulted in immediate death. Such benefits shall be payable in the same manner as they would be payable under the provisions of section 321 had the injury resulted in immediate death.</DIV>

In such case, the benefits payable up to time of death shall be paid to the same beneficiaries and in the same amounts as would have been payable if the employee had suffered a compensable injury resulting in death.</DIV>

In case of the death of the employee, the claim shall be made within 2 years after death. The employee shall provide a notice of injury to the employer within 90 days after the happening of the injury, or within 90 days after the employee knew, or should have known, of the injury.

In the event of physical or mental incapacity of the employee, the notice and claim shall be made within 2 years from the time the injured employee is not physically or mentally incapacitated from making the claim. A claim shall not be valid or effectual for any purpose under this chapter unless made within 2 years after the later of the date of injury, the date disability manifests itself, or the last day of employment with the employer against whom claim is being made. If an employee claims benefits for a work injury and is thereafter compensated for the disability by worker's compensation or benefits other than worker's compensation, or is provided favored work by the employer because of the disability, the period of time within which a claim shall be made for benefits under this act shall be extended by the time during which the benefits are paid or the favored work is provided.</div>

If the employee has had other physical examinations relative to the injury but not at the request of the employer or the carrier, he or she shall furnish to the employer or the carrier a complete and correct copy of the report of each such physical examination, if so requested, within 15 days of the request. If a party fails to provide a medical report regarding an examination or medical treatment, that party shall be precluded from taking the medical testimony of that physician only. The opposing party may, however, elect to take the deposition of that physician.</DIV>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><Center>Chapter 4<BR> OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES AND DISABLEMENTS <BR> </Center><BR><BR><B>418.401 Definitions; determination of entitlement to weekly wage lost benefits; notice of employee refusing offer of employment; termination of benefits; “reasonable employment” defined; personal injuries or work related diseases to which section applicable.</B><P>Sec. 401.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As used in this chapter, "disability" means a limitation of an employee's wage earning capacity in work suitable to his or her qualifications and training resulting from a personal injury or work related disease. A limitation of wage earning capacity occurs only if a personal injury covered under this act results in the employee's being unable to perform all jobs paying the maximum wages in work suitable to that employee's qualifications and training, which includes work that may be performed using the employee's transferable work skills. A disability is total if the employee is unable to earn in any job paying maximum wages in work suitable to the employee's qualifications and training. A disability is partial if the employee retains a wage earning capacity at a pay level less than his or her maximum wages in work suitable to his or her qualifications and training. The establishment of disability does not create a presumption of wage loss.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) As used in this chapter:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Disablement" means the event of becoming so disabled.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Personal injury" includes a disease or disability that is due to causes and conditions that are characteristic of and peculiar to the business of the employer and that arises out of and in the course of the employment. An ordinary disease of life to which the public is generally exposed outside of the employment is not compensable. A personal injury under this act is compensable if work causes, contributes to, or aggravates pathology in a manner so as to create a pathology that is medically distinguishable from any pathology that existed prior to the injury. Mental disabilities and conditions of the aging process, including but not limited to heart and cardiovascular conditions, and degenerative arthritis shall be compensable if contributed to or aggravated or accelerated by the employment in a significant manner. Mental disabilities shall be compensable when arising out of actual events of employment, not unfounded perceptions thereof, and if the employee's perception of the actual events is reasonably grounded in fact or reality. A hernia to be compensable must be clearly recent in origin and result from a strain arising out of and in the course of the employment and be promptly reported to the employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Except as provided in section 302, "wage earning capacity" means the wages the employee earns or is capable of earning at a job reasonably available to that employee, whether or not actually earned. For the purposes of establishing wage earning capacity, an employee has an affirmative duty to seek work reasonably available to that employee, taking into consideration the limitations from the work-related personal injury or disease. A magistrate may consider good-faith job search efforts to determine whether jobs are reasonably available.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Wage loss" means the amount of wages lost due to a disability. The employee shall establish a connection between the disability and reduced wages in establishing the wage loss. Wage loss may be established, among other methods, by demonstrating the employee's good-faith effort to procure work within his or her wage earning capacity. A partially disabled employee who establishes a good-faith effort to procure work but cannot obtain work within his or her wage earning capacity is entitled to weekly benefits under subsection (5) as if totally disabled.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) To establish an initial showing of disability, an employee shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Disclose his or her qualifications and training, including education, skills, and experience, whether or not they are relevant to the job the employee was performing at the time of the injury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Provide evidence as to the jobs, if any, he or she is qualified and trained to perform within the same salary range as his or her maximum wage earning capacity at the time of the injury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Demonstrate that the work-related injury prevents the employee from performing jobs identified as within his or her qualifications and training that pay maximum wages.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If the employee is capable of performing any of the jobs identified in subdivision (c), show that he or she cannot obtain any of those jobs. The evidence shall include a showing of a good-faith attempt to procure postinjury employment if there are jobs at the employee's maximum wage earning capacity at the time of the injury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Once an employee establishes an initial showing of a disability under subsection (3), the employer bears the burden of production of evidence to refute the employee's showing. In satisfying its burden of production of evidence, the employer has a right to discovery if necessary for the employer to sustain its burden and present a meaningful defense. The employee may present additional evidence to challenge the evidence submitted by the employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a personal injury arising out of the course of employment causes total disability and wage loss and the employee is entitled to wage loss benefits, the employer shall pay or cause to be paid to the injured employee as provided in this section weekly compensation equal to 80% of the employee's after-tax average weekly wage, but not more than the maximum weekly rate determined under section 355. Compensation shall be paid for the duration of the disability.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a personal injury arising out of the course of employment causes partial disability and wage loss and the employee is entitled to wage loss benefits, the employer shall pay or cause to be paid to the injured employee as provided in this section weekly compensation equal to 80% of the difference between the injured employee's after-tax average weekly wage before the personal injury and the employee's wage earning capacity after the personal injury, but not more than the maximum weekly rate determined under section 355. Compensation shall be paid for the duration of the disability.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If disability and wage loss are established, entitlement to weekly wage loss benefits shall be determined as applicable pursuant to this section and as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If an employee receives a bona fide offer of reasonable employment from the previous employer, another employer, or through the Michigan unemployment insurance agency and the employee refuses that employment without good and reasonable cause, the employee shall be considered to have voluntarily removed himself or herself from the work force and is no longer entitled to any wage loss benefits under this act during the period of refusal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If an employee is terminated from reasonable employment for fault of the employee, the employee is considered to have voluntarily removed himself or herself from the work force and is not entitled to any wage loss benefits under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If an employee is employed and the average weekly wage of the employee is less than that which the employee received before the date of injury, the employee shall receive weekly benefits under this act equal to 80% of the difference between the injured employee's after-tax weekly wage before the date of injury and the after-tax weekly wage that the injured employee earns after the date of injury, but not more than the maximum weekly rate of compensation, as determined under section 355.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If an employee is employed and the average weekly wage of the employee is equal to or more than the average weekly wage the employee received before the date of injury, the employee is not entitled to any wage loss benefits under this act for the duration of that employment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the employee, after having been employed pursuant to this subsection, loses his or her job through no fault of the employee and the employee is still disabled, the employee shall receive compensation under this act as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the employee was employed for less than 100 weeks, the employee shall receive compensation based upon his or her wage at the time of the original injury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the employee was employed for 100 weeks or more but less than 250 weeks, then after the employee exhausts unemployment benefit eligibility, a worker's compensation magistrate may determine that the employment since the time of the injury has not established a new wage earning capacity and, if the magistrate makes that determination, benefits shall be based on the employee's wage at the original date of injury. If the magistrate does not make that determination, the employee is presumed to have established a post-injury wage earning capacity and benefits shall not be paid based on the wage at the original date of injury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If the employee was employed for 250 weeks or more, the employee is presumed to have established a post-injury wage earning capacity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The Michigan unemployment insurance agency shall notify the agency in writing of the name of any employee who refuses any bona fide offer of reasonable employment. Upon notification to the agency, the agency shall notify the carrier who shall terminate the benefits of the employee pursuant to subsection (7)(a).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) As used in this section, "reasonable employment" means work that is within the employee's capacity to perform that poses no clear and proximate threat to that employee's health and safety, and that is within a reasonable distance from that employee's residence. The employee's capacity to perform shall not be limited to work suitable to his or her qualifications and training.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) This section shall apply to personal injuries or work related diseases occurring on or after June 30, 1985.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) For a member of a fully paid fire department of an airport operated by a county, public airport authority, or state university or college; a member of a fully paid fire or police department of a city, township, or village employed and compensated upon a full-time basis; a member of a fully paid public fire authority employed and compensated upon a full-time basis; a county sheriff and the deputies of the county sheriff; a member of the state police; a conservation officer; or an officer of the motor carrier enforcement division of the department of state police, "personal injury" includes respiratory and heart diseases, or illnesses resulting therefrom, that develop or manifest themselves during a period while the member of the department is in the active service of the department and that result from the performance of duties for the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A full-time member, and, beginning January 1, 2022 for a cancer described in this subsection diagnosed on or after January 1, 2022, a part-time, paid on-call, or volunteer member, of a fire department or public fire authority, and, beginning January 1, 2022 for a cancer described in this subsection diagnosed on or after January 1, 2022, a former member who was a full-time, part-time, paid on-call, or volunteer member of a fire department or public fire authority, who has or had 60 months or more active service in the department or public fire authority at the time the cancer manifests itself, and who is or was exposed to the hazards incidental to fire suppression, rescue, or emergency medical services in the performance of his or her work-related duties with the department or authority shall suspend a claim he or she may have against his or her employer under this act and may claim like benefits from the Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund created under subsection (6) for any respiratory tract, bladder, skin, brain, kidney, blood, thyroid, testicular, prostate, lymphatic, ovarian, breast, or non-HPV cervical cancer. Beginning January 1, 2022 for a cancer described in this subsection diagnosed on or after January 1, 2022, a full-time, part-time, paid on-call, volunteer, or former forest fire officer or fire/crash rescue officer who has or had 60 months or more active service at the time the cancer manifests itself, and who is or was exposed to the hazards incidental to fire suppression, rescue, or emergency medical services in the performance of his or her work-related duties shall suspend a claim he or she may have against his or her employer under this act and may claim like benefits from the Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund created under subsection (6) for any respiratory tract, bladder, skin, brain, kidney, blood, thyroid, testicular, prostate, or lymphatic, ovarian, breast, or non-HPV cervical cancer. The cancers described in this subsection are presumed to arise out of and in the course of employment only with respect to a claim against the fund and in the absence of non-work-related causation or specific incidents that establish a cause independent of the employment. Neither mere evidence that the condition was preexisting, nor an abstract medical opinion that the employment was not the cause of the disease or condition, is sufficient to overcome the presumption for purposes of a claim against the Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund. The presumption under this subsection may be rebutted by scientific evidence that the member or former member of the fire department or public fire authority was a substantial and consistent user of cigarettes or other tobacco products within the 10 years immediately preceding the date of injury, and that this use was a significant factor in the cause, aggravation, or progression of the cancer. The suspension of the member's or former member's claim against his or her employer under this subsection is in effect only during the period the member receives like benefits from the Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund. If a redemption agreement between the Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund and the claimant is approved, the suspension of a claim against an employer under this subsection continues indefinitely. A claimant may not receive benefits covering the same time period from both the Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund and the employer. The presumption created in this subsection applies only to a claim for like benefits against the Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund. For purposes of a claim against the Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund created under subsection (6), a fire department or public fire authority is considered the employer of a volunteer member. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Respiratory and heart diseases or illnesses resulting therefrom as described in subsection (1) are presumed to arise out of and in the course of employment in the absence of evidence to the contrary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) As a condition precedent to filing an application for benefits, a claimant described in subsection (1) or a claimant under subsection (2) must first apply for and do all things necessary to qualify for any pension benefits to which he or she, or his or her decedent, may be entitled or must demonstrate that he or she, or his or her decedent, is ineligible for any pension benefits. If a final determination is made that pension benefits will not be awarded or that the claimant or his or her decedent is ineligible for any pension benefits, then the designation of "personal injury" as provided in subsection (1) or the presumption under subsection (2) applies. The employer, employee, or former member described in subsection (2) may request 2 copies of the determination denying pension benefits, 1 copy of which must be filed with the workers' compensation agency upon request.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If an employee described in subsection (1) or (2) or a former member described in subsection (2) is eligible for any pension benefits, that eligibility does not prohibit the employee or dependents of that employee from receiving benefits under section 315 for the medical expenses or portion of medical expenses that are not provided for by the pension program. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund is created as a separate fund in the state treasury. The state treasurer may receive money or other assets from any source for deposit into the fund. The state treasurer shall direct the investment of the fund. The state treasurer shall credit to the fund interest and earnings from fund investments. The director shall be the administrator of the fund for auditing purposes. The director shall expend money from the fund only for the purpose of paying claims authorized under subsection (2) and costs of administration. The department of treasury shall cause to be paid from the Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund those amounts and at those times as are prescribed by the director to pay claims under subsection (2) pursuant to this subsection and subsection (7). Money in the fund at the close of the fiscal year remains in the fund and does not lapse to the general fund. If there is insufficient money in the fund to pay claims authorized under subsection (2), claims that are approved but not paid must be paid if fund revenues become available, and those claims must be paid before subsequently approved claims. The director shall develop and implement a process to notify the legislature that money in the Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund may be insufficient to cover future claims when the director reasonably believes that within 60 days the money in the fund will be insufficient to pay claims. The process must, at a minimum, do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Identify a specific date by which the money in the fund will become insufficient to pay claims.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Outline a clear process indicating the order in which claims pending with the fund will be paid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Outline a clear process indicating the order in which claims that were pending with the fund when money became insufficient will be paid, if money subsequently becomes available.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The director shall develop the application, approval, and compliance process necessary to operate and manage the Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund. The director shall develop and implement the use of an application form to be used by a claimant for benefits payable by the fund under subsection (2). When a claim under subsection (2) is received, the director shall notify the employer against whom a claim is suspended or the carrier. The employer or carrier may access all information the agency receives respecting the claim and may request that the agency obtain specific additional information. The fund standards, guidelines, templates, and any other forms used by the director to implement the Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund must be posted and maintained on the department's website. The director shall review and consider claims in the order in which they are received and shall approve or deny a claim within 30 days after receipt of the claim. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The director shall submit an annual report to the state budget director and the senate and house of representatives standing committees on appropriations not later than April 1 of each year that includes, but is not limited to, all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The total number of claims received under the Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund in the immediately preceding calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The number of claims approved and the total dollar amount of claims paid by the Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund in the immediately preceding calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The costs of administering the Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund in the immediately preceding calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) By March 31 of each year, the worker's compensation agency shall report to the chairs of the appropriations committees of the senate and the house of representatives the estimated amount of both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The anticipated cost of benefits in the next fiscal year for claims authorized under subsection (2) and payable by the Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The amount of any anticipated shortfall in the Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund that would prevent payment of claims under subsection (6) for the current fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The Christopher R. Slezak first responder presumed coverage fund has the same rights under this act as an employer or carrier.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   No compensation shall be payable for an occupational disease if the employee at the time of entering into the employment of the employer by whom the compensation would otherwise be payable, or thereafter, wilfully and falsely represents in writing that he has not previously suffered from the disease which is the cause of the disability or death. Where an occupational disease is aggravated by any other disease or infirmity, not itself compensable, or where disability or death from any other cause, not itself compensable, is aggravated, prolonged, accelerated or in any way contributed to by an occupational disease, the compensation payable shall be a proportion only of the compensation that would be payable if the occupational disease were the sole cause of the disability or death as such occupational disease, as a causative factor, bearing to all the causes of such disability or death, such reduction in compensation to be effected by reducing the number of weekly payments or the amounts of such payments, as under the circumstances of the particular case may be for the best interest of the claimant or claimants.</DIV>

The self-insurers' security fund may redeem any claim by a former employee against an employer described in this subsection if the claimant voluntarily agrees.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The trustees may compromise the liability of the silicosis, dust disease, and logging industry compensation fund by entering into a redemption of liability directly with the employee if, in the judgment of the trustees, it is in the employee's best interest to do so. Redemption of liability shall terminate the liability of the fund. A redemption of liability by a carrier including a self-insurer in which the fund is not a party for compensation paid for disability or death from silicosis or other dust disease or for disability or death arising out of and in the course of employment in the logging industry, made with the employee before the actual payment by the carrier including a self-insurer of $12,500.00 in compensation benefits for personal injury dates before July 1, 1985, or before the actual payment by the carrier of $25,000.00 or 104 weeks of benefits, whichever is greater, for personal injury dates after June 30, 1985, shall eliminate the liability of the silicosis, dust disease, and logging industry compensation fund.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As soon as practicable after January 1 of each year, the director shall assess pursuant to subsection (3) a sum that in total is equal to 175% of the total disbursements made from the second injury fund during the preceding calendar year, less the amount of net assets in excess of $200,000.00 in that fund as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The portion of the total assessment amounts under subsections (1) and (2) allocated to self-insurers shall be equal to a percentage determined as follows: The total paid losses of all self-insurers for the preceding calendar year divided by the total paid losses of all carriers during the preceding calendar year. The portion of the total assessment amounts under subsections (1) and (2) allocated to insurers shall be equal to a percentage determined as follows: The total paid losses of all insurers for the preceding calendar year divided by the total paid losses of all carriers during the preceding calendar year. The portion of the total assessments allocated to self-insurers that shall be collected from each self-insurer shall be equal to a percentage determined as follows: The total paid losses of that self-insurer divided by the total paid losses of all self-insurers during the preceding calendar year. The portion of the total assessment allocated to insurers that shall be collected from each insurer shall be equal to a percentage determined as follows: The amount of total direct premiums written as reported by that insurer divided by the amount of total direct premiums written as reported by all insurers during the preceding calendar year. As used in this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Direct premiums written" means standard written Michigan workers' compensation premium prior to the application of deductible credits, as reported to the designated advisory organization, through policy declarations and unit statistical reports compiled pursuant to the authority in section 2407 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.2407. For the purposes of determining assessments under this section, the reported data for the most recent full calendar year on file with the designated advisory organization shall be used.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Total paid losses" means total compensation benefits paid under this act, exclusive of payments made pursuant to sections 315, 319, and 345.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The director, upon the advice of the trustee representing the self-insurers, may make additional assessments upon private self-insurers as the trustee considers necessary to keep the self-insurers' security fund solvent. After December 31, 2019, the director shall not assess private employer group self-insurers on behalf of the self-insurers' security fund. The assessment for the 2015 calendar year and each calendar year thereafter shall be calculated based exclusively on claims payments and administrative expense of the self-insurers' security fund for the immediately preceding calendar year and the estimate of future liability for the current calendar year as reported in the annual financial report required under subsection (10), and shall not exceed 3% in any calendar year exclusive of payments made pursuant to sections 315, 319, and 345. Effective January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2019, the assessment limit under this subsection is increased to a percentage not to exceed 3.5%, if the proceeds of any assessment above 3% are used exclusively for claims against the self-insurers' security fund by disabled employees or dependents, as described in section 331, of Delphi corporation or Delphi automotive systems corporation that arise out of employment during the period from May 28, 1999 to October 7, 2009. However, any temporary increase that raises the assessment above 3.0% shall not be assessed unless all of the following requirements are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An appropriation of $15,000,000.00 or more is made and placed in a restricted account for the sole purpose of paying claims described in this subsection, which appropriation does not lapse at the end of a fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An actuarial analysis has confirmed that the sources of funding described in subdivision (c) will be insufficient to pay the expected claims.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The claims the self-insurers' security fund receives that may be paid from the temporary additional assessment exceed the amount that will be raised from the current assessment plus $8,000,000.00 of the appropriation under subdivision (a).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Claims are first paid from the 2 sources identified in subdivision (c) before amounts attributed to the temporary assessment increase or money from the appropriation above the $8,000,000.00 identified in subdivision (c) are used to pay claims.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) After subtracting the $8,000,000.00 from the appropriation for use as provided in subdivision (d), an amount equal to 20% of the balance of the appropriation under subdivision (a) is the maximum that may be expended from the remainder of the appropriation in any fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Notice of the assessments shall be sent by the director by first-class mail to each carrier. The notice shall state that the assessment must be received by the agency at the address indicated in the notice by 90 days after the notice mailing date and that interest and penalties will accrue at the following rates:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Subject to subdivision (c), for an assessment that is unpaid 90 days after the notice mailing date, interest accrues on the unpaid balance beginning the ninety-first day and is calculated in the same manner as interest on a money judgment in a civil action under section 6013(8) of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.6013.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Subject to subdivision (c), in addition to the interest under subdivision (a), a penalty of 1% per month for each month an assessment is unpaid beginning 181 days after the notice mailing date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If a carrier's delinquent assessments and any applicable interest and penalties total $25.00 or less for all funds in a single assessment year, the director may waive the assessments, interest, and penalties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) All assessments constitute elements of loss for the purpose of establishing rates for worker's compensation insurance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An employer who has stopped being a self-insurer shall continue to be liable for a second injury fund; silicosis, dust disease, and logging industry compensation fund; or self-insurers' security fund assessment on account of any compensation benefits, exclusive of payments made pursuant to sections 315, 319, and 345, paid by the employer during the previous calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The director shall certify to the trustees the collection and receipt of all money from assessments, including interest and penalties, noting any delinquencies. The trustees shall immediately notify delinquent carriers, including private self-insurers, of their delinquency in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested. The trustees shall take action as in their judgment is proper to effect collection of any delinquent assessment. All money received from assessments, including interest and penalties, under this section shall be turned over to the state treasurer who shall be the custodian of the self-insurers' security fund; the private employer group self-insurers security fund; the second injury fund; and the silicosis, dust disease, and logging industry compensation fund. The treasurer may make those investments as in the treasurer's judgment are in the best interest of the funds. The earnings from the investment of the money from the funds shall be credited to the funds. The state treasurer, at the end of each fiscal year, shall determine the amount that represents a pro rata earnings share due to each fund, shall credit the pro rata earning share to each fund, and shall notify the trustee of the amount credited and the balance of the respective fund as of September 30. The trustees shall make separate annual reports and accountings for each fund, which reports shall be included in the annual report of the agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If, after an annual review, the trustee representing the self-insurers determines that the remaining balance, exclusive of funds derived from an appropriation from the general fund, exceeds the amount necessary to pay the known claims, the trustee representing the self-insurers shall recommend to the director that the surplus derived from the temporary assessment increase under subsection (4) be returned, pro rata, to the self-insurers that paid the assessment increase.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Not later than March 31, 2015 and each year thereafter, the director shall make available to the public and include in the agency's annual report an annual financial report of the accounts and records of the self-insurers' security fund covering the immediately preceding calendar year. The annual financial report shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and shall contain certificates of examination by an independent auditor based on generally accepted accounting principles and generally accepted auditing standards, and supported by actuarial review and opinion of the future contingent liabilities. The director may require a special audit to be made at other times if the financial stability of the fund or the adequacy of its monetary reserves is in question. An audited financial statement included in the annual financial report shall include, but is not limited to, all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A detailed statement of assets, liabilities, and net assets.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A detailed statement of revenues and expenses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A detailed statement of cash flow.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Any related information relevant to the financial accounting and operations of the self-insurers' security fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) An estimate of future liability of the self-insurers' security fund for payment of claims made against a private self-insurer based on computations that reflect the probable total future cost of compensation and medical benefits due, or that can reasonably be expected to be due, over the life of the claim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A report of each liability assumed for payment of claims made against a private self-insurer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Not later than March 31, 2015 and each year thereafter, the director shall make available to the public and include in the agency's annual report a report detailing information regarding the self-insurers' security fund's management of claims. The report shall include, but is not limited to, all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Total cost per claim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Cost per active claim and cost per closed claim.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Average loss adjustment expense. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Methods utilized to increase efficiency and provide quality control in claims management.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If, before the end of any calendar year, the annual assessments, after having been substantially collected, have not provided funds sufficient to either the second injury fund or the silicosis, dust disease, and logging industry compensation fund to meet the known obligations of those funds as they mature before the next available assessment date, the trustees, if the trustees find it to be reasonably required, may borrow on behalf of 1 fund from the other fund a sum or sums as may be required.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Any sum or sums borrowed on behalf of 1 fund from the other fund shall be included in the next assessment of the borrowing fund and shall be repaid after the assessment has been substantially collected and the fund from which the sum or sums were borrowed during the period before repayment shall record the sum or sums as an asset.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The trustees shall not borrow in the manner described in this section if it would impair the ability of either fund to meet its known obligations as the obligations mature before the next available assessment date.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the trustees find that it is reasonably required that they borrow on behalf of 1 fund from the other, but that the borrowing will impair the ability of the fund to meet the fund's known obligations as the obligations mature before the next assessment date, then, and in that event only, the trustees may order the director to levy a special assessment on each carrier in a sum sufficient to permit the fund making the assessment to meet the fund's known obligations as the obligations mature before the next available assessment date. The assessment shall be levied on each carrier in the same proportion as used in the preceding annual assessment. Payment of the special assessment shall be paid by each carrier within 45 days after the date of the mailing of the notice of special assessment.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Each employer under this act, subject to the approval of the director, shall secure the payment of compensation under this act by either of the following methods:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) By receiving authorization from the director to be a self-insurer. In the case of an individual employer, the director may grant that authorization upon a reasonable showing by the employer of the employer's solvency and financial ability to pay the compensation and benefits provided for in this act and to make payments directly to the employer's employees as the employees become entitled to receive the payment under the terms and conditions of this act and pursuant to R 408.43c of the Michigan administrative code. If the director determines it to be necessary, the director shall require the furnishing of a bond or other security in a reasonable form and amount. Such security as may be required by the director may be provided by furnishing specific excess insurance, aggregate excess insurance coverage through a carrier authorized to write in this state in an amount acceptable to the director, a surety bond, an irrevocable letter of credit in a format acceptable to the agency, and claims payment guarantees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) By insuring against liability with an insurer authorized to transact the business of worker's compensation insurance within this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Under procedures and conditions specifically determined by the director, 2 or more employers in the same industry with combined assets of $1,000,000.00 or more, or 2 or more public employers of the same type of unit, may be permitted by the director to enter into agreements to pool their liabilities under this act for the purpose of qualifying as self-insurers. Each of the employer members participating in a self-insurer group possesses ownership in its proportional share of the assets of the group in excess of the self-insurer group obligations. The trustees of a self-insurer group, acting in their fiduciary capacity, shall establish processes and procedures for the distribution of excess assets with the approval of the director. For purposes of this subsection, cities, townships, counties, and villages; or 1 or more of the agencies, instrumentalities, or other legal entities of cities, townships, counties, or villages or any combination thereof; or authorities of 1 or more of cities, townships, counties, or villages or any combination thereof created pursuant to law are considered public employers of the same type of unit. An employer member of the approved group is classified as a self-insurer. For purposes of this subsection, universities and colleges, community colleges, and local and intermediate school districts, are considered public employers of the same type of unit. The director may grant authorization to become a member of an approved group upon a reasonable showing by an employer of the employer's solvency and financial stability to meet the employer's obligations as a member of the group. If the director determines it to be necessary, the director may require the furnishing of a surety bond, fidelity bond, or other security by the group in a reasonable form and amount. The security the director requires may be provided by furnishing specific excess insurance, aggregate excess insurance coverage through a carrier authorized to write in this state in an amount acceptable to the director. An irrevocable letter of credit or a surety bond may be furnished in place of aggregate excess insurance. The format of the irrevocable letter of credit used by the agency on December 15, 1992 is acceptable until the format of the irrevocable letter of credit is promulgated by agency rules. If an irrevocable letter of credit is proposed, the director may require an independent actuarial opinion from the group fund supporting the proposal and estimating the ultimate loss at 90% confidence level. Assets of the fund allocated for the payment of administrative expenses or set aside for claims payments shall not be used as collateral for the irrevocable letter of credit. Use of surplus assets as collateral must have prior agency approval. If the director determines it to be necessary, the director may obtain an independent review of the actuarial opinion submitted by the group fund at the expense of the group fund to determine the ability of the group fund to meet its obligation under this act. The group fund shall make available all documentation used for the actuarial report if requested by the director for an independent review. An employer, except a public employer, permitted to become a member of a self-insurers' group under this act shall execute a written agreement in which the employer agrees to jointly and severally assume and discharge, by payment, any lawful award entered by the agency against a member of the group. If the case is appealed by either party, the award must be upheld before a member of the group is liable. Any lawful award entered by the agency, and upheld if appealed, against a public employer that is a member of a group is a liability of the group jointly but not severally. If the group is unable to pay the award, the group or the agency shall individually assess those public employers who were members on the date of injury to the extent necessary to pay the award. An assessment is a contractual obligation of the public employer. As used in this subsection, "public employer" means a city, village, township, county, school district, or community college; or an agency, entity, or instrumentality thereof; or an authority comprising any combination of the foregoing. This subsection does not alter the obligation of either a group or an employer to comply with section 862. For purposes of this subsection, an authorized group self-insurer, in conjunction with providing security for the payment of compensation and benefits provided for in this act, may provide coverage customarily known as employer's liability insurance for members of the group.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For the purpose of determining whether employers are in the same industry under subsection (2), the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The forest industry includes those businesses engaged in the growing, harvesting, processing, or sale of forest products, except at the retail level, unless more than 80% of the income from the retailer comes from the growing, harvesting, processing, or wholesale sale of forest products, and any supplier or service companies that receive more than 80% of their income from these businesses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Forest products" include Christmas trees, firewood, maple syrup, and all other products derived from wood or wood fiber that are manufactured with woodworking equipment including saws, planers, drills, chippers, lumber dry kilns, sanders, glue presses, nailers, notchers, shapers, lathes, molders, and other similar finishing processes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The director may permit a nonpublic health care facility employer to become a member of a self-insurers' group with public employers under subsection (2) if the principal service rendered by the nonpublic health care facility employer is the same type of service rendered by the public employers. If a nonpublic health care facility employer is permitted to become a member of the same self-insurers' group with public employers, any lawful award entered by the agency against that nonpublic health care facility employer, if the award is upheld on appeal, is a liability of the group and, if the group is unable to pay the award, the group or the agency shall individually assess those nonpublic health care facility employers who were members on the date of injury to the extent necessary to pay the award. The director may waive the requirement of the written agreement required of a nonpublic health care facility employer under subsection (2) as to any member of a group involving a combination of public and nonpublic health care facility employers. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, subsection (2) is applicable to all self-insurers' groups and their individual employer members.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The director may decline to approve an application for individual or group self-insurance or terminate the self-insured privilege if the self-insurer fails to demonstrate that the self-insurer will be able to meet all present and future obligations under this act or the self-insurer fails to maintain security requirements previously imposed as a condition for approval. Notice of intent to deny or terminate self-insured status shall be mailed to the self-insurer. The notice must include the grounds for denial or termination. The self-insurer may request a hearing before the director within 15 days after the mailing of the notice by the agency. If the recommendation for termination of self-insured status is based on the self-insurer's failure to maintain existing security requirements such as excess insurance, letters of credit, guarantees, or surety bonds, the self-insurer shall reinstate the security requirements pending the hearing. Proof of the reinstatement shall accompany the request for hearing. If the self-insurer fails to reinstate existing security requirements, the director may make a final decision on the evidence before him or her without further hearing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If an appeal is taken from a decision of the director made under subsection (5), the director may require the self-insurer to post a surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or other security in a reasonable amount to guarantee that money will be available to pay worker's disability compensation benefits to injured employees covered by the self-insured program. The security must be filed with the director at the time an appeal is taken to the appellate commission and must be consistent with R 408.43a and R 408.43q of the Michigan administrative code. If the self-insurer is a group fund, the director shall review the assets and liabilities, claims experience history, and future claims potential of the group fund and recognize the ability of the group fund to assess its membership in making a decision on the need for additional security. A claim for review of the director's order or decision made pursuant to subsection (5) shall be filed with the Michigan compensation appellate commission within 15 days after the mailing date of the order or decision. If a claim for review is not filed within 15 days, the aggrieved party is considered to have waived the right to appeal. Within 15 days after service of a copy of the claim for review, unless the time is extended by order of the appellate commission, the agency shall file the original or certified copy of the entire record of the proceedings, unless parties to the proceedings for review stipulate that the record be shortened. A party who unreasonably refuses to so stipulate may be taxed by the appellate commission for the additional costs of preparation. If the self-insurer disputes the imposition of additional security at time of appeal, the dispute must be in the form of a motion directed to the appellate commission within 15 days after the filing of the record. The agency's reply to the motion shall be filed within 15 days after receipt of appellant's motion. The appellate commission shall act on the motion within 15 days after the agency files its reply to appellant's motion and shall notify the parties of interest of its decision. The appealing party's brief shall be filed with the appellate commission 15 days after the filing of the record and a copy shall be served upon the opposite party. The agency's reply brief shall be filed within 15 days after receipt of the appellant's brief. Oral argument may be requested by any party to the proceedings. The request must be in the form of a motion directed to the appellate commission within 15 days after the filing of the record. The appellate commission shall act on the motion within 15 days of filing the motion and shall notify the parties in interest of its decision. Otherwise, after 15 days, the appellate commission shall hear the case upon the record and shall consider the briefs that have been filed. The decision of the appellate commission shall be made within 30 days after the date of the oral argument or, if no oral argument, within 30 days after the date that the agency's brief is required to be filed. The appellate commission may remand the matter to the agency for purposes of supplying a complete record if it determines that the record is insufficient for purposes of review. Proceedings under this section do not operate as a stay of the agency's order, including any additional security imposed by the director, unless stayed by order of the appellate commission. The commission-ordered stay is subject to any conditions that the appellate commission imposes. The appellate commission has jurisdiction to affirm, modify, or set aside the order or decision of the director. A final order the appellate commission enters relating to a decision or order of the director to deny an application for self-insurance or to terminate the self-insured privilege under subsection (5) may be appealed by filing an application for leave to appeal to the court of appeals within 30 days after the order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The director may review and alter a decision approving the election of an employer to adopt any 1 of the methods permitted by subsection (1), (2), or (4) if, in the director's judgment, that action is necessary or desirable for any reason.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Under procedures and conditions specifically determined by the director, an individual, partnership, or corporation desiring to engage in the business of servicing an approved worker's compensation self-insurance program for an individual or group of employers shall apply to the director before entering into a contract with the individual or group of employers and shall satisfy the director that the individual, partnership, or corporation has adequate facilities and competent personnel to service a self-insurance program in a manner that will fulfill the employer's obligations under this act.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Under procedures and conditions specifically determined by the director, a separate insurance policy may be issued to cover employers performing work at a specified construction site if the director finds that the liability under this act of each employer to all his or her employees would at all times be fully secured and the cost of construction at the site, not including the cost of land acquisition, will exceed $65,000,000.00, and the contemplated completion period for the construction will be 5 years or less.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Rehabilitation services.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   That it will furnish or cause to be furnished such rehabilitation services for which the insured employer may become liable to furnish or cause to be furnished under the provisions of the Michigan worker's disability compensation act for all compensable injuries or compensable occupational diseases happening to his or her employees during the life of this contract or policy;</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Scope of contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   That this insurance contract or policy shall for all purposes be held and deemed to cover all the businesses the said employer is engaged in at the time of the issuance of this contract or policy and all other businesses, if any, the employer may engage in during the life of this contract or policy, and all employees the employer may employ in any of his or her businesses during the period covered by this policy;</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 827.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Where the injury for which compensation is payable under this act was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than a natural person in the same employ or the employer to pay damages in respect thereof, the acceptance of compensation benefits or the taking of proceedings to enforce compensation payments shall not act as an election of remedies but the injured employee or his or her dependents or personal representative may also proceed to enforce the liability of the third party for damages in accordance with this section. If the injured employee or his or her dependents or personal representative does not commence the action within 1 year after the occurrence of the personal injury, then the employer or carrier, within the period of time for the commencement of actions prescribed by statute, may enforce the liability of such other person in the name of that person. Not less than 30 days before the commencement of action by any party under this section, the parties shall notify, by certified mail at their last known address, the bureau, the injured employee, or in the event of the employee's death, his or her known dependents or personal representative or known next of kin, his or her employer, and the carrier. Any party in interest shall have a right to join in the action.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Prior to the entry of judgment, either the employer or carrier or the employee or the employee's personal representative may settle their claims as their interest shall appear and may execute releases therefor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Settlement and release by the employee is not a bar to action by the employer or carrier to proceed against the third party for any interest or claim it might have.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the injured employee or his or her dependents or personal representative settle their claim for injury or death or commence proceedings thereon against the third party before the payment of worker's compensation, such recovery or commencement of proceedings shall not act as an election of remedies and any moneys so recovered shall be applied as herein provided.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   In an action to enforce the liability of a third party, the plaintiff may recover any amount which the employee or his or her dependents or personal representative would be entitled to recover in an action in tort. Any recovery against the third party for damages resulting from personal injuries or death only, after deducting expenses of recovery, shall first reimburse the employer or carrier for any amounts paid or payable under this act to date of recovery and the balance shall immediately be paid to the employee or his or her dependents or personal representative and shall be treated as an advance payment by the employer on account of any future payments of compensation benefits.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Expenses of recovery shall be the reasonable expenditures, including attorney fees, incurred in effecting recovery. Attorney fees, unless otherwise agreed upon, shall be divided among the attorneys for the plaintiff as directed by the court. Expenses of recovery shall be apportioned by the court between the parties as their interests appear at the time of the recovery.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Compensation benefits referred to in this section shall in each instance include but not be limited to all expenses incurred under sections 315 and 345.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The furnishing of, or failure to furnish, safety inspections or safety advisory services incident to providing worker's compensation insurance, or pursuant to a contract providing for safety inspections or safety advisory services between the employer and a self-insurance service organization or a union shall not subject the insurer or self-insured service organization, or their agents or employees, or the union, its members or the members of its safety committee, to third party liability for damages for injury, death or loss resulting therefrom.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) After 6 months' time has elapsed from the date of a personal injury, any liability resulting from the personal injury may be redeemed by the payment of a lump sum by agreement of the parties, subject to the approval of a worker's compensation magistrate. If special circumstances are found which in the judgment of the worker's compensation magistrate require the payment of a lump sum, the worker's compensation magistrate may direct at any time in any case that the deferred payments due under this act be commuted on the present worth at 10% per annum to 1 or more lump sum payments and that the lump sum payments shall be made by the employer or carrier. When a proposed redemption agreement is filed, it may be treated as a lump sum application, within the discretion of a worker's compensation magistrate. The filing of a proposed redemption agreement or lump sum application shall not be considered an admission of liability and if the worker's compensation magistrate treats a proposed redemption agreement as a lump sum application under this section, the employer shall be entitled to a hearing on the question of liability.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The carrier shall notify the employer in writing, which may be electronically transmitted, of the proposed redemption agreement not less than 10 business days before a hearing on the proposed redemption agreement is held.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The time and place of the hearing on the proposed redemption agreement and the right of the employer to object to it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The worker's compensation magistrate may waive the requirements of subsection (2) if the carrier provides evidence that a good-faith effort has been made to provide the required notice or if the employer has consented in writing to the proposed redemption.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, for all proposed redemption agreements filed after December 31, 1983, each party to the agreement shall be liable for a fee of $100.00 to be used to defray costs incurred by the agency, the worker's compensation board of magistrates, and the worker's compensation appellate commission administering this act, except that in the case of multiple defendants the fee for the party defendant shall be $100.00 to be paid by the carrier covering the most recent date of injury. The agency shall develop a system to provide for the collection of the fee provided for by this subsection. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The fees collected pursuant to subsection (4) shall be placed in the worker's compensation administrative revolving fund under section 835a.

</P>
<P>Sec. 858.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The cost of a hearing, including the cost of taking stenographic notes of the testimony presented at the hearing, not exceeding the taxable costs allowed in actions at law in the circuit courts of this state, shall be fixed by the board of magistrates and paid by the state as other expenses of the state are paid. The payment of fees for all attorneys and physicians for services under this act shall be subject to the approval of a worker's compensation magistrate. In the event of disagreement as to such fees, an interested party may apply to the bureau for a hearing. After an order by the worker's compensation magistrate, review may be had by the director if a request is filed within 15 days. Thereafter the director's order may be reviewed by the appellate commission on request of an interested party, if a request is filed within 15 days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The director, by rule, may prescribe maximum attorney fees and the manner in which the amount may be determined or paid by the employee; but the maximum attorney fees prescribed by the director shall not be based upon a weekly benefit amount after coordination which is higher than 2/3 of the state average weekly wage at the time of the injury. For claims in which an application under section 847 is filed after March 31, 1986, the maximum attorney fee shall be based upon the coordinated worker's compensation benefit amount according to a contingency fee schedule, as provided for under rules promulgated pursuant to this act, but if this would result in a fee of less than $500.00, the claimant may agree to pay a sum, as specified in a written agreement between the claimant and the attorney prior to the filing of an application for hearing, so that the total fee received by the attorney would be not more than $500.00. When fees are requested in excess of that provided by rule, the director may award the fees by special order. In the computation of attorney fees for a case in which an application under section 847 is filed after March 31, 1986 and decided by the worker's compensation appellate commission, the fees shall be assessed on not more than 104 weeks of the period the matter was pending before the commission. This limitation on fees applies only to weekly compensation and does not apply to the period of time the matter was pending review before the court of appeals or supreme court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The director is authorized to promulgate rules calling for reductions in attorney fees in cases where applications for hearing have been dismissed, or where, in the discretion of the worker's compensation magistrate, such action is appropriate.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 925.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   When a vocationally disabled person receives a personal injury, the procedure and practice provided in this act applies to all proceedings under this chapter, except where specifically otherwise provided herein. Not less than 90 nor more than 150 days before the expiration of 52 weeks after the date of injury, the carrier shall notify the fund whether it is likely that compensation may be payable beyond a period of 52 weeks after the date of injury. The fund, thereafter, may review, at reasonable times, such information as the carrier has regarding the accident, and the nature and extent of the injury and disability.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the fund does not notify the carrier of its intent to dispute the payment of compensation, the carrier shall continue to make payments on behalf of the fund, and shall be reimbursed by the fund for all compensation paid and pertaining to the period beyond 52 weeks after the date of injury. However at any time subsequent to 52 weeks after the date of injury, the fund may notify the carrier of a dispute as to the payment of compensation. The liability of the fund to reimburse the carrier shall be suspended 30 days thereafter until such controversy is determined.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The obligation imposed by this section on a carrier to make payments on behalf of the fund does not impose an independent liability on the carrier. After a carrier has established the right to reimbursement, payment shall be made promptly on a proper showing every 6 months. If a carrier does not make the payments on behalf of the fund, the fund may make the payments directly to the persons entitled to such payments.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 931.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If an employee was employed under the provisions of this chapter and a dispute or controversy arises as to payment of compensation or the liability therefor, the employee shall give notice to, and make claim upon, the employer as provided in chapters 3 and 4 and apply for a hearing. On motion made in writing by the employer, the director, or the worker's compensation magistrate to whom the case is assigned, shall join the fund as a party defendant.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The bureau within 5 days of the entry of an order joining the fund as a party defendant shall give the fund written notice thereof by first-class mail which notice shall be mailed not less than 30 days before the date of hearing and shall include the name of the employee and employer and the date of the alleged personal injury or disability.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The fund, named as a defendant pursuant to motion, shall have 10 days after the date of mailing of notice of joinder to file objection to being named a party defendant. On the date of the hearing at which the liability of the parties is determined, the worker's compensation magistrate first shall hear arguments and take evidence concerning the joinder as party defendant. If the fund has filed a timely objection, and if the argument and evidence warrant, the worker's compensation magistrate shall grant a motion to dismiss.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   At the time of the hearing, the employer and the fund may appear, cross-examine witnesses, give evidence, and defend both on the issue of liability of the employer to the employee and on the issue of the liability of the fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The worker's compensation magistrate shall enter an order determining the respective liability of the employer and the fund.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 935.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   After an employer has paid an employee those benefits which have accrued during the period of 52 weeks after the date of injury, the trustees may compromise the liability of the fund by entering into a redemption of liability directly with the employee if in the judgment of the trustees it is in the employee's best interest to do so. Redemption of liability terminates all liability, including vocational rehabilitation, of the fund. A redemption of liability by the employer made with the employee before actual payment by the employer of those benefits which have accrued during the period of 52 weeks after the date of injury eliminates all liability, including vocational rehabilitation, of the fund.</DIV>
