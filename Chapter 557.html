Knowledge of the existence of the marital relationship shall not impose any duty to make inquiry as to the occurrence of such a breach, nor shall any such duty be imposed by knowledge of self-dealing by either spouse.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, any other person may rely, and shall be fully protected in so doing, upon the right of either spouse to receive, manage, control, dispose of, or otherwise deal with property which shall stand in the names of both of them in such manner that by law, but for the provisions of this act, either would be entitled so to deal therewith.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Whenever the husband or the wife is non compos mentis, or has been convicted of a felony and imprisoned for a period of more than 1 year, or whenever the husband or the wife has deserted the other spouse, or whenever the husband or the wife is an habitual drunkard, or for any other reason is incapacitated or incompetent to receive, manage, control, dispose of, or otherwise deal with community property, the other spouse may present a petition, duly verified, to the circuit court of the county in which the petitioner resides or, if a non-resident of this state, of the county wherein any of the community property is located. The petition shall state the name of the defendant spouse, a summary of all community property, so far as known, and the facts which render the defendant spouse incapable or incompetent to receive, manage, control, dispose of, or otherwise deal with community property, and shall pray that the spouse filing the petition be substituted for the defendant spouse, as to the right to receive, manage, control, dispose of, and otherwise deal with all or any designated portion or portions of the community property, then owned and thereafter to be acquired, which would otherwise be under the management and control of the defendant spouse.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   In all such cases service of process shall be had as in equity proceedings: Provided, however, That where it is alleged that the other spouse is non compos mentis, his guardian shall represent him or a guardian ad litem shall be appointed having such powers as in other civil actions.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Upon the hearing of the petition, the court shall enter a decree either dismissing said petition or adjudging the spouse filing the same to have such power to receive, manage, control and dispose of, and deal with all or any designated portion or portions of community property, then owned and thereafter to be acquired, which would otherwise be under the management and control of the defendant spouse, and containing such other provisions, which as to the court may appear to be just, proper, equitable, and to the best interests of the community.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   In case of any change in conditions after the entry of a decree pursuant to this section, either spouse may, by petition duly verified setting forth such change in conditions, apply to the court having jurisdiction thereof for the entry of a decree modifying or rescinding such decree. In such case notice to the other spouse shall be given in such manner as the court may direct. Upon the hearing of such petition the court shall enter a decree either denying such petition or modifying or rescinding the decree, as to the court may appear to be just, proper, equitable, and to the best interests of the community.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   A certified copy of such decree shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds for the county where the decree was entered and for the county where any of the community property is then located and such recording shall constitute notice to all parties of the facts contained in such decree as to all property located in any such county.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Whenever a probate court under the provisions of Act No. 288 of the Public Acts of 1939, as amended, has jurisdiction with respect to a spouse who is mentally incompetent, an habitual drunkard, or otherwise incompetent, such court shall have jurisdiction concurrent with that herein provided for the circuit court with respect to proceedings under the provisions of this section.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 13.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Upon the death of the husband or the wife, 1/2 of the community property shall continue to belong to the surviving spouse and the other 1/2 shall pass in accordance with testamentary disposition by the deceased spouse, or, in the absence of testamentary disposition, then to the heirs at law and distributees of the deceased spouse in the manner provided by law, subject to the following provisions of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The executor of the will or the administrator of the estate of the deceased spouse shall administer all of the community property which stands in the name of the deceased spouse, including the interests therein of the surviving spouse and of the deceased spouse, as well as the separate property of the deceased spouse. Such executor or administrator shall have the same rights, powers, and duties with respect to the administration and disposition of such community property, real and personal, as with respect to the separate property of the deceased spouse. All of the provisions of Act No. 288 of the Public Acts of 1939, as amended, with respect to the administration and disposition of property, real and personal, included in estates, shall be applicable with respect to such community property as well as with respect to such separate property. The probate court having jurisdiction of the estate of the deceased spouse shall determine whether and to what extent property being so administered constitutes separate property of the deceased spouse or community property and shall also determine whether and to what extent property standing in the name of the surviving spouse, or standing in the names of both the surviving spouse and the deceased spouse in such manner that by law, but for the provisions of this act, the surviving spouse would succeed thereto by reason of survivorship, constitutes separate property of the survivor or community property. Such determination shall be made upon application of the executor or administrator, the surviving spouse, or any other interested person, after such notice to the surviving spouse and any other interested person as the court may direct, and, in addition thereto, in any case where creditors of the estate have not yet been determined, notice shall be given as provided for in Act No. 288 of the Public Acts of 1939, as amended. Upon the making of such determination, the court shall enter an order in accordance therewith, including such directions to the executor or administrator and to the surviving spouse as to the execution and delivery of any conveyances, transfers, waivers, or releases as shall be appropriate to carry out the terms thereof, so that all property which constitutes community property shall be subject to administration by the executor or administrator and that which constitutes separate property of the surviving spouse shall be free from such administration, and all of the provisions of Act No. 288 of the Public Acts of 1939, as amended, which are applicable with respect to community property standing in the name of the deceased spouse, as hereinbefore provided, shall likewise be applicable with respect to all community property so subjected to administration by such executor or administrator.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   In the order for and at the time of the determination of claims, such court shall also determine whether and to what extent claims and administration expenses are payable out of community property or out of separate property of the deceased spouse and those payable out of community property shall be charged equally against the half of the community property which belongs to the survivor and the half which passes in accordance with testamentary disposition of or to the heirs and distributees of the deceased spouse. No estate, inheritance, succession, or similar taxes payable by reason of the transfer upon the death of the deceased spouse of the interest of such spouse in community property shall be charged against the half of the community property which belongs to the surviving spouse.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   When all claims and administration expenses for which the community property is liable have been fully satisfied, or appropriate provision has been made for their satisfaction, the court shall enter an order directing the executor or administrator to execute and deliver such instruments as shall be appropriate to transfer and convey 1/2 of the remainder of the community property to the surviving spouse and thereafter the interest of the surviving spouse in such property shall be that of a tenant in common. The probate court shall have authority to conduct any further hearing and to make any further determination which shall be incidental or necessary to carrying out the provisions of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, any other person may rely, and shall be fully protected in so doing, upon the right of the surviving spouse to receive, manage, control, dispose of, or otherwise deal with property standing in the name of the surviving spouse, or standing in the names of both the surviving spouse and the deceased spouse in such manner that by law, but for the provisions of this act, the surviving spouse would succeed thereto by reason of survivorship.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 4.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upon death of a married person, 1/2 of the property to which this act applies is the property of the surviving spouse and is not subject to testamentary disposition by the decedent, or distribution under the laws of succession of this state. One-half of that property is the property of the decedent and is subject to testamentary disposition or distribution under the laws of succession of this state. With respect to property to which this act applies, the 1/2 of the property which is the property of the decendent is not subject to the surviving spouse's right to elect against the will and an estate of dower does not exist in the property of the decedent.</DIV>
