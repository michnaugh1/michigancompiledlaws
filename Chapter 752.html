Notice of hearing the action and a copy of all pleadings shall be served upon the person, who may appear in opposition. If the court finds that the demand is proper, that there is reasonable cause to believe that there may have been or is presently occurring a violation of this act, and that the information sought or document of object demanded is relevant to the investigation, the court shall order the person to comply with the demand, subject to modification the court may prescribe.
