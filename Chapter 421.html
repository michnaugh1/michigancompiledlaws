</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>421.2 Declaration of public policy; findings.</B><P>Sec. 2.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The legislature acting in the exercise of the police power of the state declares that the public policy of the state is as follows: Economic insecurity due to unemployment is a serious menace to the health, morals, and welfare of the people of this state. Involuntary unemployment is a subject of general interest and concern which requires action by the legislature to prevent its spread and to lighten its burden which so often falls with crushing force upon the unemployed worker and his or her family, to the detriment of the welfare of the people of this state. Social security requires protection against this hazard of our economic life. Employers should be encouraged to provide stable employment. The systematic accumulation of funds during periods of employment to provide benefits for periods of unemployment by the setting aside of unemployment reserves to be used for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own, thus maintaining purchasing power and limiting the serious social consequences of relief assistance, is for the public good, and the general welfare of the people of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The legislature finds that from time to time high levels of unemployment have resulted in the exhaustion of the funds in this state's account of the unemployment trust fund, has required advances or loans to the state from the federal account of the unemployment trust fund, and has caused the imposition of lawful penalty taxes and solvency taxes to repay those advances and the interest on those advances. The financing and payment of the outstanding principal amount heretofore or hereafter advanced or loaned to this state from the federal account of the unemployment trust fund and the interest on those loans, if any, the funding of unemployment compensation benefits, and the financing and funding of this state's account in the unemployment trust fund including, without limitation, the funding of sufficient fund balances in the unemployment trust fund, are an essential governmental function and public purpose of this state. The legislature further finds that the issuance of bonds by the Michigan finance authority or other issuer to finance the foregoing payments and to avoid or reduce the imposition of penalty taxes and solvency taxes will further and facilitate an essential governmental function and public purpose of this state that will encourage the development of industry and commerce, foster economic growth, provide employment opportunities for the citizens and residents of this state and further other economic development and activities in this state, and in general promote the public health and general welfare of the people of this state.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) For calendar years beginning January 1, 1994 and ending December 31, 1998, the unemployment agency shall develop and implement a program to provide, upon request, claimant and employer advocacy assistance or consultation. The purpose of the program is to provide information, consultation, and representation to claimants and employers relating to the referee or board of review appeal levels, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The program must be funded from the penalty and interest account in the contingent fund. If the program does not operate or the legislature fails to approve a yearly appropriation for the program in an amount at least equal to the maximum yearly expenditure for the program as provided in this subsection, then the provision of section 19(a)(5) reducing the maximum nonchargeable benefits component from 1% to 1/2 of 1% is not effective for a tax year for which the appropriation is not made or in which the program does not operate. For fiscal years beginning on and after October 1, 1994, the maximum amount of the expenditure for the program each year must not exceed $1,500,000.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The appropriations must be used to finance all costs connected with the program. Costs related to the representation of claimants must not exceed 60% of the maximum expenditure allowed in each fiscal year, and costs related to the representation of employers must not exceed 40% of the maximum expenditure allowed in each fiscal year. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Before an individual provides advocacy assistance services under this section, the individual must apply to the unemployment agency for approval. The unemployment agency shall develop standards for individuals providing advocacy assistance services including standards relating to knowledge of this act and the practices and procedures at the referee and board of review appeal levels. An individual who is not an attorney may provide advocacy assistance services. The unemployment agency shall develop a schedule for payment of individuals providing advocacy assistance services. Active unemployment agency or state employees shall not provide advocacy assistance services. The only active state or unemployment agency employees involved in the program shall be those supervising or coordinating the program. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The unemployment agency may include in the program standards regarding the provision of advocacy assistance services in precedent setting cases, multiclaimant cases, cases without merit, or regarding other cases or factors as determined by the unemployment agency. However, to the extent that funding is available from the appropriation under subsection (2), the unemployment agency shall not withhold advocacy assistance services in cases involving fraud under section 54. If the unemployment agency makes a final determination or final redetermination or an administrative law judge, the Michigan compensation appellate commission, or a court makes a final order that an employer or claimant who received advocacy assistant services committed fraud under section 54, the unemployment agency shall make an effort to recover from the employer or claimant, respectively, an amount equal to the representation fees associated with the advocacy assistance services provided to the employer or claimant, respectively.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Individuals who are approved by the unemployment agency to provide advocacy assistance services shall enter into a contract with the unemployment agency that states that the payments made pursuant to the schedule established by the unemployment agency are payment in full for all services rendered and expenses incurred and that the claimant or employer who has received the benefit of the services will not be billed for and is not liable for the cost of the services or representation provided. An individual approved by the unemployment agency to provide advocacy assistance services shall accept only the fee approved by the unemployment agency for the services and shall not accept any other fee for the services from the claimant or the employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a claimant or an employer receives advocacy assistance services beyond an initial consultation, the other party in the case must be immediately notified. The unemployment agency shall include in the program provisions to determine the method and the timeliness by which immediate notice must be provided. The unemployment agency shall not approve the same individual to provide advocacy assistance services for both claimants and employers. The unemployment agency shall clearly designate each individual approved to provide services under this section as representing either claimants or employers. An individual approved by the unemployment agency to provide advocacy assistance services is not entitled to payment under this section for representing the individual's own personal interests. An active state employee shall not represent a claimant or an employer under this program at the referee or board of review appeal levels. However, this subsection does not prohibit an employee of the unemployment agency from participating in a case in which the unemployment agency is an interested party or from representing the unemployment agency's interest when acting as an administrator for a federal program as required by federal law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The unemployment agency shall make an annual report to the legislature on the operation of the program. The first report under this subsection is due within 60 days after the first anniversary date of the beginning of the program. Each report under this subsection must include, but is not limited to, the following for the previous 12-month period:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Number and type of claimants served.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Number and type of employers served.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Costs to the program of the claimants served.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Costs to the program of the employers served.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) An analysis of the impact of the services provided on the appeal system provided by this act.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 8.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A basic purpose of this act is to lighten the burden of involuntary unemployment on the unemployed worker and his family. In view of this, the maximum weekly benefit rates under section 27(b) are related to the cost of the necessities of life for the various dependency classes recognized in that section. At the same time, the legislature has concluded that the maximum weekly benefit rates established in that section will finance the most favorable standard of living consistent with maintaining for unemployed individuals generally a proper incentive to seek and accept new work. To maintain this optimum relationship between maximum weekly benefit rates and the standard of living of the unemployed individual, the maximum weekly benefit rates established shall be reviewed annually. The commission shall annually, not later than February 28, compare the United States department of labor's consumers' price index for the preceding December with the corresponding United States department of labor's consumers' price index for the base month. The base month, as used in this subsection, means the month of June 1974, which shall remain the base month until the next adjustment of maximum weekly benefit rates is made. Thereafter, the base month shall be the month of December preceding the most recent calendar year in which an adjustment of maximum weekly benefit rates is made. If in a calendar year the United States department of labor's consumers' price index for the preceding December has increased or decreased as compared to the base month, the commission shall determine the percentage of that increase or decrease. The commission shall then multiply the maximum weekly benefit rate for each dependency class by this percentage. If the product thus obtained is $1.00, or more, the commission shall report that fact to the governor, the legislature, and the Michigan employment security advisory council.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The commission may by itself, or by its duly appointed agents, examine or copy the books, records and papers of any employing unit relating to any requirement pertaining to this act. Any member of the commission or its duly authorized agents may issue a subpoena requiring any person to appear before the commission, or its duly authorized agent at any reasonable time and place, and be examined with reference to any matter within the scope of the inquiry or investigation being conducted by the commission and to produce any books, records or papers pertaining to the question involved. Any member of the commission or its duly authorized agents may administer an oath or affirmation to a witness in any matter before the commission, certify to official acts, and take depositions. In case of disobedience of a subpoena, the commission, or the party on whose behalf it was issued, may invoke the aid of any circuit court of the state in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, records and papers pertaining to the question involved. And any of the circuit courts of the state within the jurisdiction of which such inquiry is carried on may, in case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, issue an order requiring such person to appear before said commission or its duly authorized agents and to produce books, records and papers if so ordered and give evidence touching the matter in question; and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   No person shall be excused from testifying or from producing any books, records or papers in any investigation, or upon any hearing, when ordered to do so by the commission, or its duly authorized agents, upon the ground that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a criminal penalty; but no person shall be prosecuted or subjected to any criminal penalty for, or on account of, any transaction made or thing concerning which he is compelled, upon the claiming of his privilege to testify.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) There is created in the department of treasury a special fund to be known and designated as the administration fund (Michigan employment security act). Any balances in the administration fund at the end of any fiscal year of this state shall be carried over as a part of the administration fund and shall not revert to the general fund of this state. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3), all money deposited into the administration fund under this act shall be appropriated by the legislature to the unemployment agency to pay the expenses of the administration of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The administration fund shall be credited with all money appropriated to the fund by the legislature, all money received from the United States or any agency of the United States for that purpose, and all money received by this state for the fund. All money in the administration fund that is received from the federal government or any agency of the federal government or that is appropriated by this state for the purposes of this act, except money requisitioned from the account of this state in the unemployment trust fund pursuant to a specific appropriation made by the legislature in accordance with section 903(c)(2) of title IX of the social security act, 42 USC 1103(c)(2), and with section 17(3)(f), shall be expended solely for the purposes and in the amounts found necessary by the appropriate agency of the United States and the legislature for the proper and efficient administration of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) All money requisitioned from the account of this state in the unemployment trust fund pursuant to a specific appropriation made by the legislature in accordance with section 903(c)(2) of title IX of the social security act, 42 USC 1103(c)(2), and with section 17(3)(f), shall be deposited in the administration fund. Any money that remains unexpended at the close of the 2-year period beginning on the date of enactment of a specific appropriation shall be immediately redeposited with the secretary of the treasury of the United States to the credit of this state's account in the unemployment trust fund; or any money that for any reason cannot be expended or is not to be expended for the purpose for which appropriated before the close of this 2-year period shall be redeposited at the earliest practicable date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If any money received after June 30, 1941, from the appropriate agency of the United States under title III of the social security act, 42 USC 501 to 504, or any unencumbered balances in the administration fund (Michigan employment security act) as of that date, or any money granted after that date to this state under the Wagner-Peyser act, as defined in section 12, or any money made available by this state or its political subdivisions and matched by money granted to this state under the Wagner-Peyser act, is found by the appropriate agency of the United States, because of any action or contingency, to have been lost or been expended for purposes other than, or in amounts in excess of, those found necessary by that agency of the United States for the proper administration of this act, the money shall be replaced by money appropriated for that purpose from the general funds of this state to the administration fund (Michigan employment security act) for expenditure as provided in this act. Upon receipt of notice of such a finding by the appropriate agency of the United States, the unemployment agency shall promptly report the amount required for replacement to the governor and the governor shall, at the earliest opportunity, submit to the legislature a request for the appropriation of that amount. This subsection does not relieve this state of its obligation with respect to funds received prior to July 1, 1941, under the provisions of 42 USC 501 to 504.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If any funds expended or disbursed by the unemployment agency are found by the appropriate agency of the United States to have been lost or expended for purposes other than, or in amounts in excess of, those found necessary by that agency of the United States for the proper administration of this act, and if these funds are replaced as provided in subsection (4) by money appropriated for that purpose from the general fund of this state, then the director who approved the expenditure or disbursement of those funds for those purposes or in those amounts, is liable to this state in an amount equal to the sum of money appropriated to replace those funds. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) There is created in the department of treasury a separate fund to be known as the contingent fund (Michigan employment security act) into which shall be deposited all solvency taxes collected under section 19a and all interest on contributions, penalties, and damages collected under this act. Except as provided in subsection (7), all amounts in the contingent fund (Michigan employment security act) and all earnings on those amounts are continuously appropriated without regard to fiscal year for the administration of the talent investment agency, as established under Executive Reorganization Order No. 2014-6, MCL 125.1995, including, but not limited to, the development and execution of workforce training programs, and for the payment of interest on advances from the federal government to the unemployment compensation fund under 42 USC 1321, to be expended only if authorized by the unemployment agency. Money deposited from the solvency taxes collected under section 19a shall not be used for the administration of the unemployment agency, except for the repayment of loans from the state treasury and interest on loans made under section 19a(3). However, an authorization or expenditure shall not be made as a substitution for a grant of federal funds or for any portion of a grant that, in the absence of an authorization, would be available to the unemployment agency. Immediately upon receipt of administrative grants from the appropriate agency of the United States to cover administrative costs for which the unemployment agency has authorized and made expenditures from the contingent fund, those grants shall be transferred to the contingent fund to the extent necessary to reimburse the contingent fund for the amount of those expenditures. Amounts needed to refund interest, damages, and penalties erroneously collected shall be withdrawn and expended for those purposes from the contingent fund upon order of the unemployment agency. Any amount authorized to be expended for administration under this section may be transferred to the administration fund. An amount not needed for the purpose for which authorized shall, upon order of the unemployment agency, be returned to the contingent fund. Amounts needed to refund erroneously collected solvency taxes shall be withdrawn and expended for that purpose upon order of the unemployment agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017 only, $10,000,000.00 of the money in the contingent fund created in subsection (6) is transferred to and shall be deposited into the general fund.</div>

The unemployment agency shall make reports, in a form and containing information as the appropriate agency of the United States may require, and shall comply with the provisions that the appropriate agency of the United States prescribes to assure the correctness and verification of the reports. The unemployment agency, subject to this act, shall comply with the regulations prescribed by the appropriate agency of the United States relating to the receipt or expenditure of the sums that are allotted and paid to this state for the purpose of assisting in the administration of this act.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b)(1) Information obtained from an employing unit or individual pursuant to the administration of this act and determinations as to the benefit rights of any individual are confidential and must not be disclosed or open to public inspection other than to public employees and public officials in the performance of their official duties under this act and to agents or contractors of those public officials, including those described in subparagraph (viii), in a manner that reveals the individual's or the employing unit's identity or any identifying particular about an individual or a past or present employing unit or that could foreseeably be combined with other publicly available information to reveal identifying particulars. However, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Information in the unemployment agency's possession that might affect a claim for worker's disability compensation under the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.101 to 418.941, must be available to interested parties as defined in R 421.201 of the Michigan Administrative Code, regardless of whether the unemployment agency is a party to an action or proceeding arising under that act.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Except as provided in this act, the information and determinations must not be used in any action or proceeding before any court or administrative tribunal unless the unemployment agency is a party to or a complainant in the action or proceeding, or unless used for the prosecution of fraud, civil proceeding, or other legal proceeding in the programs indicated in subdivision (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Any report or statement, written or verbal, made by any person to the unemployment agency, any member of the unemployment agency, or any person engaged in administering this act is a privileged communication; and a person, firm, or corporation is not liable for slander or libel on account of a report or statement.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) Information obtained in connection with the administration of this act may be made available to persons or agencies for purposes appropriate to the operation of a public employment service or unemployment compensation program. Subject to restrictions that it prescribes by rule, the unemployment agency may also make that information available to agencies of other states that are responsible for the administration of public assistance to unemployed workers; to the departments of this state; and to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in connection with a criminal investigation involving the health, safety, or welfare of the public. The information released must be used only for purposes not inconsistent with the purposes of this act. The information must only be released upon assurance by the entity receiving the information that it will reimburse the cost of providing the information and will not disclose the information except to the individual or employer that is the subject of the information, an attorney or agent of the individual or employer, or a prosecuting authority for or on behalf of the entity receiving the information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vii) Upon request, the unemployment agency shall furnish to any agency of the United States charged with the administration of public works or assistance through public employment, and may furnish to any state agency similarly charged, the name, address, ordinary occupation, and employment status of each recipient of benefits and the recipient's rights to further benefits under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(viii) Subject to restrictions it prescribes, by rule or otherwise, the unemployment agency may also make information that it obtains available for use in connection with research projects of a public service nature; for course, program, or training program planning, improvement, or evaluation; for grant application or evaluation; for institutional or program accreditation; for economic development or workforce research; for award eligibility; or for federal or state mandated reporting, to a public official, eligible educational institution, or Michigan works agency or to an agency of this state that is acting as a contractor or agent of a public official and conducting research that assists the public official in carrying out the duties of the office.

A person associated with those institutions or agencies or an agency of this state shall not disclose the information in a manner that would reveal the identity of an individual or employing unit from or concerning whom the information was obtained by the unemployment agency. The unemployment agency shall enter into a written, enforceable agreement with the public official for a period of not more than 10 years that holds the public official, eligible educational institution, or Michigan works agency responsible for ensuring that the confidentiality of the information is maintained. If the agreement is violated, the agreement must be terminated and the public official, eligible educational institution, or Michigan works agency may be subject to penalties equivalent to those that apply under section 54(f). The unemployment agency, at the request of an independent educational institution, shall perform data analysis of information that the unemployment agency has obtained and provide the results of the analysis to the independent educational institution. The unemployment agency may perform analysis for course, program, or training program planning, improvement, or evaluation; grant application or evaluation; institutional or program accreditation; economic development or workforce research; award eligibility; or federal or state mandated reporting. The unemployment agency shall not disclose information to an independent educational institution in a manner that would reveal the identity of an individual or employing unit from or concerning whom the information was obtained by the unemployment agency.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ix) The unemployment agency may request the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States to cause an examination of the correctness of any return or report of any national banking association rendered under this act, and may, in connection with the request, transmit the report or return to the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States as provided in section 3305(c) of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 3305(c).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The information must be disclosed only if the qualified requesting agency has executed an agreement with the unemployment agency to obtain the information and the information is requested for the purpose of determining the eligibility of applicants for benefits, or the type and amount of benefits for which applicants are eligible, under any of the programs listed above or under title II and XVI of the social security act, 42 USC 401 to 434 and 42 USC 1381 to 1383f; for establishing and collecting child support obligations from, and locating individuals owing such obligations that are being enforced under a plan described in section 454 of the social security act, 42 USC 654; or for investigating or prosecuting alleged fraud under any of these programs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The unemployment agency shall cooperate with this state's department of health and human services in establishing the computer data matching system authorized in section 83 of the social welfare act, 1939 PA 280, MCL 400.83, to transmit the information requested on at least a quarterly basis. The information must not be released unless the qualified requesting agency agrees to reimburse the unemployment agency for the costs incurred in furnishing the information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>In addition to the requirements of this section, except as later provided in this subdivision, all other requirements with respect to confidentiality of information obtained in the administration of this act apply to the use of the information by the officers and employees of the qualified requesting agencies, and the sanctions imposed under this act for improper disclosure of the information apply to those officers and employees.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The unemployment agency may enter into an agreement with any qualified requesting agency for the purposes described in this subdivision. The agreement or agreements must comply with all federal laws and regulations applicable to those agreements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The unemployment agency shall enable the United States Department of Health and Human Services to obtain prompt access to any wage and unemployment benefit claims information, including any information that may be useful in locating an absent parent or an absent parent's employer for purposes of section 453 of the social security act, 42 USC 653, or in carrying out the child support enforcement program under title IV of the social security act, 42 USC 601 to 679c. The unemployment agency shall not provide the requesting agency access to the information unless the requesting agency agrees to reimburse the unemployment agency for the costs incurred in furnishing the information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Upon request accompanied by presentation of a consent to the release of information signed by an individual, the unemployment agency shall disclose to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, any state or local public housing agency, or an entity contracting with a state or local public housing agency to provide public housing, or any other agency responsible for verifying an applicant's or participant's eligibility for, or level of benefits in, any housing assistance program administered by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, the name; address; wage information; whether an individual is receiving, has received, or has applied for unemployment benefits; and the amount of unemployment benefits the individual is receiving or is entitled to receive under this act. This information must be used only to determine an individual's eligibility for benefits or the amount of benefits to which an individual is entitled under a housing assistance program of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The unemployment agency shall not release the information unless the requesting agency agrees to reimburse the unemployment agency for the costs incurred in furnishing the information. For purposes of this subdivision, "public housing agency" means an agency described in section 3(b)(6) of the United States housing act of 1937, 42 USC 1437a(b)(6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The unemployment agency may make available to the department of treasury information collected for the income and eligibility verification system begun on October 1, 1988 for the purpose of detecting potential tax fraud in other areas. </div>

The recipient shall not redisclose the information to any other individual or entity without the written permission of the unemployment agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The unemployment agency may enter into agreements with the appropriate agencies of other states or the federal government under which potential rights to benefits accumulated under the unemployment compensation laws of other states or of the federal government, or both, may constitute the basis for the payment of benefits through a single appropriate agency under plans that the unemployment agency finds will be fair and reasonable to all affected interests and will not result in substantial loss to the unemployment compensation fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d)(1) The unemployment agency may enter into reciprocal agreements with the appropriate agencies of other states or of the federal government that adjust the collection and payment of contributions by employers with respect to employment not localized within this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The unemployment agency may enter into reciprocal agreements with agencies of other states administering unemployment compensation under which contributions paid by an employer to any other state may be received by the other state as an agent acting for and on behalf of this state to the same extent as if the contributions had been paid directly to this state if the payment is remitted to this state. Contributions so received by another state are considered contributions, required and paid under this act as of the date the contributions were received by the other state. The unemployment agency may collect contributions in a like manner for agencies of other states administering unemployment compensation and remit the contributions to the agencies under the terms of the reciprocal agreements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The unemployment agency may make this state's records relating to the administration of this act available and may furnish to the Railroad Retirement Board or any other state or federal agency administering an unemployment compensation law, at the expense of that board or agency, copies of the records as the Railroad Retirement Board considers necessary for its purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The unemployment agency may cooperate with or enter into agreements with any agency of another state or of the United States charged with the administration of any unemployment insurance or public employment service law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The unemployment agency may investigate, secure, and transmit information, make available services and facilities, and exercise other powers provided in this act with respect to the administration of this act as it considers necessary or appropriate to facilitate the administration of any unemployment compensation or public employment service law, and may accept and utilize information, services, and facilities made available to this state by the agency charged with the administration of any other unemployment compensation or public employment service law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>On request of an agency that administers an employment security law of another state or a foreign government and that has found, in accordance with that law, that a claimant is liable to repay benefits received under that law, the unemployment agency may collect the amount of the benefits from the claimant to be refunded to that agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>In a case in which under this subsection a claimant is liable to repay an amount to the agency of another state or a foreign government, the amount may be collected by civil action in the name of the unemployment agency acting as agent for that agency. Court costs must be paid or guaranteed by the agency of that state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>To the extent permissible under the laws and constitution of the United States, the unemployment agency may enter into or cooperate in arrangements under which facilities and services provided under this act and facilities and services provided under the unemployment compensation law of Canada may be utilized for the taking of claims and the payment of benefits under the unemployment compensation law of this state or under a similar law of Canada.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Any employer who is not a resident of this state and who exercises the privilege of having 1 or more individuals perform service for him or her within this state, and any resident employer who exercises that privilege and thereafter leaves this state, is considered to have appointed the secretary of state as his or her agent and attorney for the acceptance of process in any civil action under this act. In instituting an action, the unemployment agency shall cause process or notice to be filed with the secretary of state, and the service is sufficient and of the same force and validity as if served upon the nonresident or absent employer personally within this state. The unemployment agency shall immediately send a notice and copy of the service of process or notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the employer at his or her last known address. The return receipt, the unemployment agency's affidavit of compliance with this section, and a copy of the notice of service must be attached to the original of the process filed in the court in which the civil action is pending.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The courts of this state shall recognize and enforce liabilities, as provided in this act, for unemployment compensation contributions, penalties, and interest imposed by other states that extend a like comity to this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The attorney general may commence action in the appropriate court of any other state or any other jurisdiction of the United States by and in the name of the unemployment agency to collect unemployment compensation contributions, penalties, and interest finally determined, redetermined, or decided under this act to be legally due to this state. The officials of other states that extend a like comity to this state may sue in the courts of this state for the collection of unemployment compensation contributions, penalties, and interest, the liability for which has been similarly established under the laws of the other state or jurisdiction. A certificate by the secretary of another state under the great seal of that state attesting the authority of the official or officials to collect unemployment compensation contributions, penalties, and interest is conclusive evidence of that authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The attorney general may commence action in this state as agent for or on behalf of any other state to enforce judgments and established liabilities for unemployment compensation taxes or contributions, penalties, and interest due the other state if the other state extends a like comity to this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The unemployment agency may enter into reciprocal agreements with the appropriate and authorized agencies of other states or of the federal government under which remuneration and services that determine entitlement to benefits under the unemployment compensation law of another state or of the federal government are considered wages and employment for the purposes of sections 27 and 46, if the other state or federal agency has agreed to reimburse the fund for that portion of benefits paid under this act upon the basis of the remuneration and services as the unemployment agency finds will be fair and reasonable as to all affected interests. A reciprocal agreement may provide that wages and employment that determine entitlement to benefits under this act are considered wages or services on the basis of which unemployment compensation under the law of another state or of the federal government is payable; that services performed by an individual for a single employing unit for which services are customarily performed by the individual in more than 1 state are considered services performed entirely within any 1 of the states in which any part of the individual's service is performed, in which the individual has his or her residence, or in which the employing unit maintains a place of business, if there is in effect, as to those services, an election approved by the agency charged with the administration of the state's unemployment compensation law, under which all the services performed by the individual for the employing unit are considered to be performed entirely within this state; and that the unemployment agency will reimburse other state or federal agencies charged with the administration of unemployment compensation laws with the reasonable portion of benefits, paid under the law of any other state or of the federal government upon the basis of employment and wages, as the unemployment agency finds will be fair and reasonable as to all affected interests. Reimbursements payable under this subsection are considered benefits for the purpose of limiting duration of benefits and for the purposes of sections 20(a) and 26, and the payments are chargeable to the contributing employer's experience account for the purposes of sections 17, 18, 19, and 20, or the reimbursing employer's account under section 13c, 13g, 13i, or 13l, as applicable. Benefits paid under a combined wage plan must be allocated and charged to each employer involved in the quarter in which the paying state requires reimbursement. Benefits charged to this state must be allocated to each employer of this state who has employed the claimant during the base period of the paying state in the same ratio that the wages earned by the claimant during the base period of the paying state in the employ of the employer bears to the total amount of wages earned by the claimant in the base period of the paying state in the employ of all employers of the state. The unemployment agency may make to and receive from other state or federal agencies reimbursements from or to the fund, pursuant to arrangements made under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The unemployment agency may enter into any agreement necessary to cooperate with any agency of the United States charged with the administration of any program for the payment of primary or supplemental benefits to individuals recently discharged from the military services of the United States and to assist in the establishing of eligibility and in the payments of benefits under those programs. The unemployment agency may, for those purposes, accept and administer funds made available by the federal government and may accept and exercise any delegated function under those programs. The unemployment agency shall not enter into an agreement providing for, or exercise any function connected with, the disbursement of this state's unemployment trust fund for purposes not authorized by this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The unemployment agency may enter into agreements with the appropriate agency of the United States under which, in accordance with the laws of the United States, the unemployment agency, as agent of the United States or from funds provided by the United States, provides for the payment of unemployment compensation or unemployment allowances of any kind, including the payment of any benefits and allowances that are made available for manpower development, training, retraining, readjustment, and relocation. The unemployment agency may receive and disburse funds from the United States or any appropriate agency of the United States pursuant to those agreements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>If the federal enactment providing for unemployment compensation, training allowance, or relocation payments requires joint federal-state financing of those payments, the unemployment agency may participate in the programs by using funds appropriated by the legislature to the extent provided by the legislature for those programs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) The unemployment agency shall participate in any arrangement that provides for the payment of compensation on the basis of combining an individual's wages and employment covered under this act with his or her wages and employment covered under the unemployment compensation laws of other states, if the arrangement is approved by the United States Secretary of Labor in consultation with the state unemployment compensation agencies as reasonably calculated to assure the prompt and full payment of compensation. An arrangement must include provisions for both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Applying the base period of a single state law to a claim involving the combining of an individual's wages and employment covered under 2 or more state unemployment compensation laws.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Avoiding the duplicate use of wages and employment as a result of the combining.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) The attorney general of this state or attorneys designated by the attorney general shall represent the unemployment agency and this state in a proceeding before any court. Only the attorney general or other attorneys designated by the attorney general shall act as legal counsel for the unemployment agency.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>421.13 Contributions of employer; rate; obligation assessment payment; computation and payment; reports; quarterly wage report; apportioned payments; optional payment method; "eligible contributing employer" defined.</B><P>Sec. 13.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Each employer subject to this act shall pay to the unemployment agency a tax in the form of payments in lieu of contributions if the employer is liable for those payments, or shall pay tax contributions equal to a standard rate of 5.4%, subject to an adjustment in rate of contributions as provided for in section 19. The contributions become due and must be paid to the unemployment agency, for the unemployment compensation fund, by each employer semiannually or for shorter periods of not less than 28 days, as the unemployment agency may by rule prescribe. Contributions due and payable from an employer that is liable under this act solely on the basis of the payment of wages for domestic service may be paid annually on the date specified by the unemployment agency. An obligation assessment payment made pursuant to section 10a or a contribution payment made pursuant to this section must be credited first to interest on the obligation assessment and then to the obligation assessment, with those payments applied to amounts unpaid and owing in the oldest calendar quarter and progressing each quarter to the most recent quarter. Any remainder must be credited first to penalties on contributions, then to interest on contributions, and then to contribution principal, with those payments applied to amounts unpaid and owing in the oldest calendar quarter and progressing each quarter to the most recent quarter. An employer's contribution must not be deducted directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from wages of individuals in his or her employ. A contribution payment amount that is not an even dollar amount must be credited to the account of the employer in an amount equal to the next lower dollar amount if under 50 cents and in an amount equal to the next higher dollar amount if 50 cents or more. The unemployment agency may prescribe by rule the details of the computation and payment of contributions. Every employing unit shall file with the unemployment agency periodic reports on forms and at a time the unemployment agency prescribes to disclose liability for contributions under this act. Each employing unit shall keep records, including wage and employment records, and shall, within prescribed time limits, submit or provide reports, including wage and employment reports, to the unemployment agency or to the employing unit's employees or former employees as the unemployment agency prescribes by rule.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Beginning with the first quarter of 1986, each employer shall file a quarterly wage report with the unemployment agency, on forms and at a time as the unemployment agency prescribes, which shall include for each of the employer's employees the employee's name, Social Security number, gross wages paid during each quarter, and the name, address, and federal and state employer identification number of the individual's employer. If the unemployment agency discovers an error in a report filed timely, the unemployment agency shall provide written notification to the employer of the error. If the employer provides corrected information within 14 days of the notification, the administrative fine provided in section 54 for a late, incomplete, or erroneous report does not apply. An employer that has more than 25 employees on January 1, 2013 shall file quarterly reports beginning with the report for the first quarter of 2013 by an electronic method approved by the unemployment agency. An employer that has more than 5 but fewer than 26 employees on January 1, 2013 shall file quarterly reports beginning with the report for the first quarter of 2014 by an electronic method approved by the unemployment agency. An employer that has 5 or fewer employees on January 1, 2013 shall file quarterly reports beginning with the report for the first quarter of 2015 by an electronic method approved by the unemployment agency, except that the director of the unemployment agency, upon application by the employer, may grant additional time for the employer to comply with the electronic filing method if the director concludes that satisfying the requirement of electronic filing will cause economic hardship for the employer. The employer shall provide, and the director shall consider, information about the employer's anticipated cost expenditure for preparing for electronic filing and about the employer's annual income. An employer that complies with the reporting requirements of this subsection by filing electronically a quarterly wage report using a method approved by the unemployment agency is not required to file periodically to disclose contributions under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If in the first quarter of a year an eligible contributing employer incurs a contribution obligation that is equal to 50% or more of the eligible contributing employer's total contribution obligation for the immediately preceding year, the eligible contributing employer may discharge the liability for that first-quarter contribution obligation by making quarterly payments that distribute the first-quarter contribution obligation equally over the first quarter and the immediately succeeding 3 quarters. To avoid interest and penalties otherwise applicable to the payments described in this subsection, an employer that meets the requirements of this subsection shall notify the unemployment agency of its election to make apportioned payments with the first quarter's payment and timely file each succeeding quarterly payment in the amounts prescribed in section 15a. This subsection applies to contributions beginning in the 2013 tax year. The unemployment agency shall include a description of the optional payment method described in this subsection on the form, whether electronic or otherwise, that it provides to contributing employers for the payment of taxes and contributions required under this section. As used in this subsection, "eligible contributing employer" means a contributing employer that employed either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) 25 or fewer individuals during the pay period that includes January 12, 2022.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) 100 or fewer individuals during the pay period that includes March 31, 2022 or during the corresponding pay period in a succeeding calendar year.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 13l.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An Indian tribe or tribal unit liable as an employer under section 41 shall pay reimbursements in lieu of contributions under the same terms and conditions as all other reimbursing employers liable under section 41, unless the Indian tribe or tribal unit elects to pay contributions.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An Indian tribe or tribal unit that elects to make contributions shall file with the unemployment agency a written request for that election before January 1 of the calendar year in which the election will be effective or within 30 days of the effective date of the amendatory act that added this section. The Indian tribe or tribal unit shall determine if the election to pay contributions will apply to the tribe as a whole, will apply only to individual tribal units, or will apply to stated combinations of individual tribal units.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   An Indian tribe or tribal unit paying reimbursements in lieu of contributions shall be billed for the full amount of benefits attributable to service in the employ of the Indian tribe or tribal unit. An Indian tribe or tribal unit shall reimburse the fund annually within 30 calendar days after the mailing of the final billing for the immediately preceding calendar year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If an Indian tribe or tribal unit fails to make payments in lieu of contributions, including assessments of interest and penalties, within 90 calendar days after the mailing of the notice of delinquency, the Indian tribe will lose the ability to make payments in lieu of contributions immediately unless the payment in full or collection on the security is received by the unemployment agency by December 1 of that calendar year. An Indian tribe that loses the ability to make payments in lieu of contributions shall be made a contributing employer and shall not have the ability to make payments in lieu of contributions until all contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, interest, or penalties have been paid. The ability to make payments in lieu of contributions shall be reinstated effective the January 1 immediately succeeding the year in which the Indian tribe has paid in full all contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, interest, and penalties. If an Indian tribe fails to pay in full all contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, interest, and penalties within 90 calendar days of a notice of delinquency, the unemployment agency shall immediately notify the United States department of labor and the internal revenue service of the United States department of treasury of that delinquency. If that delinquency is satisfied, the unemployment agency shall immediately notify the United States department of labor and the internal revenue service of the United States department of treasury that all contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, interest, and penalties have been paid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A notice of delinquency to an Indian tribe or tribal unit shall include information that failure to make full payment within 90 days of the date of mailing of the notice of delinquency will result in the Indian tribe losing the ability to make payments in lieu of contributions until the delinquency and all contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, interest, and penalties have been paid in full.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Any Indian tribe or tribal unit that makes reimbursement payments in lieu of contributions shall be required to post a security, subject to all of the following conditions:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A reimbursing tribe or tribal unit must either post the security within 30 days of the effective date of the amendatory act that added this section or by November 30 of the year before the year for which the security is required.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The security shall be in the form of a surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or other banking device that is acceptable to the unemployment agency and that provides for payment to the unemployment agency, on demand, of an amount equal to the security that is required to be posted. The required security may be posted by a third-party guarantor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The requirement for a security does not apply to an Indian tribe or tribal unit that is expected to have less than $100,000.00 per calendar year in total wage payments, as determined by the unemployment agency. An Indian tribe or tribal unit is required to provide security if the payment of gross wages in a calendar year is equal to or greater than $100,000.00. The employer shall notify the unemployment agency within 60 days from the date its payroll equals or exceeds $100,000.00. The security shall be posted within 30 days of notice by the unemployment agency of a requirement to post a security.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The amount of the security required is 4.0% of the employer's estimated total annual wage payments, as determined by the unemployment agency. Indian tribes or tribal units that have a previous wage payment history shall be required to file a security that is equal to 4.0% of the gross wages paid for the 12-month period ending June 30 of the year immediately preceding the year for which the security is required or 4.0% of the employer's estimated total annual wages, whichever is greater.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Any Indian tribe or tribal unit that is liable for reimbursements in lieu of contributions may form a group account with another tribe or tribal unit, in the same manner and with the same restrictions provided in section 13e(3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Notwithstanding section 41(1), after December 20, 2000, "employer" includes an Indian tribe or tribal unit for which services are performed in employment as defined in subsection (9).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   After December 20, 2000, "employment" includes service performed in the employ of an Indian tribe or tribal unit, if the service is excluded from employment as that term is defined in the federal unemployment tax act, chapter 23 of subtitle C of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. 3301 to 3311, solely by reason of section 3306(c)(7) of the federal unemployment tax act, chapter 23 of subtitle C of the internal revenue code of 1986, and is not otherwise excluded from the definition of employment under section 43.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   As used in this act:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Indian tribe" means that term as defined in section 3306(u) of the federal unemployment tax act, chapter 23 of subtitle C of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. 3306.</DIV>

A PEO determined to be a liable employer shall complete an electronic employer registration in the manner approved by the agency to register its employer liability.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The PEO shall comply with all requirements of this act that apply to a contributing employer. The PEO shall file a single quarterly wage report and unemployment contribution report and pay contributions of its client employers based on the account information of each client employer. The unemployment agency shall convert a reimbursing employer to a contributing employer beginning with the calendar quarter in which the employer becomes a client employer of a PEO. The PEO shall file reports required under R 421.121 of the Michigan administrative code and make contribution payments by electronic reporting and payment methods approved by the agency. The PEO shall notify the agency within 30 days after any employer becomes its client employer and within 30 days after any client employer discontinues its association with the PEO. All of the following apply to a rate calculation for client employers of the PEO:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) For a client employer that is a contributing employer and was a client employer of the PEO on the date that the PEO changed to the reporting method provided in this subdivision, the following rates apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) Except as provided in sub-subparagraphs (B) and (C), if the client employer reported no employees or no payroll to the agency for 8 or more calendar quarters or, beginning January 1, 2014, for 12 or more calendar quarters, the client employer's unemployment tax rate will be the new employer tax rate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) If the client employer was a client employer of the PEO for less than 8 calendar quarters or, beginning January 1, 2014, for less than 12 calendar quarters, the client employer's unemployment tax rate will be based on the client employer's prior account and experience.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(C) If the client employer's account has been terminated for more than 1 year or if the client employer never previously registered with the agency, the client shall be separately registered using a method approved by the agency within 30 days after the employer becomes a client employer of the PEO. The client employer shall be assigned the new employer unemployment tax rate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A business entity that is a contributing employer and becomes a client employer of the PEO on or after January 1, 2014 shall retain its existing unemployment tax rate or establish a new rate as provided in section 19.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A PEO that is a liable employer and that was operating in this state before January 1, 2011 may elect and use the reporting method in subdivision (a) before January 1, 2014, but shall report using the method in subdivision (a) on and after January 1, 2014.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A PEO that is a liable employer is the employer for purposes of claims management and hearings under this act on behalf of the client employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A PEO that reports under subsection (2)(a) shall confirm the mailing address of the client employer, which may be stated as that of the PEO or of the client employer. The PEO shall disclose the business address of the client employer, which shall be the physical address of the client employer, to the agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Either the PEO that reports under subsection (2)(a) or the PEO's client employers, but not both, shall file a quarterly wage detail report electronically, and shall file a quarterly contribution payment in a manner approved by the agency. If a client entity of a PEO leases some of its employees from the PEO but retains the remainder of its employees, the leased employees shall be reported by the PEO under the client entity's unemployment insurance agency account number and the retained employees shall be reported by the client entity under an agency-assigned subaccount number of the client entity's account number.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The agency shall issue a FUTA certification in accordance with the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 1 to 9834, and regulations, rulings, instructions, and directives of the internal revenue service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The requirements of this section do not preclude the agency from enforcing any provision of this act based on any act or omission by a PEO that occurred before January 1, 2011.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this section, "professional employer organization" or "PEO" means that term as defined in R 421.190(1)(d) of the Michigan administrative code.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The commission, after affording reasonable opportunity for the submission of relevant information in writing or in person, may make determinations with respect to whether an employing unit constitutes an employer and whether services performed for or in connection with the business of an employing unit constitute employment for that employing unit subject to this act.

If evidence is presented indicating that an employing unit which has been determined not to be an employer is or was actually an employer, or that services which have been held not to constitute employment are or were actually employment, the previous determination shall be reopened and reconsidered by the commission in accordance with section 32a and a redetermination made as the facts and law require; but in the absence of fraud, if the employing unit is finally found to constitute an employer or to be liable for contributions with respect to services previously held nonsubject, contributions with respect to those services shall not be collectible for any period before the first day of the last completed calendar year preceding the reopening of the determination.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Contributions unpaid on the date on which they are due and payable, as prescribed by the unemployment agency, and unpaid restitution of benefit overpayments, except as otherwise provided under this subsection, bear interest at the rate of 1% per month, computed on a day-to-day basis for each day the delinquency is unpaid, from and after that date until payment plus accrued interest is received by the unemployment agency. The interest on unpaid contributions and on unpaid restitution of benefit overpayments, exclusive of penalties, must not exceed 50% of the amount of contributions due at due date or 50% of the amount of restitution owing. Nothing in this act authorizes the assessment or collection of interest on a penalty imposed under this act. Interest collected under this section must be paid into the contingent fund. Penalties collected under this section must be credited pursuant to section 54(k). With regard to contribution payments, the unemployment agency may cancel any interest and any penalty when it is shown that the failure to pay on or before the last day on which the tax could have been paid without interest and penalty was not the result of negligence, intentional disregard of the rules of the unemployment agency, or fraud. All of the following apply to interest on unpaid restitution of benefit overpayments:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in subdivisions (2) and (3), interest begins accruing 1 year after the date the unemployment agency's determination or redetermination or an administrative law judge's, the Michigan compensation appellate commission's, or a court's order that a claimant owes restitution is final.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The unemployment agency shall not assess interest for improperly paid benefits that were the result of an administrative or clerical error made by the unemployment agency. Interest assessed for improperly paid benefits that is later determined to have been the result of an administrative or clerical error made by the unemployment agency must be waived, and any payment made by a claimant for such interest must be refunded.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the unemployment agency determines or redetermines or an administrative law judge, the Michigan compensation appellate commission, or a court orders that a claimant made an intentional false statement, misrepresentation, or concealed material information to obtain or increase benefits, interest begins accruing on the date the unemployment agency's determination or redetermination or the order is final.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The unemployment agency may make assessments against an employer, claimant, employee of the unemployment agency, or third party who fails to pay contributions, restitution of benefit overpayments, reimbursement payments in lieu of contributions, penalties, forfeitures, or interest as required by this act. The unemployment agency shall immediately notify the employer, claimant, employee of the unemployment agency, or third party of the assessment in writing by first-class mail. The unemployment agency shall not make an assessment against a claimant, an employee of the unemployment agency, or a third party under this subsection unless the assessment is for a penalty for a violation of section 54(a) or (b) or sections 54a to 54c. An assessment made under this subsection is a final determination unless the employer, claimant, employee of the unemployment agency, or third party files with the unemployment agency an application for a redetermination of the assessment pursuant to section 32a. A review by the unemployment agency or an appeal to an administrative law judge or the Michigan compensation appellate commission on the assessment does not reopen a question concerning an employer's liability for contributions or reimbursement payments in lieu of contributions or a claimant's entitlement to benefits, unless the claimant or employer was not a party to the proceeding or decision where the basis for the assessment was determined. An employer may pay an assessment under protest and file an action to recover the amount paid as provided under subsection (d). If an assessment is not paid within 15 days after it becomes final, the unemployment agency may issue a warrant under its official seal for the collection of the assessed amount. The unemployment agency, through its authorized employees and under a warrant issued, may place a lien on any bank account of a claimant or employer and may levy upon and sell the property of an employer that is used in connection with the employer's business, or that is subject to a notice to withhold, found within this state, for the payment of the amount of the contributions including penalties, interests, and the cost of executing the warrant. Property of the employer used in connection with the employer's business is not exempt from levy under the warrant. Wages subject to a notice to withhold are exempt to the extent the wages are exempt from garnishment under the laws of this state. The warrant must be returned to the unemployment agency together with the money collected under the warrant within the time specified in the warrant which must not be less than 20 or more than 90 days after the date of the warrant. The unemployment agency shall proceed upon the warrant as prescribed by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments by a court of record. This state, through the unemployment agency or some other officer or agent designated by it, may bid for and purchase property sold under this subsection. If an employer, claimant, employee of the unemployment agency, or third party is delinquent in the payment of a contribution, reimbursement payment in lieu of contribution, penalty, forfeiture, or interest provided for in this act, the unemployment agency may give notice of the amount of the delinquency served either personally or by mail, to a person or legal entity, including this state and its subdivisions, that has in its possession or under its control a credit or other intangible property belonging to the employer, claimant, employee of the unemployment agency, or third party, or who owes a debt to the employer, claimant, employee of the unemployment agency, or third party at the time of the receipt of the notice. A person or legal entity that is notified shall not transfer or dispose of the credit, other intangible property, or debt without retaining an amount sufficient to pay the amount specified in the notice unless the unemployment agency consents to a transfer or disposition or 45 days have elapsed from the receipt of the notice. A person or legal entity that is notified shall advise the unemployment agency within 5 days after receipt of the notice of a credit, other intangible property, or debt, that is in its possession, under its control, or owed by it. A person or legal entity that is notified and that transfers or disposes of credits or personal property in violation of this section is liable to the unemployment agency for the value of the property or the amount of the debts thus transferred or paid, but not more than the amount specified in the notice. An amount due a delinquent employer, claimant, employee of the unemployment agency, or third party subject to a notice to withhold must be paid to the unemployment agency upon service upon the debtor of a warrant issued under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) In addition to the mode of collection provided in subsection (b), if, after proper notice, an employer defaults in payment of contributions or interest on the contributions, or a claimant, employee of the unemployment agency, or third party defaults in the payment of a penalty, the unemployment agency may bring an action at law in a court of competent jurisdiction to collect and recover the amount of a contribution, and any interest on the contribution, or the penalty, and in addition 10% of the amount of contributions or penalties found to be due, as damages. An employer, claimant, employee of the unemployment agency, or third party adjudged in default shall pay costs of the action. The unemployment agency shall not bring an action against a claimant, employee of the unemployment agency, or third party under this subsection unless the action is brought only to recover penalties for violations of section 54(a) or (b) or sections 54a to 54c. A court shall hear civil actions brought under this section at the earliest possible date. If a judgment is obtained against an employer for contributions and an execution on that judgment is returned unsatisfied, a court may enjoin the employer from operating and doing business in this state until the judgment is satisfied. The circuit court of the county in which the judgment is docketed, or the Ingham County circuit court, may grant an injunction upon the petition of the unemployment agency. A copy of the petition for injunction and a notice of when and where the court shall act on the petition must be served on the employer at least 21 days before the court may grant the injunction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) An employer or employing unit improperly charged or assessed contributions provided for under this act, or a claimant, employee of the unemployment agency, or third party improperly assessed a penalty under this act and who paid the contributions or penalty under protest within 30 days after the mailing of the notice of determination of assessment, may recover the amount improperly collected or paid, together with interest, in any proper action against the unemployment agency. The circuit court of the county in which the employer or employing unit or claimant, employee of the unemployment agency, or third party resides, or, in the case of an employer or employing unit, in which the principal office or place of business of the employer or employing unit is located, has original jurisdiction of an action to recover contributions improperly paid or collected or a penalty improperly assessed whether or not the charge or assessment has been reviewed by the unemployment agency or heard or reviewed by an administrative law judge or the Michigan compensation appellate commission. The court does not have jurisdiction of the action unless written notice of the claim is given to the unemployment agency at least 30 days before the institution of the action. In an action to recover contributions paid or collected or penalties assessed, the court shall allow costs it considers proper. Either party to the action has the same right of appeal as provided by law in other civil actions. A claimant, employee of the unemployment agency, or third party shall not bring an action against the unemployment agency under this subsection unless it is brought only to recover penalties and interest on those penalties improperly assessed by the unemployment agency under section 54(a) or (b) or sections 54a to 54c. If a final judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiff in an action to recover the amount of contributions illegally collected or charged, the treasurer of the unemployment agency, upon receipt of a certified copy of the final judgment, shall pay the amount of contributions illegally collected or charged or penalties assessed from the clearing account, and pay interest as allowed by the court, in an amount not to exceed the actual earnings of the contributions as found to have been illegally collected or charged, from the contingent fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Except for liens and encumbrances recorded before the filing of the notice provided for in this section, all contributions, interest, and penalties payable under this act to the unemployment agency from an employer, claimant, employee of the unemployment agency, or third party that neglects to pay the same when due are a first and prior lien upon all property and rights to property, real and personal, belonging to the employer, claimant, employee of the unemployment agency, or third party. The lien continues until the liability for that amount or a judgment arising out of the liability is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time. The lien attaches to the property and rights to property of the employer, claimant, employee of the unemployment agency, or third party, whether real or personal, from and after the required filing date of the report upon which the specific tax is computed. Notice of the lien must be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the county in which the property subject to the lien is situated, and the register of deeds shall accept the notice for recording. Notice of the lien may also be filed with the secretary of state pursuant to the state tax lien registration act, 1968 PA 203, MCL 211.681 to 211.687. This subsection applies only to penalties and interest on those penalties assessed by the unemployment agency against a claimant, employee of the unemployment agency, or third party for violations of section 54(a) or (b) or sections 54a to 54c.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>If there is a distribution of an employer's assets pursuant to an order of a court under the laws of this state, including a receivership, assignment for benefit of creditors, adjudicated insolvency, composition, or similar proceedings, contributions then or thereafter due must be paid in full before all other claims except for wages and compensation under the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.101 to 418.941. In the distribution of estates of decedents, claims for funeral expenses and expenses of last sickness are also entitled to priority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A court shall not issue an injunction to stay proceedings for the assessment or collection of a contribution, or interest or penalty on a contribution, levied and required by this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) A person or employing unit that acquires the organization, trade, business, or 75% or more of the assets from an employing unit, as a successor described in section 41(2), is liable for contributions and interest due to the unemployment agency from the transferor at the time of the acquisition in an amount not to exceed the reasonable value of the organization, trade, business, or assets acquired, less the amount of a secured interest in the assets owned by the transferee that are entitled to priority. If a transferor or transferee who has, not less than 10 days before the acquisition, requested from the unemployment agency in writing a statement certifying the status of contribution liability of the transferor, the unemployment agency shall provide the transferor or transferee with that statement and the transferee is not liable for any amount due from the transferor in excess of the amount of liability computed as prescribed in this subsection and certified by the unemployment agency. At least 2 calendar days not including a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday before the acceptance of an offer, the transferor, or the transferor's real estate broker or other agent representing the transferor, shall disclose to the transferee on a form provided by the unemployment agency the amounts of the transferor's outstanding unemployment tax liability, unreported unemployment tax liability, and the tax payments, tax rates, and cumulative benefit charges for the most recent 5 years; a listing of all individuals currently employed by the transferor; and a listing of all employees separated from employment with the transferor in the most recent 12 months. The form must specify any other information the unemployment agency determines is required for a transferee to estimate future unemployment compensation costs based on the transferor's benefit charge and unemployment tax reporting and payment experience. Failure of the transferor, or the transferor's real estate broker or other agent representing the transferor, to provide accurate information required by this subsection is a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or a fine of not more than $2,500.00, or both. In addition, the transferor, or the transferor's real estate broker or other agent representing the transferor, is liable to the transferee for any consequential damages resulting from the failure to comply with this subsection. However, the real estate broker or other agent is not liable for consequential damages if he or she exercised good faith in compliance with the disclosure of information. The remedy provided the transferee is not exclusive, and does not reduce any other right or remedy against any party provided for in this or any other act. Nothing in this subsection decreases the liability of the transferee as a successor in interest, or prevents the transfer of a rating account balance as provided in this act. The remedies under this subsection are in addition to the remedies the unemployment agency has against the transferor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) If a part of a deficiency in payment of the employer's contribution to the fund is due to negligence or intentional disregard of unemployment agency rules, but without intention to defraud, 5% of the total amount of the deficiency, in addition to the deficiency and all other interest charges and penalties provided herein, must be assessed, collected, and paid in the same manner as a deficiency. If a part of a deficiency is determined in an action at law to be the result of fraud with intent to avoid payment of contributions to the fund, then the judgment rendered must include an amount equal to 50% of the total amount of the deficiency, in addition to the deficiency and all other interest charges and penalties provided herein.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If an employing unit fails to make a report as reasonably required by the rules of the unemployment agency pursuant to this act, the unemployment agency may estimate the liability of that employing unit from information it obtains and, according to that estimate, assess the employing unit for the contributions, penalties, and interest due. The unemployment agency may act under this subsection only after a default continues for 30 days and after the unemployment agency has determined that the default of the employing unit is willful.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) An assessment or penalty with respect to contributions unpaid is not effective for any period before the 3 calendar years preceding the date of the assessment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) The rights respecting the collection of contributions and the levy of interest and penalties and damages made available to the unemployment agency by this section are additional to other powers and rights vested in the unemployment agency under other provisions of this act. The unemployment agency may exercise any of the collection remedies under this act even though an application for a redetermination or an appeal is pending final disposition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) A person recording a lien or a discharge of a lien under this section shall pay to the register of deeds a recording fee that is equivalent to the fee for entering and recording a mortgage as authorized under section 2567 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.2567.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) In addition to the restitution recoupment methods in section 62, the unemployment agency may obtain restitution due from a claimant as a result of a benefit overpayment that has become final by any of the following methods: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Levy of a bank account belonging to the claimant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Entry into a wage assignment with the claimant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Issuing an administrative garnishment of the wages of the claimant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) To obtain an administrative garnishment, the unemployment agency must notify the claimant of its intention to issue an administrative garnishment on the claimant's employer and the amount determined to be due from the claimant. The notice must include a demand for immediate payment of the amount due, a statement that it is not subject to appeal, and a statement that the claimant may, within 30 days of the issuance of the notice, object to the garnishment by providing information to the agency, with supporting documentation, that the claimant does not owe the stated amount of restitution. Not less than 30 days after issuing the notice to the claimant, the unemployment agency shall notify the claimant's employer to withhold from earnings due or to become due from the claimant the amount shown on the notice plus accrued interest. The employer shall comply with the notice to withhold and shall continue to withhold each pay period the amount shown on the notice plus accrued interest until the garnishment amount plus accrued interest has been satisfied and the notice is released by the unemployment agency. The unemployment agency's administrative garnishment has priority over any subsequent garnishment or wage assignment. The amount subject to garnishment for any pay period must be decreased by any other irrevocable and previously effective assignment of wages or other garnishment action served on the employer before service of the agency's garnishment notice. The amount of the unemployment agency's garnishment must not exceed 25% of the balance. In response to the administrative garnishment, the employer shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Within 10 calendar days after the date of the unemployment agency's notice to withhold wages, notify the unemployment agency of the amount of any irrevocable and previously effective assignment of wages or garnishment actions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Within 10 days after the end of each pay period in which wages are required to be withheld under the administrative garnishment, remit to the unemployment agency the amount withheld pursuant to the administrative garnishment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Within 10 days after the date on which the claimant ceases to be employed by the employer, notify the unemployment agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(o) Before payment of a prize of $1,000.00 or more under the McCauley-Traxler-Law-Bowman-McNeeley lottery act, 1972 PA 239, MCL 432.1 to 432.47, the bureau of state lottery shall determine whether a lottery prize winner has a current liability for restitution of unemployment benefits, penalty, or interest, assessed by the unemployment agency and the amount of the prize owing to the unemployment agency and shall remit that amount to the unemployment agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(p) If the unemployment agency does not record the discharge of lien with the register of deeds and seek reimbursement for that recording fee, the unemployment agency shall provide the discharge of lien document and a notice of lien recording fee to the debtor, who is then responsible for recording the discharge and paying the applicable amounts required under section 2567 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.2567. The notice of lien recording fee must state the amount of the recording fee the unemployment agency paid for recording the lien that is the subject of the discharge and may include any other relevant information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(q) In addition to any other remedy provided under this act, the unemployment agency may seek to recover unemployment compensation debt as provided by 26 USC 6402(f), 42 USC 503(m), or other applicable federal law. The debtor is liable for any fee the federal government imposes with respect to implementing the deduction from a federal tax refund.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If not later than 3 years after the date of payment of any amount as contributions or interest thereon, an employing unit which has paid such amount shall make application for an adjustment or refund thereof the commission shall determine whether such contributions or interest or any portion thereof was erroneously collected; and the employing unit shall be promptly notified of such determination, which shall become final unless the employing unit files with the commission an application for redetermination thereof in accordance with the provisions of section 32a. If it is finally determined, redetermined or otherwise decided that any amount thus at issue was erroneously collected, the commission shall allow such employing unit to make an adjustment thereof, without interest, in connection with subsequent contribution payments by him. If the adjustment cannot be made within the ensuing 3 months the commission shall refund the amount, without interest, from the appropriate fund or funds. For like cause, in the same manner, and within the same period, adjustment or refund may be made by the commission on its own initiative. When the individual owner of an employing unit who is entitled to a refund dies or is legally declared insane or mentally incompetent, the refund shall become due and payable to the person who appears to the commission upon investigation to be the legal heir or guardian of the individual owner, or to any other person found by the commission to be equitably entitled to the refund by reason of having incurred expenses in behalf of the individual owner for his burial or other necessary expenses.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The unemployment agency shall maintain in the unemployment compensation fund a nonchargeable benefits account and a separate experience account for each employer as provided in this section. This act does not give an employer or individuals in the employer's service prior claims or rights to the amount paid by the employer to the unemployment compensation fund. All contributions to that fund must be pooled and available to pay benefits to any individual entitled to the benefits under this act, irrespective of the source of the contributions.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) All net earnings received on money, property, or securities in the fund.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The amount of any benefit check or other payment issued that would be chargeable to the experience account of an employer who has ceased to be subject to this act, and who has had a balance transferred from the employer's experience account to the solvency or nonchargeable benefits account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) All benefits that become nonchargeable to an employer under section 19(b) or (c), 29(1)(a)(i) to (iv) or (3), or 42a.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) All contributions paid by an employer must be credited to the unemployment compensation fund, and, except as otherwise provided with respect to the proceeds of the nonchargeable benefits component of employers' contribution rates by section 19(a)(5), to the employer's experience account, as of the date when paid. However, the contributions paid during any July shall be credited as of the immediately preceding June 30. Additional contributions paid by an employer as the result of a retroactive contribution rate adjustment, solely for the purpose of this subsection, must be credited to the employer's experience account as if paid when due, if the payment is received within 30 days after the issuance of the initial assessment that results from the contribution rate adjustment and a written request for the application is filed by the employer during this period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If an employer who has ceased to be subject to this act, and who has had a positive or negative balance transferred as provided in subsection (2) or (3) from the employer's experience account to the solvency or nonchargeable benefits account as of the second computation date after the employer has ceased to be subject to this act, becomes subject to this act again within 6 years after that computation date, the unemployment agency shall transfer the positive or negative balance, adjusted by the debits and credits that are made after the date of transfer, to the employer's new experience account. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If an employer's status as a reimbursing employer is terminated within 6 years after the date the employer's experience account as a prior contributing employer was transferred to the solvency or nonchargeable benefits account as provided in subsection (2) or (3) and the employer continues to be subject to this act as a contributing employer, any positive or negative balance in the employer's experience account as a prior contributing employer that was transferred to the solvency or nonchargeable benefits account must be transferred to the employer's new experience account.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a balance is transferred to an employer's new account under subsection (5) or (6), the employer is not considered a "qualified employer" until the employer has again been subject to this act for the period set forth in section 19(a)(1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) All money credited under section 903 of the social security act, 42 USC 1103, to the account of the state in the federal unemployment trust fund must immediately be credited by the unemployment agency to the fund's nonchargeable benefits account. There is authorized to be appropriated to the unemployment agency from the money credited to the nonchargeable benefits account under this subsection, an amount determined to be necessary for the proper and efficient administration by the unemployment agency of this act for purposes for which federal grants under title 3 of the social security act, 42 USC 501 to 505, and the Wagner-Peyser act, 29 USC 49 to 49l-2, are not available or are insufficient. The appropriation expires not more than 2 years after the date of enactment and must provide that any unexpended balance is credited to the nonchargeable benefits account. An appropriation under this subsection must not exceed the "adjusted balance" of the nonchargeable benefits account on the most recent computation date. Appropriations made under this subsection must limit the total amount that may be obligated by the unemployment agency during a fiscal year to an amount that does not exceed the amount by which the aggregate of the amounts credited to the nonchargeable benefits account under this subsection during the fiscal year and the 24 preceding fiscal years, exceeds the aggregate of the amounts obligated by the unemployment agency by appropriation under this subsection and charged against the amounts thus credited to the nonchargeable benefits account during any of the 25 fiscal years and any amounts credited to the nonchargeable benefits account that have been used for the payment of benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, any benefit paid to a claimant that is laid off or placed on a leave of absence must not be charged to the account of any employer who otherwise would have been charged but instead must be charged to the nonchargeable benefits account. This subsection does not apply after March 31, 2021.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 18.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   As used in this act:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Computation date" means June 30 of each year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Balance" means:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   As applied to an employer's experience account or to the nonchargeable benefits account, the initial balance of that account plus the credits and minus the charges that are made in accordance with this act. A "negative balance" in an experience account exists when its balance is a minus quantity.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   As applied to the fund, the sum obtained by adding the total money received by the fund through the date in question plus interest earnings credited to the fund by the United States treasury as of or before that date, and subtracting:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Amounts received by the fund from the federal government as advances to pay benefits under a federal act but not used as yet for that purpose.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Advances made to the fund by the federal government under section 1201 of the social security act, 42 U.S.C. 1321, that have not been repaid to, canceled, or recovered by the federal government.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   Amounts that may have been appropriated by the legislature in accordance with section 903(c)(2) of the social security act, 42 U.S.C. 1103(c)(2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)   All disbursements from the fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   "Adjusted balance", as applied to the nonchargeable benefits account, means the balance of that account minus its contingent liabilities, namely, the amount of advances made to the fund by the federal government under section 1201 of the social security act, 42 U.S.C. 1321, that have not been repaid to, canceled, or recovered by the federal government, and the total amount of negative balances in employer experience accounts.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The "experience component" of an employer's contribution rate means the sum of the employer's chargeable benefits and account building components.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If at least 1 but fewer than all of the applicable quarterly reports of wages and contributions due with respect to the 12-month period ending on the computation date have been filed by an employer, the employer's experience component shall be set so that his or her contribution rate for the calendar year affected shall be the rate set in accordance with section 19(a), and in addition a penalty of 3% of wages paid to an individual with respect to employment, subject to the taxable wage limit, shall be imposed on the employer. The commission shall calculate the rate using the information filed by the employer for the quarter or quarters reported. If none of the applicable quarterly reports of wages and contributions due with respect to the 12-month period ending on the computation date have been filed by an employer, the employer's experience component shall be set so that the employer's contribution rate for the calendar year affected shall be not less than the highest rate applicable to the number of years of the employer's contribution liability in accordance with section 19(a), and in addition a penalty of 3% of wages paid to an individual with respect to employment, subject to the taxable wage limit, shall be imposed on the employer. An employer whose contribution rate and penalty have been determined under this section may have his or her contribution rate redetermined in accordance with section 19(a) and may have his or her penalty redetermined and removed if the employer files all of the missing reports not later than 30 days after the date of mailing of the notice of determination of contribution rate. An employer who files all of the missing reports after the 30 days but not later than 1 year after the date of mailing of the determination of contribution rate and penalty shall have his or her contribution rate redetermined in accordance with section 19(a) and shall have his or her penalty redetermined to 2%. However, if the commission finds that the employer had good cause for filing the missing reports after the 30-day period but within 1 year, the commission shall redetermine the employer's contribution rate in accordance with section 19(a) and shall redetermine and remove the penalty. The commission may by rule prescribe good cause reasons for removing the penalty. Notwithstanding section 32a, if the employer files all of the missing reports after 1 year, good cause shall not be considered, but the employer's contribution rate shall be redetermined in accordance with section 19(a) and the employer's penalty shall remain at 3%. A penalty paid by an employer pursuant to this section shall not be credited to the employer's experience account nor to the unemployment compensation fund. The penalty shall be credited to the interest and penalty account of the contingent fund. A contribution rate for a tax year may not be redetermined under this subsection if the missing reports for that year are received more than 3 years after the rate determination for the year is issued with respect to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1991.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   "Cost criterion" means the number arrived at as of each computation date through the following calculations:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   With respect to each period of 12 consecutive months starting after 1956, calculate the percentage ratio of the benefits paid during the 12 months to the aggregate amount of the payrolls paid by employers within the most recent calendar year completed before the start of the 12-month period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Select the largest percentage ratio, which is referred to as the "cost criterion", to be used as of that computation date.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For purposes of this subsection, "benefits" do not include benefits paid under a federal law or that are reimbursable or have been reimbursed by the federal government, and "payroll" does not include remuneration paid by this state and other employers who make reimbursement payments instead of contributions.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   "Payroll" means remuneration paid by a contributing employer for employment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Notwithstanding the definition of "balance" as applied to the fund and of "adjusted balance" as applied to the nonchargeable benefits account by subsections (b) and (c), if the federal unemployment tax act, 26 U.S.C. 3301 to 3311 or the social security act, 42 U.S.C. 301 to 1397e, is amended to cancel the liability of employers in this state to pay additional federal unemployment taxes under the reduced credit provisions of section 3302(c) of the federal unemployment tax act, 26 U.S.C. 3302(c), otherwise applicable to the then unpaid balance of money advanced to the Michigan unemployment fund since 1974, the amount of that part of the unpaid balance shall be included in the balance of the unemployment fund and in the adjusted balance of the nonchargeable benefits account.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The commission shall determine the contribution rate of each contributing employer for each calendar year after 1977 as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (ii), an employer's rate shall be calculated as described in table A, A-1, or A-2 with respect to wages paid by the employer in each calendar year for employment. If an employer's coverage is terminated under section 24, or at the conclusion of 12 or more consecutive calendar quarters during which the employer has not had workers in covered employment, and if the employer again becomes liable for contributions, the employer shall be considered as newly liable for contributions for the purposes of the tables in this subsection. An employer that becomes liable under section 41(2) will not be assigned the new employer rate but instead the employer's most recent prior rate as a predecessor employer will be assigned to its new account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) To provide against the high risk of net loss to the fund in such cases, an employing unit that becomes newly liable for contributions under this act in a calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 1983 in which it employs in "employment", not necessarily simultaneously but in any 1 week 2 or more individuals in the performance of 1 or more contracts or subcontracts for construction in the state of roads, bridges, highways, sewers, water mains, utilities, public buildings, factories, housing developments, or similar construction projects, shall be liable for contributions to that employer's account under this act for the first 4 years of operations in this state at a rate equal to the average rate paid by employers engaged in the construction business as determined by contractor type in the manner provided in table B, B-1, or B-2.</div>

  </table><B></B>(2) With the exception of employers who are in the first 4 consecutive years of liability, each employer's contribution rate shall be the sum of the following components, all of which are determined as of the computation date: a chargeable benefits component determined under subdivision (3), an account building component determined under subdivision (4), and a nonchargeable benefits component determined under subdivision (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3)(i) For calendar years beginning before January 1, 2012, the chargeable benefits component of an employer's contribution rate is the percentage determined by dividing: the total amount of benefits charged to the employer's experience account within the lesser of 60 consecutive months ending on the computation date or the number of consecutive months ending on the computation date with respect to which the employer has been continuously liable for contributions; by the amount of wages, subject to contributions, paid by the employer within the same period. If the resulting quotient is not an exact multiple of 1/10 of 1%, it shall be increased to the next higher multiple of 1/10 of 1%. For the calendar year 2012, the chargeable benefits component of an employer's contribution rate is the percentage determined by dividing: the total amount of benefits charged to the employer's experience account within the lesser of 48 consecutive months ending on the computation date or the number of consecutive months ending on the computation date with respect to which the employer has been continuously liable for contributions; by the amount of wages, subject to contributions, paid by the employer within the same period. If the resulting quotient is not an exact multiple of 1/10 of 1%, it shall be increased to the next higher multiple of 1/10 of 1%. For each calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2013, the chargeable benefits component of an employer's contribution rate is the percentage determined by dividing: the total amount of benefits charged to the employer's experience account within the lesser of 36 consecutive months ending on the computation date or the number of consecutive months ending on the computation date with respect to which the employer has been continuously liable for contributions; by the amount of wages, subject to contributions, paid by the employer within the same period. If the resulting quotient is not an exact multiple of 1/10 of 1%, it shall be increased to the next higher multiple of 1/10 of 1%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) For benefit years established before October 1, 2000, the chargeable benefits component shall not exceed 6.0%, unless there is a statutory change in the maximum duration of regular benefit payments or the statutory ratio of regular benefit payments to credit weeks. In the event of a change in the maximum duration of regular benefit payments, the maximum chargeable benefits component shall increase by the same percentage as the statutory percentage change in the duration of regular benefit payments between computation dates. In the event of an increase in the statutory ratio of regular benefit payments to credit weeks, as described in section 27(d), the maximum chargeable benefits component determined as of the computation dates occurring after the effective date of the increased ratio shall increase by 1/2 the same percentage as the increase in the ratio of regular benefit payments to credit weeks. If the resulting increase is not already an exact multiple of 1/10 of 1%, it shall be adjusted to the next higher multiple of 1/10 of 1%. For benefit years established after October 1, 2000, the chargeable benefits component shall not exceed 6.0%, unless there is a statutory change in the maximum duration of regular benefit payments or the percentage factor of base period wages, which defines maximum duration, as provided in section 27(d). If there is a statutory change in the maximum duration of regular benefit payments, the maximum chargeable benefits component shall increase by the same percentage as the statutory percentage change in the duration of regular benefit payments between computation dates. If there is an increase in the statutory percentage factor of base period wages, as described in section 27(d), the maximum chargeable benefits component determined as of the computation dates occurring after the effective date of the increased ratio shall increase by 1/2 the same percentage as the increase in the percentage factor of base period wages. If the resulting increase is not already an exact multiple of 1/10 of 1%, it shall be adjusted to the next higher multiple of 1/10 of 1%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The account building component of an employer's contribution rate is the percentage arrived at by the following calculations: (i) Multiply the amount of the employer's total payroll for the 12 months ending on the computation date, by the cost criterion; (ii) Subtract the amount of the balance in the employer's experience account as of the computation date from the product determined under (i); and (iii) if the remainder is zero or a negative quantity, the account building component of the employer's contribution rate shall be zero; but (iv) if the remainder is a positive quantity, the account building component of the employer's contribution rate shall be determined by dividing that remainder by the employer's total payroll paid within the 12 months ending on the computation date. The account building component shall not exceed the lesser of 1/4 of the percentage calculated or 2%. However, except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the account building component shall not exceed the lesser of 1/2 of the percentage calculated or 3%, if on the June 30 of the preceding calendar year the balance in the unemployment compensation fund was less than 50% of an amount equal to the aggregate of all contributing employers' annual payrolls, for the 12 months ending March 31, times the cost criterion. For calendar years after 1993 and before 1996, the account building component shall not exceed the lesser of .69 of the percentage calculated, or 3%, if on the June 30 of the preceding calendar year the balance in the unemployment compensation fund was less than 50% of an amount equal to the aggregate of all contributing employers' annual payrolls, for the 12 months ending March 31, as defined in section 18(f), times the cost criterion; selected for the computation date under section 18(e). If the account building component determined under this subdivision is not an exact multiple of 1/10 of 1%, it shall be adjusted to the next higher multiple of 1/10 of 1%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The nonchargeable benefits component of employers' contribution rates is the percentage arrived at by the following calculations: (i) multiply the aggregate amount of all contributing employers' annual payrolls, for the 12 months ending March 31, as defined in section 18(f), by the cost criterion selected for the computation date under section 18(e); (ii) subtract the balance of the unemployment fund on the computation date, net of federal advances, from the product determined under (i); and (iii) if the remainder is zero or a negative quantity, the nonchargeable benefits component of employers' contribution rates shall be zero; but (iv) if the remainder is a positive quantity, the nonchargeable benefits component of employers' contribution rates shall be determined by dividing that remainder by the total of wages subject to contributions under this act paid by all contributing employers within the 12 months ending on March 31 and adjusting the quotient, if not an exact multiple of 1/10 of 1%, to the next higher multiple of 1/10 of 1%. The maximum nonchargeable benefits component shall be 1%. However, for calendar years after 1993, if there are no benefit charges against an employer's account for the 60 months ending as of the computation date, or for calendar years after 1995, if the employer's chargeable benefits component is less than 2/10 of 1%, the maximum nonchargeable benefit component shall not exceed 1/2 of 1%. For calendar years after 1995, if there are no benefit charges against an employer's account for the 72 months ending as of the computation date, the maximum nonchargeable benefits component shall not exceed 4/10 of 1%. For calendar years after 1996, if there are no benefit charges against an employer's account for the 84 months ending as of the computation date, the maximum nonchargeable benefits component shall not exceed 3/10 of 1%. For calendar years after 1997, if there are no benefit charges against an employer's account for the 96 months ending as of the computation date, the maximum nonchargeable benefits component shall not exceed 2/10 of 1%. For calendar years after 1998, if there are no benefit charges against an employer's account for the 108 months ending as of the computation date, the maximum nonchargeable benefits component shall not exceed 1/10 of 1%. For calendar years after 2002, the maximum nonchargeable benefits component shall not exceed 1/10 of 1% if there are no benefit charges against an employer's account for the 60 months ending as of the computation date; 9/100 of 1% if there are no benefit charges against an employer's account for the 72 months ending as of the computation date; 8/100 of 1% if there are no benefit charges against an employer's account for the 84 months ending as of the computation date; 7/100 of 1% if there are no benefit charges against an employer's account for the 96 months ending as of the computation date; or 6/100 of 1% if there are no benefit charges against an employer's account for the 108 months ending as of the computation date. For purposes of determining a nonchargeable benefits component under this subsection, an employer account shall not be considered to have had a charge if claim for benefits is denied or determined to be fraudulent pursuant to section 54 or 54c. An employer with a positive balance in its experience account on the June 30 computation date preceding the calendar year shall receive for that calendar year a credit in an amount equal to 1/2 of the extra federal unemployment tax paid in the preceding calendar year under section 3302(c)(2) of the federal unemployment tax act, 26 USC 3302, because of an outstanding balance of unrepaid advances from the federal government to the unemployment compensation fund under section 1201 of title XII of the social security act, 42 USC 1321. However, the credit for any calendar year shall not exceed an amount determined by multiplying the employer's nonchargeable benefit component for that calendar year times the employer's taxable payroll for that year. Contributions paid by an employer shall be credited to the employer's experience account, in accordance with the provisions of section 17(5), without regard to any credit given under this subsection. The amount credited to an employer's experience account shall be the amount of the employer's tax before deduction of the credit provided in this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The total of the chargeable benefits and account building components of an employer's contribution rate shall not exceed by more than 1% in the 1983 calendar year, 1.5% in the calendar year 1984, or 2% in the 1985 calendar year the higher of 4% or the total of the chargeable benefits and the account building components that applied to the employer during the preceding calendar year. For calendar years after 1985, the total of the chargeable benefits and account building components of the employer's contribution rate shall be computed without regard to the foregoing limitation provided in this subdivision. During a year in which this subdivision limits an employer's contribution rate, the resulting reduction shall be considered to be entirely in the experience component of the employer's contribution rate, as defined in section 18(d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An employer previously liable for contributions under this act which on or after January 1, 1978 filed a petition for arrangement under the bankruptcy act of July 1, 1898, chapter 541, 30 Stat. 544, or on or after October 1, 1979 filed a petition for reorganization under title 11 of the United States Code, 11 USC 101 to 1330, pursuant to which a plan of arrangement or reorganization for rehabilitation purposes has been confirmed by order of the United States bankruptcy court, shall be considered as a reorganized employer and shall have a reserve fund balance of zero as of the first calendar year immediately following court confirmation of the plan of arrangement or reorganization, but not earlier than the calendar year beginning January 1, 1983, if the employer meets each of the following requirements:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An employer whose plan of arrangement or reorganization has been confirmed as of January 1, 1983 shall, within 60 days after January 1, 1983, notify the commission of its intention to elect the status of a reorganized employer. An employer that has not had a plan of arrangement or reorganization confirmed as of January 1, 1983 shall, within 60 days after the entry by the bankruptcy court of the order of confirmation of the plan of arrangement or reorganization, notify the commission of its intention to elect the status of a reorganized employer. An employer shall not make an election under this subdivision after December 31, 1985.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The employer has paid to the commission all contributions previously owed by the employer pursuant to this act for all calendar years prior to the calendar year as to which the employer elects to begin its status as a reorganized employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) More than 50% of the employer's total payroll is paid for services rendered in this state during the employer's fiscal year immediately preceding the date the employer notifies the fund administrator of its intention to elect the status of a reorganized employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The employer, within 180 days after notifying the commission of its intention to elect the status of a reorganized employer, makes a cash payment to the commission, for the unemployment compensation fund, equal to: .20 times the first $2,000,000.00 of the employer's negative balance, .35 times the amount of the employer's negative balance above $2,000,000.00 and up to $5,000,000.00, and .50 times the amount of the negative balance above $5,000,000.00. The total amount determined by the commission shall be based on the employer's negative balance existing as of the end of the calendar month immediately preceding the calendar year in which the employer will begin its status as a reorganized employer. If the employer fails to pay the amount determined, within 180 days of electing status as a reorganized employer, the commission shall reinstate the employer's negative balance previously reduced and redetermine the employer's rate on the basis of the reinstated negative balance. The redetermined rate shall then be used to redetermine the employer's quarterly contributions for that calendar year. The redetermined contributions shall be subject to the interest provisions of section 15 as of the date the redetermined quarterly contributions were originally due.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as provided in subdivision (6), the employer contribution rates for a reorganized employer beginning with the first calendar year of the employer's status as a reorganized employer shall be as follows:
<B></B><table>

      <td>Year of Contribution Liability</td>
      <td>Contribution Rate</td>

  </table><B></B>(c) Upon application by an employer to the commission for designation as a distressed employer, the commission, within 60 days after receipt of the application, shall make a determination whether the employer meets the conditions set forth in this subsection. Upon finding that the conditions are met, the commission shall notify the legislature of the determination and request legislative acquiescence in the determination. If the legislature approves the determination by concurrent resolution, the employer shall be considered to be a "distressed employer" as of January 1 of the year in which the determination is made. The commission shall notify the employer of that determination and notify the employer of its contribution rate as a distressed employer and the contribution rate that would apply if the employer was not a distressed employer. The distressed employer shall determine its tax contribution using the 2 rates furnished by the commission and shall pay its tax contribution based on the lower of the 2 rates. If the determination of distressed employer status is made during the calendar year, the employer shall be entitled to a credit on future quarterly installments for any excess contributions paid during that initial calendar year. The employer shall notify the commission of the difference between the amount paid and the amount that would have been paid if the employer were not determined to be a distressed employer and the difference will be owed to the unemployment compensation fund, payable in accordance with this subsection. Cumulative totals of the difference must be reported to the commission with each return required to be filed. The commission may periodically determine continued eligibility of an employer under this subsection. When the commission makes a determination that an employer no longer qualifies as a distressed employer, the commission shall notify the employer of that determination. After notice by the commission that the employer no longer qualifies as a distressed employer, the employer will be liable for contributions, beginning with the first quarter occurring after receipt of notification of disqualification, on the basis of the rate that would apply if the employer was not a distressed employer. The contribution rate for a distressed employer shall be calculated under the law in effect for the 1982 calendar year except that the rate determined shall be reduced by the applicable solvency tax rate assessed against the employer under section 19a. The distressed employer will pay in 10 equal annual installments the amount of the unpaid contributions owed to the unemployment compensation fund due to the application of this subsection, without interest. Each installment shall be made with the fourth quarterly return for the respective year. As used in this subsection, "distressed employer" means an employer whose continued presence in this state is considered essential to the state's economic well-being and who meets the following criteria:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The employer's average annual Michigan payroll in the 5 previous years exceeded $500,000,000.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The employer's average quarterly number of employees in Michigan in the 5 previous years exceeded 25,000.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The employer's business income as defined in section 3 of the single business tax act, 1975 PA 228, MCL 208.3, or section 105 of the Michigan business tax act, 2007 PA 36, MCL 208.1105, as applicable, has resulted in an aggregate loss of $1,000,000,000.00 or more during the 5-year period ending in the second year prior to the year for which the application is being made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The employer has received from this state loans totaling $50,000,000.00 or more or loan guarantees from the federal government in excess of $500,000,000.00, either of which are still outstanding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Failure to give an employer designation as a distressed employer would adversely impair the employer's ability to repay the outstanding loans owed to this state or that are guaranteed by the federal government.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) An employer may at any time make payments to that employer's experience account in the fund in excess of the requirements of this section, but these payments, when accepted by the commission, shall be irrevocable. A payment made by an employer within 30 days after mailing to the employer by the commission of a notice of the adjusted contribution rate of the employer shall be credited to the employer's account as of the computation date for which the adjusted contribution rate was computed, and the employer's contribution rate shall be further adjusted accordingly. However, a payment made more than 120 days after the beginning of a calendar year shall not affect the employer's contribution rate for that year.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except for the first 4 consecutive years of liability, a contributing employer is subject to a solvency tax for a calendar year after 1982 if the employer's experience account has a negative balance on the June 30 preceding that calendar year, and if on the June 30 preceding that calendar year the balance in the unemployment compensation fund is less than the total amount of unrepaid interest bearing advances from the federal government to the fund under section 1201 of the social security act, 42 USC 1321, or the commission projects that interest will be due during the calendar year on federal advances and there will be insufficient solvency tax funds in the contingent fund to meet the federal interest obligations when due or there are outstanding advances from the state treasury from the previous year and any interest thereon and there will be insufficient solvency tax funds in the contingent fund to repay such advances and interest. The solvency tax rate is in addition to the employer's contribution rate and is not subject to the limiting provisions of section 19(a)(6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The solvency tax rate shall be determined as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If there is a balance on December 31, 2011, of unrepaid interest bearing federal advances, the solvency tax rate for the 2012 calendar year and for each calendar year thereafter shall be calculated in the manner provided in this subdivision until the balance of the interest bearing federal advances on December 31, 2011 has been reduced to zero. By February 1 of the calendar year, the commission shall calculate the sum of the estimated interest due during the calendar on federal loans, without regard to any interest deferral that is permitted under section 1202 of the social security act, 42 USC 1322, the remaining balance on December 31 of the preceding year of the December 31, 2011 balance of unrepaid interest bearing federal advances, and any amounts advanced from the state treasury under subsection (3) during the preceding year and any interest on the balance. For purposes of calculating the remaining balance, any loan repayments during the year shall first be applied toward reducing the December 31, 2011 loan balance. The amount so calculated shall be divided by the estimated total taxable payroll for the calendar year of all active employers who had negative balances in their experience accounts as of June 30 of the previous year. Total taxable payroll shall be estimated by using the total taxable payroll for those employers for the 12-month period ending June 30 of the previous calendar year and adjusting this figure for any change in the taxable wage limit for the calendar year. The quotient shall be adjusted to the next 1/10 of 1%. If this adjusted percentage is 0.8% or less, an employer's solvency tax rate for that calendar year shall be the percentage calculated. If the adjusted percentage is more than 0.8%, the employer's solvency tax rate shall be calculated in the same manner as the account building component of the employer's contribution rate as determined under section 19(a)(4), adjusted to generate sufficient aggregate solvency tax revenues to pay the interest due during the year on federal loans, to pay for the unemployment insurance automation project, to repay the remaining balance of the December 31, 2011 balance of unrepaid federal interest bearing loans, and to repay advances from the state treasury and any interest due thereon, but shall not exceed the lesser of 1/4 of the percentage calculated or 2%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For any calendar year after the first calendar year that the remaining balance of the December 31, 2011 balance of unrepaid interest bearing federal advances has been reduced to zero by December 31 of that year, an employer's solvency tax rate shall be calculated in the same manner as the account building component of the employer's contribution rate as determined under section 19(a)(4), but shall not exceed the lesser of 1/4 of the percentage calculated or 2%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Solvency taxes shall become due and payable in the manner, and at the times, specified for contributions in rules promulgated by the commission. However, if the state is permitted to defer interest payments due during a calendar year under section 1202(b)(3) or (8) of the social security act, 42 USC 1322, payment of the solvency tax may likewise be deferred by an employer and paid in installments in a manner prescribed by the commission. If a deferral of interest payment is subsequently disallowed by the United States department of labor, either prospectively or retroactively, amounts of solvency taxes deferred under this section shall become immediately due and payable. Further, if the commission estimates that the solvency taxes to be collected by September 30 of the calendar year will be insufficient to meet the interest obligations due during that calendar year, the percentages of amounts of solvency taxes deferred in any year shall be reduced by the commission in an amount sufficient to meet the interest obligations due in that calendar year. Furthermore, if the amount of solvency taxes to be collected by the time the federal interest obligations are due in any year are insufficient to meet the obligations when due, the commission shall recommend to the legislature that it appropriate an amount sufficient to meet the interest obligations due. Any amount so appropriated and used to pay federal interest obligations, and interest due on such state appropriation, if any, shall be repaid to the state as soon as possible from the solvency tax revenues in the contingent fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Amounts obtained pursuant to this section shall be paid into the contingent fund created under section 10 and, except for solvency taxes transferred to the unemployment compensation fund as provided in this subsection, shall not be credited to the employer's experience account. Amounts collected from solvency taxes which are transferred to the unemployment compensation fund and used to repay federal advances to the unemployment compensation fund shall be credited to the employers' experience accounts by June 30 of the year following the calendar year in which the transfer occurred. The amount to be credited to an employer's account shall be determined by the commission, but shall reasonably reflect each employer's pro rata share of the amount transferred. Past due payments of the solvency tax shall be subject to the interest, penalty, assessment, and collection provisions of section 15. Interest and penalties collected shall be paid into the contingent fund. Adjustments and refunds of erroneously collected solvency taxes shall be made in accordance with section 16. Solvency tax determinations are appealable under the appeal process provided for review and appeal of determinations under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If any provision of this section prevents the state from qualifying for any federal interest relief provisions provided under section 1202 of the social security act, 42 USC 1322, or prevents employers in this state from qualifying for the limitation on the reduction of federal unemployment tax act credits as provided under section 3302(f) of the federal unemployment tax act, 26 USC 3302(f), that provision is invalid to the extent necessary to maintain qualification for the interest relief provisions and federal unemployment tax credits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if interest due during a calendar year on federal advances is forgiven or postponed under federal law and is no longer due during that calendar year, no solvency tax shall be assessed against an employer for that calendar year and any solvency tax already assessed and collected against an employer before the forgiveness or postponement of the interest for that calendar year shall be credited to the employer's experience account.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The following apply to benefits paid:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Benefits paid must be charged against the employer's account as of the quarter in which the payments are made. If the unemployment agency determines that any benefits charged against an employer's account were improperly paid, an amount equal to the charge based on those benefits must be credited to the employer's account and a corresponding charge must be made to the nonchargeable benefits account as of the date of the charge. Recovery of benefits improperly paid to the claimant under this subdivision must be made pursuant to section 62(a).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If an employer or employer's agent has a pattern of failing to respond with timely or adequate information requested by the unemployment agency regarding a claimant's disqualification from receiving benefits or period of ineligibility, benefits paid to a claimant as a result of the employer's or employer's agent's failure to provide timely or adequate information must be charged to the employer's account and the employer's account must not be credited. To demonstrate a pattern sufficient to render the benefits chargeable, the number of failures, excluding failures for which an employer or employer's agent has established good cause, during the prior calendar year must be 5 or more and equal to or greater than 2% of all the requests directed to the employer during the prior calendar year. The unemployment agency shall make a determination for and assign a case number to each failure to provide a timely or adequate response. A determination made under this subdivision may be appealed within 30 days after the date it was issued, but an appeal is limited to the determination that the employer failed to provide a timely or adequate response in that instance. Each determination made under this subdivision must do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Identify and state why a response was not timely or not adequate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) State that the employer may appeal the determination within 30 days after the date it was issued.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) State the number of failures that constitute a pattern under this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) By January 11 each year, beginning in 2019, the unemployment agency shall send a determination to an employer or employer's agent that demonstrated during the previous calendar year a pattern of failing to respond timely or adequately under subdivision (2). A determination made under this subdivision is appealable in the same manner as any other determination made by the unemployment agency, but is limited to the determination that the employer demonstrated a pattern of failing to respond timely or adequately under subdivision (2). A determination made under this subdivision must include all of the following for each failure:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The name of the claimant and the last 4 digits of the claimant's social security number.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Whether the failure was because the response was not timely or not adequate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The date of the unemployment agency's original request for information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The case number the unemployment agency assigned to the failure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) A statement that the employer's account will not be credited for benefits paid on any claim filed during the current calendar year if the employer fails to timely or adequately respond to the unemployment agency's request for information made during the current calendar year regarding a claimant's disqualification from receiving benefits or period of ineligibility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) A statement that a determination made under this subdivision is appealable in the same manner as any other determination made by the unemployment agency. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For benefit years established on or after October 1, 2000, the claimant's full weekly benefit rate must be charged to the account or experience account of the claimant's most recent separating employer for each of the first 2 weeks of benefits payable to the claimant in the benefit year pursuant to the monetary determination issued under section 32. However, if the total sum of wages paid by an employer totals $200.00 or less, those wages must be used for purposes of benefit payment, but any benefit charges attributable to those wages must be charged to the nonchargeable benefits account. Thereafter, remaining weeks of benefits payable in the benefit year must be paid pursuant to the monetary determination and must be charged proportionally to all base period employers, with the charge to each base period employer being made on the basis of the ratio that total wages paid by the employer in the base period bears to total wages paid by all employers in the base period. However, if the claimant did not perform services for the most recent separating employer or employing entity and receive earnings for performing the services of at least 40 times the state minimum hourly wage times 7 during the claimant's most recent period of employment with the employer or employing entity, then all weeks of benefits payable in the benefit year must be charged proportionally to all base period employers, with the charge to each base period employer being made on the basis of the ratio that total wages paid by the employer in the base period bears to total wages paid by all employers in the base period. If the claimant performed services for the most recent separating employing entity and received earnings for performing the services of at least 40 times the state minimum hourly wage times 7 during the claimant's most recent period of employment for the employing entity but the separating employing entity was not a liable employer, the first 2 weeks of benefits payable to the claimant must be charged proportionally to all base period employers, with the charge to each base period employer made on the basis of the ratio that total wages paid by the employer in the base period bears to total wages paid by all employers in the base period. The "separating employer" is the employer that caused the individual to be unemployed as described in section 48.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For benefit years established before October 1, 2000, charges for regular benefits to reimbursing employers or to a contributing employer's experience account must be as formerly provided in this subsection. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) For benefit years beginning on or after October 1, 2000, and except as otherwise provided in section 11(d) or (g) or section 46, the charges for regular benefits to any reimbursing employer's account or to any contributing employer's experience account must not exceed either the amount derived by multiplying by 2 the weekly benefit rate chargeable to the employer under subsection (b) if the employer is the separating employer and is chargeable for the first 2 weeks of benefits, or the amount derived from the percentage of the weekly benefit rate chargeable to the employer under subsection (b), multiplied by the number of weeks of benefits chargeable to base period employers based on base period wages, to which the individual is entitled as provided in section 27(d), if the employer is a base period employer, or both of these amounts if the employer was both the chargeable separating employer and a base period employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) For benefit years beginning before October 1, 2000, benefits and charging for multiemployer credit weeks must be determined as formerly provided in this subsection. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) For benefit years beginning on or after October 1, 2000 and before January 1, 2014, if a base period contributing employer notifies the unemployment agency that it paid gross wages to a claimant in a week at least equal to the employer's benefit charge for that claimant for the week, then the unemployment agency shall issue a monetary redetermination noncharging the account of the employer for that week and for the remaining weeks of the benefit year for benefits payable to the claimant that would otherwise be charged to the employer's account. For benefit years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, benefits payable to an individual for a week and for each remaining payable week in the benefit year must be charged to the nonchargeable benefits account if either of the following occurs:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The individual reports gross earnings in the week with a contributing base period employer at least equal to the employer's benefit charges for that individual for the week.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A contributing base period employer timely protests a determination charging benefits to its account for a week in which the employer paid gross wages to an individual at least equal to the employer's charges for benefits paid to that individual for that week.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) For benefit years beginning before October 1, 2000, training benefits are determined as formerly provided in this subsection. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) For benefit years beginning on or after October 1, 2000:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Training benefits as provided in section 27(g), and extended benefits as provided in section 64, must be charged to each reimbursing employer in the base period of the claim to which the benefits are related, on the basis of the ratio that the total wages paid by a reimbursing employer during the base period bears to the total wages paid by all reimbursing employers in the base period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Training benefits, and extended benefits to the extent they are not reimbursable by the federal government and have been allocated to a reimbursing employer, must be charged to that reimbursing employer. A contributing employer's experience account must not be charged with training benefits. Training benefits based on service with a contributing employer, to the extent they are not reimbursable by the federal government, must be charged to the nonchargeable benefits account. Extended benefits paid and based on service with a contributing employer, to the extent they are not reimbursable by the federal government, must be charged to that employer's experience account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the training benefits or extended benefits are chargeable only to a single reimbursing employer, the benefits must be charged pursuant to subsection (a). If the training benefits or extended benefits are chargeable to more than 1 reimbursing employer, or to 1 or more reimbursing employers and the nonchargeable benefits account, the benefits must be charged as of the quarter in which the payments are made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Notice of charges made under this subsection must be given to each employer by means of a current listing of charges, at least weekly, and subsequently by a quarterly summary statement of charges. The listing shall specify the name and social security number of each claimant paid benefits in the week, the weeks for which the benefits were paid, and the amount of benefits chargeable to that employer paid for each week. The quarterly summary statement of charges shall list each claimant by name and social security number and shall show total benefit payments chargeable to that employer and made to each claimant during the calendar quarter. The listing is considered to satisfy the requirements of sections 21(a) and 32(f) that notification be given to each employer of benefits charged against that employer's account by means of a listing of the benefit payment. All protest and appeal rights applicable to benefit payment listings shall also apply to the notice of charges. If an employer receives both a current listing of charges and a quarterly summary statement of charges under this subsection, all protest and appeal rights apply only to the first notice given.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If a benefit year is established on or after October 1, 2000, the portion of benefits paid in that benefit year that are based on wages used to establish the immediately preceding benefit year that began before October 1, 2000 must not be charged to the employer or employers who paid those wages but must be charged instead to the nonchargeable benefits account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) For benefit years beginning after March 30, 2009, benefits paid to a person who leaves employment to accompany a spouse who is a full-time member of the United States Armed Forces and is reassigned for military service in a different geographic location are not chargeable to the employer, but must be charged to the nonchargeable benefits account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) As used in subsection (a):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) "Adequate" means that an employer or employer's agent answered each question of the unemployment agency's request for information, or provided an explanation as to why it did not answer a question, or provided a summary of the requested information to reasonably allow the unemployment agency to make its determination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) "Good cause" means any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The employer or employer's agent did not possess the information and could not reasonably obtain the information by the date requested by the unemployment agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Disclosing the information would endanger the health, morals, or safety of the employer or the employer's agent or employee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The employer or employer's agent presents a valid legal or evidentiary objection to the unemployment agency's request for information, as determined by the unemployment agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) "Timely" means that the unemployment agency received a response to its request for information from an employer or employer's agent not later than 10 calendar days, not including a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, after the mailing date or transmittal date of its request.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If an employer's account has been charged with any unemployment benefits attributable to CETA-PSE services paid for weeks of unemployment beginning January 4, 1976, through October 2, 1976, the employer shall receive a credit to its account equal to the amount of those benefits reimbursed to the commission under the emergency jobs programs extension act of 1976 (Public Law 94-444). With respect to a reimbursing employer, the credit may only be used as a credit against the future reimbursement liability of the employer or his total or partial transferee. With respect to a contributing employer, the credit may only be used as a credit to the employer's rating account.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A contributing employer shall receive a credit equal to the amount of contributions the employer paid, to the extent that the contributions were based on CETA-PSE wages paid from January 1, 1975, through October 2, 1976. The credit may only be used as a credit against the employer's future contribution liability.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   After October 2, 1976, an employer's account shall not be charged for benefits, based on CETA-PSE services, which are reimbursed to the commission under the emergency jobs programs extension act of 1976 (Public Law 94-444). Furthermore, a contributing employer shall not be liable for contributions on CETA-PSE wages paid after October 2, 1976. If a reimbursing employer's account has been charged for benefits or a contributing employer has made contributions based on CETA-PSE wages paid after October 2, 1976, the commission shall credit the employer's account in the same manner as provided in subsections (2) and (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   For the purposes of this section, a political subdivision of this state with its own unemployment compensation program under which unemployment benefits have been paid on the basis of CETA-PSE service in its employ, shall be entitled to cash reimbursement of those benefit costs to the extent that those benefit costs are reimbursed to the commission under the emergency jobs programs extension act of 1976 (Public Law 94-444). For purposes of obtaining the federal reimbursement, the commission shall act as agent for the political subdivision.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If an employer subject to this act transfers any of the assets of the business by any means otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade and there is not substantially common ownership, management, or control of the transferor and the transferee, the transfer shall be deemed a "transfer of business" for the purposes of this section if the commission determines both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) That the transferee is an employer subject to this act on the transfer date, has become subject to this act as of the transfer date under section 41(2)(a) or elects to become subject to this act as of the transfer date under section 25. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) That the transferee has acquired and used the transferor's trade name or good will, or that the transferee has continued or within 12 months after the transfer resumed all or part of the business of the transferor either in the same establishment or elsewhere.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), a transfer of assets to a transferee that involves less than 75% of the transferor's assets shall not be deemed a transfer of business unless all of the following occur:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The commission is notified of the transfer of assets by the transferor or transferee within 30 days after the end of the quarter in which the transfer occurred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The commission receives within 30 days after its request written approval by the transferor and transferee of an experience account transfer determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In the case of a transferee who elects under section 25 to become subject as of the transfer date, the commission receives the election within 30 days after the mailing of a notice of the right to elect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) (1) In the case of a transfer of business as defined in subsection (a) or (b), the commission shall assign the transferor's experience account, or a pro rata part of the account, to the transferee. The commission shall make the assignment as of the date on which the business is transferred or as of June 30 of the year in which the business was transferred, whichever date is earlier. The pro rata part of the transferor's experience account to be assigned to the transferee shall be determined on the basis of the percentage relationship to the nearest 1/2 of 1% that the insured payroll for the 4 completed calendar quarters immediately before the date of transfer properly allocable to the transferred portion of the business bears to the insured payroll for the same period allocable to the entire business of the transferor immediately before the date of the transfer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) When the commission transfers an employer's experience account in whole or in part under this section, it shall also transfer a proportionate share of the amount of the total wages and wages subject to contributions under this act paid by the transferor and properly allocable to the transfer of business; and the transferred account shall be chargeable for all benefit payments based on employment in the business or portion of the business transferred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In determining whether the transferee qualifies for a contribution rate that includes a chargeable benefits component under section 19, the experience of the transferred account shall be included as part of the experience of the transferee's experience account. If on the date of the transfer the transferee qualified for a contribution rate that includes a chargeable benefits component and the transferor did not qualify because of the provisions of section 19(a)(1), the transferee shall not thereby lose the qualified status. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) In the case of a transfer of business as defined in subsection (a) or (b) of this section, contribution rates are determined as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The rates of contributions applicable to the transferor and transferee for the calendar year after the calendar year of the transfer shall be respectively determined in accordance with section 19. In case of a transfer of part of an employer's experience account under subsection (c), the rate of contributions applicable to the transferor and transferee shall not be changed for the portion of the current calendar year remaining on the transfer date. In case of a transfer of an employer's entire experience account under subsection (c), all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The transferor shall have no further interest in the experience account. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The transferor's coverage shall be terminated as of the effective date of the transfer under section 24(b).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If the transferor again becomes an employer as defined in section 41 in the same calendar year in which coverage is terminated, the transferor's contribution rate for the remainder of the calendar year shall be 2.7% as provided in section 19. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The rate of contributions applicable to the transferee shall not be changed for the portion of the current calendar year remaining on the transfer date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A transferee that has no rate of contributions applicable immediately before the transfer date shall, beginning with the first day of the quarter in which the transfer occurs, be assigned the same rate of contributions that applied to the transferor on the date of the transfer and a contribution rate of 2.7% for any portion of the calendar year before the first day of the quarter in which the transfer occurs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If transfers of businesses simultaneously involve 2 or more transferors and a single transferee who has no rate of contributions applicable immediately before the transfer date, the transferee shall be assigned a contribution rate beginning with the first day of the quarter in which the transfers occur based upon the experience account percentage determined by the transferred experience account balances and the total and insured payrolls properly allocable to the transferee as of the date on which the businesses were transferred, or as of June 30 of the year in which the businesses were transferred, whichever is earlier, and a contribution rate of 2.7% for any portion of the calendar year before the first day of the quarter in which the transfers occur. If none of the transferors was an employer entitled to an adjusted contribution rate, then a contribution rate of 2.7% shall apply to the transferee for the calendar year in which the transfers occur.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>421.22b Transferring trade or business with intent to reduce contribution rate or reimbursement payments.</B><P>Sec. 22b.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A person shall not do either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Transfer the person's trade or business or a portion of the trade or business to another employer for the sole or primary purpose of reducing the contribution rate or reimbursement payments in lieu of contributions required under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Acquire a trade or business or a part of a trade or business for the sole or primary purpose of obtaining a lower contribution rate than would otherwise apply under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The following provisions apply to assignment of rates and transfer of the unemployment experience of a trade or business to prevent or remedy transfers of trade or business in violation of subsection (1):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If an employer transfers its trade or business or a portion of its trade or business to another employer and there is substantially common ownership, management, or control of the 2 employers at the time of the transfer, the unemployment experience attributable to the transferred trade or business shall be transferred to the transferee employer. The agency shall recalculate the contribution rates of both employers under section 19 and apply the new rates in the same manner as for a transfer of business under section 22(c)(1) and (d)(1). However, if, after a transfer of experience under this subdivision the agency determines that the sole or primary purpose of the transfer of trade or business was to obtain reduced liability for contributions, then the experience rating accounts of the employers involved shall be combined into a single account and a single rate assigned to the account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the unemployment insurance agency determines that a person who is not an employer under this act at the time of a transfer acquires a trade or business, or a portion of a trade or business, solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower contribution rate, the unemployment insurance agency shall assign that employer the applicable new employer rate under section 19.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) In addition to any sanction available under section 54(b) or 54b, if a person knowingly violates or attempts to violate subsection (1), or if a person knowingly advises another person so as to cause a violation of subsection (1), the person is subject to the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the person is a transferring or acquiring employer, the employer shall be assigned the higher of the following contribution rates:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) The highest contribution rate assignable under this act for the rate year during which the violation or attempted violation occurs and for the 3 rate years immediately following that rate year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) If the employer's business is already at the highest rate assignable for a year in which the violation occurs or if the highest rate assignable would result in an increase of less than 2% of taxable wages, an additional penalty rate of 2% of taxable wages for that year. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the person is not an employer, the person is subject to a civil fine of not more than $5,000.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Notwithstanding the restrictions in section 26(a), the money recovered under this section as contributions, reimbursements in lieu of contributions, civil fines, civil penalties, or interest shall be credited to the unemployment compensation fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The unemployment insurance agency shall establish procedures to identify the transfer or acquisition of a trade or business, or part of a trade or business, for purposes of this section. This subdivision does not grant authority to promulgate rules to define SUTA dumping.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Beginning January 1, 2006, the unemployment insurance agency shall provide an annual written report to the chairpersons of the standing committees and the appropriations subcommittees of the house and senate having jurisdiction over legislation pertaining to unemployment compensation. The report shall include all of the following information in a form that does not identify individual employers:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The procedures the agency has adopted to prevent SUTA dumping.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The number of SUTA dumping investigations opened during the year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The average length of time to resolve a SUTA dumping investigation and the number of investigations pending for more than 6 months and for more than 1 year. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The number of cases brought before an administrative law judge or the board of review and the agency's success rate in those cases. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) The amount of money recovered as a result of implementing the provisions of this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) The amount of the balance or deficit in the unemployment compensation fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vii) The estimated fiscal impact of SUTA dumping on the unemployment compensation fund balance and the factual basis for the estimate. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(viii) The number of full-time employees assigned to, and the number of employee hours devoted to, SUTA dumping prevention, investigation, and remediation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ix) The number of SUTA dumping investigations that involved the transfer of employees to or from an employee leasing company.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(x) The number of investigations in which an employee leasing company was found to have participated in SUTA dumping.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(xi) The number of employee leasing companies operating in Michigan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For purposes of this section, the unemployment insurance agency shall determine whether a transfer is made for the sole or primary purpose of obtaining a lower contribution rate using objective factors, such as the cost of acquiring the business, continuity in operating the business enterprise of the acquired business, the length of time the business enterprise continues to operate, and the number of new employees hired to perform duties unrelated to the business activity or trade conducted before the acquisition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the following provisions apply to changes in status between reimbursing employer and contributing employer:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If a contributing employer, including an employer described in section 13l that elected to be a contributing employer, elects to become a reimbursing employer, any negative balance the employer incurred while a contributing employer must be paid to the agency before the employer may become a reimbursing employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Any benefit charges incurred as a result of services performed for a contributing employer that are charged to the employer's account after it has become a reimbursing employer shall be transferred to the employer's reimbursing account and paid by means of reimbursement to the agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If a reimbursing employer or an employer described in section 13l of this act applies to become a contributing employer and the agency permits the reimbursing employer to become a contributing employer, or if the agency converts a reimbursing employer to a contributing employer, then the employer shall continue to pay the agency as reimbursement payments those benefit charges that were incurred based on wages paid while the employer was a reimbursing employer, and benefit charges incurred based on wages paid after the reimbursing employer became a contributing employer shall be used to calculate the employer's contribution rate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Knowingly" means having actual knowledge of, or acting with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard for, the prohibition involved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Person" means that term as defined in section 7701 of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 7701.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "SUTA" means state unemployment tax act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "SUTA dumping" means transferring a trade or business, or a part of a trade or business, solely or primarily for the purpose of reducing the contribution rate or reimbursement payments in lieu of contributions required under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) "Trade or business" includes the employer's employees, but the transfer of some or all of an employer's employees to another employer shall be considered a transfer of trade or business for purposes of this section if, as a result of the transfer, the transferring employer no longer performs trade or business with respect to the transferred employees and that trade or business is performed by the transferee employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) This section is intended to be interpreted and applied in a manner so as to meet the minimum requirements of the SUTA dumping prevention act of 2004, Public Law 108-295, and implementing federal regulations.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Except as otherwise provided in section 25, an employing unit shall cease to be an employer subject to this act as provided in this section:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If an employing unit that became liable under section 41 makes written application for termination of its coverage under this act, the commission shall issue a determination granting or denying the application. The commission shall grant the application terminating coverage effective as of the last day of the calendar quarter in which the application was received by the commission if it finds that the employing unit did not meet the applicable requirements of an employer specified in section 41 during the preceding calendar year and during the current calendar year, up to the last day of the calendar quarter in which the application was received. If the employing unit requesting termination became an employer under section 41(2) in the preceding calendar year, then the individuals in the employ of any predecessor or predecessors in a chain of successorship shall be considered as if they were employees of the requesting employing unit for the purpose of determining the number of weeks during which 1 or more individuals performed services in employment and in determining total remuneration for employment during the preceding calendar year. If an employing unit liable solely under section 41(7) makes written application for termination of its coverage under this act, the commission shall grant the application terminating coverage effective as of the last day of the calendar quarter in which the application was received by the commission if it finds that the employing unit ceased to have employment in Michigan during the calendar year preceding the receipt of the application for termination and had no employment in Michigan during the current calendar year, up to the last day of the calendar quarter in which the application was received. An employer whose application for termination of coverage is denied may request a redetermination in accordance with section 32a.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The commission shall terminate the coverage of an employing unit as of the effective date on which the employing unit's entire rating account is transferred to another employer under section 22.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)(1)   The commission may issue a determination terminating the coverage of an employing unit as of January 1 of a calendar year if it finds that the employing unit ceased to exist during the preceding calendar year or met the requirements for termination as specified in subdivision (a). The determination shall be mailed by first-class mail to the last known address of the employing unit involved.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The commission may terminate the coverage of an employing unit as of January 1 of a previous calendar year with respect to which it makes the foregoing findings, if the employing unit has not been previously determined to have been an employer with respect to that specific year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The commission shall rescind its determination terminating the coverage of an employing unit under this subsection if it has received written objection to the determination from the employing unit within 30 days after the date of mailing by the commission.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) There is established as a special fund, separate and apart from all public money or funds of this state, an unemployment compensation fund, herein referred to as the fund, which shall be administered by the commission exclusively for the purposes of this act. The fund shall consist of (1) all contributions and payments in lieu of contributions collected under the provisions of this act as well as reimbursement payments by the federal government for its portion of sharable extended benefits; (2) interest earned upon any moneys in the fund; (3) any property or securities acquired through the use of money belonging to the fund; (4) all earnings of such property or securities; (5) amounts transferred from the contingent fund pursuant to section 10; (6) all money collected, including fines, civil penalties, and interest, under section 22b; (7) amounts credited to the fund under section 54; and (8) any other money received by the commission for unemployment compensation, except interest, penalties, and damages collected under other provisions of this act. All money in the fund shall be mingled and undivided.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The commission shall designate a treasurer and custodian of the fund who shall administer the fund in accordance with the directions of the commission and shall issue his or her vouchers upon it in accordance with the regulations as the commission prescribes. The treasurer shall maintain within the fund 3 separate accounts: (1) a clearing account, (2) an unemployment trust fund account, and (3) a benefit account. All money payable to the fund, upon receipt by the commission, shall be forwarded to the treasurer who shall immediately deposit it in the clearing account. Refunds payable pursuant to section 16 may be paid from the clearing account upon vouchers issued by the treasurer under the direction of the commission. After clearance of the vouchers, all other money in the clearing account, except amounts needed for refunds and judgments, shall be immediately deposited with the secretary of the treasury of the United States of America to the credit of the account of this state in the unemployment trust fund, established and maintained pursuant to section 904 of the social security act, 42 USC 1104. The benefit account shall consist of all money requisitioned from this state's account in the unemployment trust fund. Except as otherwise provided in this act, money in the clearing and benefit accounts may be deposited by the treasurer, under the direction of the commission, in any depository designated by the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, money shall be requisitioned from this state's account in the unemployment trust fund solely for the payment of benefits and in accordance with regulations prescribed by the commission. The commission shall from time to time requisition from the unemployment trust fund such amounts, not exceeding the amounts standing to its account in that fund, as it deems necessary for the payment of benefits for a reasonable future period. Upon receipt, the treasurer shall deposit the requisitioned money in the benefit account and shall issue his or her vouchers for the payment of benefits solely from the benefit account. All vouchers issued by the treasurer for the payment of benefits and refunds shall bear the signature of the treasurer and the counter-signature of a member of the commission or its duly authorized agent for that purpose. Any balance of money requisitioned from the unemployment trust fund which remains unclaimed or unpaid in the benefit account after the expiration of the period for which the sums were requisitioned shall either be deducted from estimates for, and may be utilized for the payment of, benefits during succeeding periods, or, in the discretion of the commission, shall be redeposited with the secretary of the treasury of the United States of America, to the credit of this state's account in the unemployment trust fund, as provided in subsection (b). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The commission may requisition from this state's account in the unemployment trust fund such amounts, or portions thereof, as have been specifically appropriated by the legislature for the administration of this act in accordance with the provisions of section 903(c)(2) of the federal social security act, 42 USC 1103(c)(2). Upon receipt, the treasurer shall deposit that money in the administration fund, but it shall remain a part of the unemployment compensation fund until expended.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The provisions of subsections (a), (b), and (c), to the extent that they relate to the unemployment trust fund, shall be operative only while the unemployment trust fund continues to exist and until the secretary of the treasury of the United States of America continues to maintain for this state a separate account of all funds deposited in it by this state for benefit purposes, together with this state's proportionate share of the earnings of the unemployment trust fund, from which no other state is permitted to make withdrawals. If the unemployment trust fund ceases to exist, or the separate account is no longer maintained, all money, properties, or securities therein, belonging to the unemployment compensation fund of this state, shall be transferred to the treasurer of the unemployment compensation fund, who shall hold, invest, transfer, sell, deposit, and release the money, properties, or securities in a manner approved by the commission, in bonds or other interest bearing obligations of the United States of America or of this state. The investments shall be so made that all the assets of the fund are readily convertible into cash when needed for the payment of benefits. The treasurer shall dispose of securities or other properties belonging to the unemployment compensation fund only under the direction of the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The unemployment compensation fund shall be audited by the auditor general at the times requested by the state administrative board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The commission may designate an assistant treasurer who, in the absence of the treasurer and custodian as designated by the commission under the authority conferred upon it under subsection (b), may perform the duties conferred upon the treasurer and custodian under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The commission may enter into agreements that are necessary to secure any advance or grant of funds by the secretary of the treasury of the United States in accordance with the authority extended under section 1201 of the social security act, 42 USC 1321, or under any other act of congress extending that authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Any amount transferred to the unemployment trust fund by the secretary of the treasury of the United States under the terms of any agreement entered into in accordance with the authority extended in this subsection shall be repaid to the secretary of the treasury of the United States for the unemployment trust fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Whenever all interest bearing advances from the federal government have been repaid, if employers will be able to avoid, under the provisions of section 3302(g) of the federal unemployment tax act, 26 USC 3302(g), direct payment of the additional federal unemployment tax imposed under section 3302(c)(2) of the federal unemployment tax act, 26 USC 3302(c)(2), funds sufficient to qualify for avoidance shall be transferred from the account of this state in the federal unemployment trust fund to the federal unemployment account in that trust fund, unless precluded by federal law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Any interest required to be paid on advances under title XII of the social security act, 42 USC 1321 to 1324, shall be paid in a timely manner and shall not be paid, directly or indirectly by an equivalent reduction in contributions or payments in lieu of contributions, from amounts in this state's account in the federal unemployment trust fund.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) To fund capitalized interest; debt service reserve funds; and payment of costs of, and administrative expenses in connection with, issuing obligations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In 2011 and in each year thereafter in which any obligation is outstanding, an employer is subject to, shall be assessed, and shall pay an unemployment obligation assessment, which shall be collected quarterly and shall be deposited to the credit of the obligation trust fund. The obligation assessment is in addition to the employer's required contributions, is not subject to the limiting provisions for contributions required under this act, and is in addition to and separate from the solvency tax imposed under section 19a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The unemployment obligation assessment rate shall be determined by the state treasurer after consultation with the director of the department of licensing and regulatory affairs and shall be an amount sufficient to ensure timely payment of all of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a)(1) When a determination, redetermination, or decision is made that benefits are due an unemployed individual, the benefits become payable from the fund and continue to be payable to the unemployed individual, subject to the limitations imposed by the individual's monetary entitlement, if the individual continues to be unemployed and to file claims for benefits, until the determination, redetermination, or decision is reversed, a determination, redetermination, or decision on a new issue holding the individual disqualified or ineligible is made, or, for benefit years beginning before October 1, 2000, a new separation issue arises resulting from subsequent work.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Benefits are payable in person or by mail through employment security offices in accordance with rules promulgated by the unemployment agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b)(1) Subject to subsection (f), the weekly benefit rate for an individual, with respect to benefit years beginning before October 1, 2000, is 67% of the individual's average after tax weekly wage, except that the individual's maximum weekly benefit rate must not exceed $300.00. However, with respect to benefit years beginning on or after October 1, 2000, the individual's weekly benefit rate is 4.1% of the individual's wages paid in the calendar quarter of the base period in which the individual was paid the highest total wages, plus $6.00 for each dependent as defined in subdivision (4), up to a maximum of 5 dependents, claimed by the individual at the time the individual files a new claim for benefits, except that the individual's maximum weekly benefit rate must not exceed $300.00 before April 26, 2002 and $362.00 for claims filed on and after April 26, 2002. The weekly benefit rate for an individual claiming benefits on and after April 26, 2002 must be recalculated subject to the $362.00 maximum weekly benefit rate. The unemployment agency shall establish the procedures necessary to verify the number of dependents claimed. If a person fraudulently claims a dependent, that person is subject to the penalties set forth in sections 54 and 54c. For benefit years beginning on or after October 2, 1983, the weekly benefit rate must be adjusted to the next lower multiple of $1.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) For benefit years beginning before October 1, 2000, the state average weekly wage for a calendar year is computed on the basis of the 12 months ending the June 30 immediately before that calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For benefit years beginning before October 1, 2000, a dependent means any of the following persons who are receiving and for at least 90 consecutive days immediately before the week for which benefits are claimed, or, in the case of a dependent husband, wife, or child, for the duration of the marital or parental relationship, if the relationship has existed less than 90 days, has received more than 1/2 the cost of his or her support from the individual claiming benefits:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A child, including stepchild, adopted child, or grandchild of the individual who is under 18 years of age, or 18 years of age or over if, because of physical or mental infirmity, the child is unable to engage in a gainful occupation, or is a full-time student as defined by the particular educational institution, at a high school, vocational school, community or junior college, or college or university and has not attained the age of 22.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The husband or wife of the individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The legal father or mother of the individual if that parent is either more than 65 years of age or is permanently disabled from engaging in a gainful occupation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A brother or sister of the individual if the brother or sister is orphaned or the living parents are dependent parents of an individual, and the brother or sister is under 18 years of age, or 18 years of age or over if, because of physical or mental infirmity, the brother or sister is unable to engage in a gainful occupation, or is a full-time student as defined by the particular educational institution, at a high school, vocational school, community or junior college, or college or university and is less than 22 years of age.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) For benefit years beginning on or after October 1, 2000, a dependent means any of the following persons who received for at least 90 consecutive days immediately before the first week of the benefit year or, in the case of a dependent husband, wife, or child, for the duration of the marital or parental relationship if the relationship existed less than 90 days before the beginning of the benefit year, has received more than 1/2 the cost of his or her support from the individual claiming the benefits:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A child, including stepchild, adopted child, or grandchild of the individual who is under 18 years of age, or 18 years of age and over if, because of physical or mental infirmity, the child is unable to engage in a gainful occupation, or is a full-time student as defined by the particular educational institution, at a high school, vocational school, community or junior college, or college or university and has not attained the age of 22.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The husband or wife of the individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The legal father or mother of the individual if that parent is either more than 65 years of age or is permanently disabled from engaging in a gainful occupation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A brother or sister of the individual if the brother or sister is orphaned or the living parents are dependent parents of an individual, and the brother or sister is under 18 years of age, or 18 years of age and over if, because of physical or mental infirmity, the brother or sister is unable to engage in a gainful occupation, or is a full-time student as defined by the particular educational institution, at a high school, vocational school, community or junior college, or college or university and is less than 22 years of age.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The number of dependents established for an individual at the beginning of the benefit year shall remain in effect during the entire benefit year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Dependency status of a dependent, child or otherwise, once established or fixed in favor of a person is not transferable to or usable by another person with respect to the same week.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Failure on the part of an individual, due to misinformation or lack of information, to furnish all information material for determination of the number of the individual's dependents is good cause to issue a redetermination as to the amount of benefits based on the number of the individual's dependents as of the beginning of the benefit year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Subject to subsection (f), all of the following apply to eligible individuals:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Each eligible individual must be paid a weekly benefit rate with respect to the week for which the individual earns or receives no remuneration. Notwithstanding the definition of week in section 50, if within 2 consecutive weeks in which an individual was not unemployed within the meaning of section 48 there was a period of 7 or more consecutive days for which the individual did not earn or receive remuneration, that period is considered a week for benefit purposes under this act if a claim for benefits for that period is filed not later than 30 days after the end of the period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The weekly benefit rate is reduced with respect to each week in which the eligible individual earns or receives remuneration at the rate of 40 cents for each whole $1.00 of remuneration earned or received during that week. Beginning October 1, 2015, an eligible individual's weekly benefit rate is reduced at the rate of 50 cents for each whole $1.00 of remuneration in which the eligible individual earns or receives remuneration in that benefit week. The weekly benefit rate is not reduced under this subdivision for remuneration received for on-call or training services as a volunteer firefighter, if the volunteer firefighter receives less than $10,000.00 in a calendar year for services as a volunteer firefighter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An individual who receives or earns partial remuneration may not receive a total of benefits and earnings that exceeds 1-3/5 times his or her weekly benefit amount. For each dollar of total benefits and earnings that exceeds 1-3/5 times the individual's weekly benefit amount, benefits are reduced by $1.00. Beginning October 1, 2015, the total benefits and earnings for an individual who receives or earns partial remuneration may not exceed 1-1/2 times his or her weekly benefit amount. The individual's benefits are reduced by $1.00 for each dollar by which the total benefits and earnings exceed 1-1/2 times the individual's weekly benefit amount.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the reduction in a claimant's benefit rate for a week in accordance with subdivision (2) or (3) results in a benefit rate greater than zero for that week, the claimant's balance of weeks of benefit payments is reduced by 1 week.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) All remuneration for work performed during a shift that terminates on 1 day but that began on the preceding day is considered to have been earned by the eligible individual on the preceding day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The unemployment agency shall report annually to the legislature the following information with regard to subdivisions (2) and (3):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The number of individuals whose weekly benefit rate was reduced at the rate of 40 or 50 cents for each whole $1.00 of remuneration earned or received over the immediately preceding calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The number of individuals who received or earned partial remuneration at or exceeding the applicable limit of 1-1/2 or 1-3/5 times their weekly benefit amount prescribed in subdivision (3) for any 1 or more weeks during the immediately preceding calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The unemployment agency shall not use prorated quarterly wages to establish a reduction in benefits under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Subject to subsection (f) and this subsection, the maximum benefit amount payable to an individual in a benefit year for purposes of this section and section 20(d) is the number of weeks of benefits payable to an individual during the benefit year, multiplied by the individual's weekly benefit rate. The number of weeks of benefits payable to an individual shall be calculated by taking 43% of the individual's base period wages and dividing the result by the individual's weekly benefit rate. If the quotient is not a whole or half number, the result is rounded down to the nearest half number. However, for each eligible individual filing an initial claim before January 15, 2012, not more than 26 weeks of benefits or less than 14 weeks of benefits are payable to an individual in a benefit year. For each eligible individual filing an initial claim on or after January 15, 2012, not more than 20 weeks of benefits or less than 14 weeks of benefits are payable to an individual in a benefit year. The limitation of total benefits set forth in this subsection does not apply to claimants declared eligible for training benefits in accordance with subsection (g). Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, and subject to subsection (q), with respect to benefit years and claims for weeks beginning before April 1, 2021, for each eligible individual who files a claim for benefits and establishes a benefit year, not more than 26 weeks of benefits or less than 14 weeks of benefits may be payable to an individual in a benefit year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) When a claimant dies or is judicially declared insane or mentally incompetent, unemployment compensation benefits accrued and payable to that person for weeks of unemployment before death, insanity, or incompetency, but not paid, become due and payable to the person who is the legal heir or guardian of the claimant or to any other person found by the commission to be equitably entitled to the benefits by reason of having incurred expense in behalf of the claimant for the claimant's burial or other necessary expenses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f)(1) For benefit years beginning before October 1, 2000, and notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of this act, the weekly benefit rate of each individual who is receiving or will receive a "retirement benefit", as defined in subdivision (4), is adjusted as provided in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c). However, an individual's extended benefit account and an individual's weekly extended benefit rate under section 64 is established without reduction under this subsection unless subdivision (5) is in effect. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, all other provisions of this act continue to apply in connection with the benefit claims of those retired persons.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If and to the extent that unemployment benefits payable under this act would be chargeable to an employer who has contributed to the financing of a retirement plan under which the claimant is receiving or will receive a retirement benefit yielding a pro rata weekly amount equal to or larger than the claimant's weekly benefit rate as otherwise established under this act, the claimant must not receive unemployment benefits that would be chargeable to the employer under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If and to the extent that unemployment benefits payable under this act would be chargeable to an employer who has contributed to the financing of a retirement plan under which the claimant is receiving or will receive a retirement benefit yielding a pro rata weekly amount less than the claimant's weekly benefit rate as otherwise established under this act, then the weekly benefit rate otherwise payable to the claimant and chargeable to the employer under this act is reduced by an amount equal to the pro rata weekly amount, adjusted to the next lower multiple of $1.00, which the claimant is receiving or will receive as a retirement benefit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the unemployment benefit payable under this act would be chargeable to an employer who has not contributed to the financing of a retirement plan under which the claimant is receiving or will receive a retirement benefit, then the weekly benefit rate of the claimant as otherwise established under this act is not reduced due to receipt of a retirement benefit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If the unemployment benefit payable under this act is computed on the basis of multiemployer credit weeks and a portion of the benefit is allocable under section 20(e) to an employer who has contributed to the financing of a retirement plan under which the claimant is receiving or will receive a retirement benefit, the adjustments required by subparagraph (a) or (b) apply only to that portion of the weekly benefit rate that would otherwise be allocable and chargeable to the employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If an individual's weekly benefit rate under this act was established before the period for which the individual first receives a retirement benefit, any benefits received after a retirement benefit becomes payable must be determined in accordance with the formula stated in this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) When necessary to assure prompt payment of benefits, the commission shall determine the pro rata weekly amount yielded by an individual's retirement benefit based on the best information currently available to it. In the absence of fraud, a determination must not be reconsidered unless it is established that the individual's actual retirement benefit in fact differs from the amount determined by $2.00 or more per week. The reconsideration applies only to benefits that may be claimed after the information on which the reconsideration is based was received by the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4)(a) As used in this subsection, "retirement benefit" means a benefit, annuity, or pension of any type or that part thereof that is described in subparagraph (b) that is both:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Provided as an incident of employment under an established retirement plan, policy, or agreement, including federal Social Security if subdivision (5) is in effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Payable to an individual because the individual has qualified on the basis of attained age, length of service, or disability, whether or not the individual retired or was retired from employment. Amounts paid to individuals in the course of liquidation of a private pension or retirement fund because of termination of the business or of a plant or department of the business of the employer involved are not retirement benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If a benefit as described in subparagraph (a) is payable or paid to the individual under a plan to which the individual has contributed:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Less than 1/2 of the cost of the benefit, then only 1/2 of the benefit is treated as a retirement benefit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) One-half or more of the cost of the benefit, then none of the benefit is treated as a retirement benefit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The burden of establishing the extent of an individual's contribution to the cost of his or her retirement benefit for the purpose of subparagraph (b) is upon the employer who has contributed to the plan under which a benefit is provided.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, for any week that begins after March 31, 1980, and with respect to which an individual is receiving a governmental or other pension and claiming unemployment compensation, the weekly benefit amount payable to the individual for those weeks is reduced, but not below zero, by the entire prorated weekly amount of any governmental or other pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or any other similar payment that is based on any previous work of the individual. This reduction is made only if it is required as a condition for full tax credit against the tax imposed by the federal unemployment tax act, 26 USC 3301 to 3311.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For benefit years beginning on or after October 1, 2000, notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of this act, the weekly benefit rate of each individual who is receiving or will receive a retirement benefit, as defined in subdivision (4), is adjusted as provided in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c). However, an individual's extended benefit account and an individual's weekly extended benefit rate under section 64 is established without reduction under this subsection, unless subdivision (5) is in effect. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, all the other provisions of this act apply to the benefit claims of those retired persons. However, if the reduction would impair the full tax credit against the tax imposed by the federal unemployment tax act, 26 USC 3301 to 3311, unemployment benefits are not reduced as provided in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) for receipt of any governmental or other pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other similar payment that was not includable in the gross income of the individual for the taxable year in which it was received because it was a part of a rollover distribution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If any base period or chargeable employer has contributed to the financing of a retirement plan under which the claimant is receiving or will receive a retirement benefit yielding a pro rata weekly amount equal to or larger than the claimant's weekly benefit rate as otherwise established under this act, the claimant is not eligible to receive unemployment benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If any base period employer or chargeable employer has contributed to the financing of a retirement plan under which the claimant is receiving or will receive a retirement benefit yielding a pro rata weekly amount less than the claimant's weekly benefit rate as otherwise established under this act, then the weekly benefit rate otherwise payable to the claimant is reduced by an amount equal to the pro rata weekly amount, adjusted to the next lower multiple of $1.00, which the claimant is receiving or will receive as a retirement benefit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If no base period or separating employer has contributed to the financing of a retirement plan under which the claimant is receiving or will receive a retirement benefit, then the weekly benefit rate of the claimant as otherwise established under this act shall not be reduced due to receipt of a retirement benefit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, an individual pursuing vocational training or retraining pursuant to section 28(2) who has exhausted all benefits available under subsection (d) may be paid for each week of approved vocational training pursued beyond the date of exhaustion a benefit amount in accordance with subsection (c), but not in excess of the individual's most recent weekly benefit rate. However, an individual must not be paid training benefits totaling more than 18 times the individual's most recent weekly benefit rate. The expiration or termination of a benefit year does not stop or interrupt payment of training benefits if the training for which the benefits were granted began before expiration or termination of the benefit year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) A payment of accrued unemployment benefits is not payable to an eligible individual or in behalf of that individual as provided in subsection (e) more than 6 years after the ending date of the benefit year covering the payment or 2 calendar years after the calendar year in which there is final disposition of a contested case, whichever is later.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Benefits based on service in employment described in section 42(8), (9), and (10) are payable in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions as compensation payable on the basis of other service subject to this act, except that:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) With respect to service performed in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity for an institution of higher education as defined in section 53(2), or for an educational institution other than an institution of higher education as defined in section 53(3), benefits are not payable to an individual based on those services for any week of unemployment beginning after December 31, 1977 that commences during the period between 2 successive academic years or during a similar period between 2 regular terms, whether or not successive, or during a period of paid sabbatical leave provided for in the individual's contract, to an individual if the individual performs the service in the first of the academic years or terms and if there is a contract or a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform service in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity for an institution of higher education or an educational institution other than an institution of higher education in the second of the academic years or terms, whether or not the terms are successive.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) With respect to service performed in other than an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity for an institution of higher education as defined in section 53(2) or for an educational institution other than an institution of higher education as defined in section 53(3), benefits are not payable based on those services for any week of unemployment beginning after December 31, 1977 that commences during the period between 2 successive academic years or terms to any individual if that individual performs the service in the first of the academic years or terms and if there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform the service for an institution of higher education or an educational institution other than an institution of higher education in the second of the academic years or terms.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) With respect to any service described in subdivision (1) or (2), benefits are not payable to an individual based upon service for any week of unemployment that commences during an established and customary vacation period or holiday recess if the individual performs the service in the period immediately before the vacation period or holiday recess and there is a contract or reasonable assurance that the individual will perform the service in the period immediately following the vacation period or holiday recess.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If benefits are denied to an individual for any week solely as a result of subdivision (2) and the individual was not offered an opportunity to perform in the second academic year or term the service for which reasonable assurance had been given, the individual is entitled to a retroactive payment of benefits for each week for which the individual had previously filed a timely claim for benefits. An individual entitled to benefits under this subdivision may apply for those benefits by mail in accordance with R 421.210 of the Michigan Administrative Code as promulgated by the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Benefits based upon services in other than an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity for an institution of higher education are not denied for any week of unemployment commencing during the period between 2 successive academic years or terms solely because the individual had performed the service in the first of the academic years or terms and there is reasonable assurance that the individual will perform the service for an institution of higher education or an educational institution other than an institution of higher education in the second of the academic years or terms, unless a denial is required as a condition for full tax credit against the tax imposed by the federal unemployment tax act, 26 USC 3301 to 3311.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For benefit years established before October 1, 2000, and notwithstanding subdivisions (1), (2), and (3), the denial of benefits does not prevent an individual from completing requalifying weeks in accordance with section 29(3) nor does the denial prevent an individual from receiving benefits based on service with an employer other than an educational institution for any week of unemployment occurring between academic years or terms, whether or not successive, or during an established and customary vacation period or holiday recess, even though the employer is not the most recent chargeable employer in the individual's base period. However, in that case section 20(b) applies to the sequence of benefit charging, except for the employment with the educational institution, and section 50(b) applies to the calculation of credit weeks. When a denial of benefits under subdivision (1) no longer applies, benefits are charged in accordance with the normal sequence of charging as provided in section 20(b).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For benefit years beginning on or after October 1, 2000, and notwithstanding subdivisions (1), (2), and (3), the denial of benefits does not prevent an individual from completing requalifying weeks in accordance with section 29(3) and does not prevent an individual from receiving benefits based on service with another base period employer other than an educational institution for any week of unemployment occurring between academic years or terms, whether or not successive, or during an established and customary vacation period or holiday recess. However, if benefits are paid based on service with 1 or more base period employers other than an educational institution, the individual's weekly benefit rate is calculated in accordance with subsection (b)(1) but during the denial period the individual's weekly benefit payment is reduced by the portion of the payment attributable to base period wages paid by an educational institution and the account or experience account of the educational institution is not charged for benefits payable to the individual. When a denial of benefits under subdivision (1) is no longer applicable, benefits are paid and charged on the basis of base period wages with each of the base period employers including the educational institution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) For the purposes of this subsection, "academic year" means that period, as defined by the educational institution, when classes are in session for that length of time required for students to receive sufficient instruction or earn sufficient credit to complete academic requirements for a particular grade level or to complete instruction in a noncredit course.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) In accordance with subdivisions (1), (2), and (3), benefits for any week of unemployment are denied to an individual who performed services described in subdivision (1), (2), or (3) in an educational institution while in the employ of an educational service agency. For the purpose of this subdivision, "educational service agency" means a governmental agency or governmental entity that is established and operated exclusively for the purpose of providing the services to 1 or more educational institutions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Benefits are not payable to an individual on the basis of any base period services, substantially all of which consist of participating in sports or athletic events or training or preparing to participate, for a week that commences during the period between 2 successive sport seasons or similar periods if the individual performed the services in the first of the seasons or similar periods and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform the services in the later of the seasons or similar periods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k)(1) Benefits are not payable on the basis of services performed by an alien unless the alien is an individual who was lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time the services were performed, was lawfully present for the purpose of performing the services, or was permanently residing in the United States under color of law at the time the services were performed, including an alien who was lawfully present in the United States under section 212(d)(5) of the immigration and nationality act, 8 USC 1182.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Any data or information required of individuals applying for benefits to determine whether benefits are payable because of their alien status are uniformly required from all applicants for benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If an individual's application for benefits would otherwise be approved, a determination that benefits to that individual are not payable because of the individual's alien status must not be made except upon a preponderance of the evidence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m)(1) An individual filing a new claim for unemployment compensation under this act, at the time of filing the claim, shall disclose whether the individual owes child support obligations as defined in this subsection. If an individual discloses that he or she owes child support obligations and is determined to be eligible for unemployment compensation, the unemployment agency shall notify the state or local child support enforcement agency enforcing the obligation that the individual has been determined to be eligible for unemployment compensation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Notwithstanding section 30, the unemployment agency shall deduct and withhold from any unemployment compensation payable to an individual who owes child support obligations by using whichever of the following methods results in the greatest amount:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The amount, if any, specified by the individual to be deducted and withheld under this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The amount, if any, determined pursuant to an agreement submitted to the commission under 42 USC 654(19)(B)(i), by the state or local child support enforcement agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Any amount otherwise required to be deducted and withheld from unemployment compensation by legal process, as that term is defined in 42 USC 659(i)(5), properly served upon the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The amount of unemployment compensation subject to deduction under subdivision (2) is that portion that remains payable to the individual after application of the recoupment provisions of section 62(a) and the reduction provisions of subsections (c) and (f).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The unemployment agency shall pay any amount deducted and withheld under subdivision (2) to the appropriate state or local child support enforcement agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Any amount deducted and withheld under subdivision (2) is treated for all purposes as if it were paid to the individual as unemployment compensation and paid by the individual to the state or local child support enforcement agency in satisfaction of the individual's child support obligations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Provisions concerning deductions under this subsection apply only if the state or local child support enforcement agency agrees in writing to reimburse and does reimburse the unemployment agency for the administrative costs incurred by the unemployment agency under this subsection that are attributable to child support obligations being enforced by the state or local child support enforcement agency. The administrative costs incurred are determined by the unemployment agency. The unemployment agency, in its discretion, may require payment of administrative costs in advance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) As used in this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Unemployment compensation", for purposes of subdivisions (1) to (5), means any compensation payable under this act, including amounts payable by the unemployment agency pursuant to an agreement under any federal law providing for compensation, assistance, or allowances with respect to unemployment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Child support obligations" includes only obligations that are being enforced pursuant to a plan described in 42 USC 654 that has been approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under 42 USC 651 to 669b.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "State or local child support enforcement agency" means any agency of this state or a political subdivision of this state operating pursuant to a plan described in subparagraph (b).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) Subsection (i)(2) applies to services performed by school bus drivers employed by a private contributing employer holding a contractual relationship with an educational institution, but only if at least 75% of the individual's base period wages with that employer are attributable to services performed as a school bus driver. Subsection (i)(1) and (2) but not subsection (i)(3) applies to other services described in those subdivisions that are performed by any employees under an employer's contract with an educational institution or an educational service agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(o)(1) For weeks of unemployment beginning after July 1, 1996, unemployment benefits based on services by a seasonal worker performed in seasonal employment are payable only for weeks of unemployment that occur during the normal seasonal work period. Benefits are not payable based on services performed in seasonal employment for any week of unemployment beginning after March 28, 1996 that begins during the period between 2 successive normal seasonal work periods to any individual if that individual performs the service in the first of the normal seasonal work periods and if there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform the service for a seasonal employer in the second of the normal seasonal work periods. If benefits are denied to an individual for any week solely as a result of this subsection and the individual is not offered an opportunity to perform in the second normal seasonal work period for which reasonable assurance of employment had been given, the individual is entitled to a retroactive payment of benefits under this subsection for each week that the individual previously filed a timely claim for benefits. An individual may apply for any retroactive benefits under this subsection in accordance with R 421.210 of the Michigan Administrative Code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Not less than 20 days before the estimated beginning date of a normal seasonal work period, an employer may apply to the commission in writing for designation as a seasonal employer. At the time of application, the employer shall conspicuously display a copy of the application on the employer's premises. Within 90 days after receipt of the application, the commission shall determine if the employer is a seasonal employer. A determination or redetermination of the commission concerning the status of an employer as a seasonal employer, or a decision of an administrative law judge, the Michigan compensation appellate commission, or the courts of this state concerning the status of an employer as a seasonal employer, which has become final, together with the record thereof, may be introduced in any proceeding involving a claim for benefits, and the facts found and decision issued in the determination, redetermination, or decision is conclusive unless substantial evidence to the contrary is introduced by or on behalf of the claimant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the employer is determined to be a seasonal employer, the employer shall conspicuously display on its premises a notice of the determination and the beginning and ending dates of the employer's normal seasonal work periods. The commission shall furnish the notice. The notice must additionally specify that an employee must timely apply for unemployment benefits at the end of a first seasonal work period to preserve his or her right to receive retroactive unemployment benefits if he or she is not reemployed by the seasonal employer in the second of the normal seasonal work periods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The commission may issue a determination terminating an employer's status as a seasonal employer on the commission's own motion for good cause, or upon the written request of the employer. A termination determination under this subdivision terminates an employer's status as a seasonal employer, and becomes effective on the beginning date of the normal seasonal work period that would have immediately followed the date the commission issues the determination. A determination under this subdivision is subject to review in the same manner and to the same extent as any other determination under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An employer whose status as a seasonal employer is terminated under subdivision (4) may not reapply for a seasonal employer status determination until after a regularly recurring normal seasonal work period has begun and ended.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a seasonal employer informs an employee who received assurance of being rehired that, despite the assurance, the employee will not be rehired at the beginning of the employer's next normal seasonal work period, this subsection does not prevent the employee from receiving unemployment benefits in the same manner and to the same extent he or she would receive benefits under this act from an employer who has not been determined to be a seasonal employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A successor of a seasonal employer is considered to be a seasonal employer unless the successor provides the commission, within 120 days after the transfer, with a written request for termination of its status as a seasonal employer in accordance with subdivision (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) At the time an employee is hired by a seasonal employer, the employer shall notify the employee in writing if the employee will be a seasonal worker. The employer shall provide the worker with written notice of any subsequent change in the employee's status as a seasonal worker. If an employee of a seasonal employer is denied benefits because that employee is a seasonal worker, the employee may contest that designation in accordance with section 32a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) As used in this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Construction industry" means the work activity designated in sector group 23 - construction of the North American classification system - United States Office of Management and Budget, 1997 edition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Normal seasonal work period" means that period or those periods of time determined under rules promulgated by the unemployment agency during which an individual is employed in seasonal employment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Seasonal employment" means the employment of 1 or more individuals primarily hired to perform services during regularly recurring periods of 26 weeks or less in any 52-week period other than services in the construction industry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Seasonal employer" means an employer, other than an employer in the construction industry, who applies to the unemployment agency for designation as a seasonal employer and who the unemployment agency determines is an employer whose operations and business require employees engaged in seasonal employment. A seasonal employer designation under this act need not correspond to a category assigned under the North American classification system — United States Office of Management and Budget.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) "Seasonal worker" means a worker who has been paid wages by a seasonal employer for work performed only during the normal seasonal work period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) This subsection does not apply if the United States Department of Labor finds it to be contrary to the federal unemployment tax act, 26 USC 3301 to 3311, or the social security act, chapter 531, 49 Stat 620, and if conformity with the federal law is required as a condition for full tax credit against the tax imposed under the federal unemployment tax act, 26 USC 3301 to 3311, or as a condition for receipt by the commission of federal administrative grant funds under the social security act, chapter 531, 49 Stat 620.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(p) Benefits are not payable to an individual based upon his or her services as a school crossing guard for any week of unemployment that begins between 2 successive academic years or terms, if that individual performs the services of a school crossing guard in the first of the academic years or terms and has a reasonable assurance that he or she will perform those services in the second of the academic years or terms.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(q) The extension of benefits for claims for weeks beginning after January 1, 2021 but before April 1, 2021 as described in subsection (d) does not take effect unless $220,000,000.00 or more is appropriated as provided for in Senate Bill No. 748 of the 100th Legislature for deposit into the unemployment compensation fund to cover the extension of benefits. After March 1, 2021, from the funds appropriated in Senate Bill No. 748 of the 100th Legislature for Michigan unemployment compensation funds, $220,000,000.00 shall be deposited into the unemployment compensation fund for the sole purpose of funding the extension of benefits for claims for weeks beginning after January 1, 2021 but before April 1, 2021 as described in subsection (d). If federal funds are available and expenditures are allowable under federal law, expenditures of federal funds under this subsection shall occur before the expenditure of state general fund appropriations made for the same purpose described in this subsection. State general fund appropriations replaced by federal expenditures authorized under this subsection shall revert to the general fund.</div>

<P>Sec. 27a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   When an individual has had a period of unemployment: (i) for which he has been paid benefits for 1 or more weeks or has received credit for a waiting week, (ii) which commenced with a layoff by an employing unit that continued with such employing unit for more than 3 weeks, and (iii) which has been terminated by his accepting and engaging in full-time work with any employing unit within the 13 weeks immediately following his last week of employment with such employing unit, such individual shall be paid, for the most recent week in such period for which benefits are payable or were paid to him or for which he was entitled to credit for a waiting week, an amount equal to his applicable weekly benefit rate in addition to any benefits otherwise payable or paid to him for such week. An individual shall be deemed to be engaged in full-time work for an employing unit if he has earned with such employing unit within any period of 7 consecutive days commencing within such 13-week period an amount equal to his currently applicable weekly benefit rate. Benefits shall be payable under this section only to those individuals who had been paid benefits for 1 or more weeks or had received credit for a waiting week in a benefit year which had not expired prior to February 10, 1974, and only for 1 week in an individual's benefit year and only to the extent that the individual is otherwise entitled to benefits under section 27(d). To be eligible for benefits under this section, an individual shall file therefor within 13 calendar weeks after the end of the week for which benefits are payable in accordance with this section, or within 13 weeks after the week this section become effective, whichever is later. No benefits payable in accordance with this section shall be paid for any week of unemployment beginning on or after February 2, 1975.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 27b.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Beginning January 1, 1997, an individual filing a claim for unemployment benefits that establishes a new benefit year shall, at the time of filing the claim, be advised of all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That unemployment benefits are subject to federal and state income tax.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   That some taxpayers are required to make estimated tax payments.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   That the individual may elect to have both of the following deducted and withheld from his or her unemployment compensation payments:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   (i) Federal income tax in the amount specified under subchapter A of chapter 24 of subtitle C of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. 3401 to 3406.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   (ii) Effective with new claims filed on or after January 1, 1998, state income tax as provided in section 351 of the income tax act of 1967, Act No. 281 of the Public Acts of 1967, being section 206.351 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   That the individual is permitted to change a previously elected withholding status only once in the individual's benefit year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If an individual makes an election to have money deducted and withheld from his or her unemployment compensation payments under subsection (1)(c), the commission shall, in accordance with section 351 of Act No. 281 of the Public Acts of 1967, withhold a tax in the same manner that an employer is required under the internal revenue code of 1986 to withhold a tax on the compensation of an individual. For a new claim filed after January 1, 1998, an election by an individual to have income tax withheld from unemployment compensation payments applies to both federal and state income tax. An individual may not elect to have only federal or only state income tax withheld for a new claim filed after January 1, 1998.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Amounts deducted and withheld from unemployment benefits shall remain in the unemployment insurance trust fund until transferred to the internal revenue service of the United States department of treasury, or to the state department of treasury, as appropriate, as a payment of income tax.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The commission shall follow all procedures specified by the United States department of labor, the internal revenue service of the United States department of treasury, and the Michigan department of treasury pertaining to the deducting and withholding of income tax.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Amounts shall be deducted and withheld under this section only after a claimant's weekly benefit rate is reduced based on the pension reduction and earnings offset requirements of section 27, and only after a claimant's benefit payment is adjusted by amounts withheld from it by the commission to satisfy the legal obligations of restitution under section 62(a), fraud penalties under sections 54 and 54a to 54c, child support obligations under section 27, and necessaries under section 30.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   This section also applies to the first time a claimant files a claim in an existing benefit year on or after January 1, 1997.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An unemployed individual is eligible to receive benefits with respect to any week only if the unemployment agency finds all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The individual registered for work pursuant to subsection (10) after the individual applied for benefits and within the time period prescribed by the unemployment agency, has continued to report pursuant to unemployment agency rules, and is actively engaged in seeking work. The requirements that the individual must report, must register for work, must be available to perform suitable full-time work, and must seek work may be waived by the unemployment agency if the individual is laid off and the employer that laid the individual off notifies the unemployment agency in writing or by computerized data exchange that the layoff is temporary and that work is expected to be available for the individual within a declared number of days, not to exceed 45 calendar days, plus up to an additional 90 calendar days as provided for in subsection (11), following the last day the individual worked. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (12), this waiver is not effective unless the notification from the employer is received by the unemployment agency before the individual has completed his or her first compensable week following layoff. If the individual is not recalled within the specified period, the waiver ceases to be operative with respect to that layoff. Except for a period of disqualification, the requirement that the individual shall seek work may be waived by the unemployment agency if it finds that suitable work is unavailable both in the locality where the individual resides and in those localities in which the individual has earned wages during or after the base period. This waiver does not apply to a claimant enrolled and attending classes as a full-time student. An individual is considered to have satisfied the requirement of personal reporting at an employment office, as applied to a week in a period during which the requirements of registration and seeking work have been waived by the unemployment agency pursuant to this subdivision, if the individual has satisfied the personal reporting requirement with respect to a preceding week in that period and the individual has reported with respect to the week by mail pursuant to the rules promulgated by the unemployment agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The individual has made a claim for benefits pursuant to section 32 and has provided the unemployment agency with all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) His or her Social Security number.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) His or her driver license number, and the state that issued the license, or state identification card number, and the state that issued the identification card, or copies of the acceptable documents as provided in the Form I-9.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If the unemployment agency has requested them, copies of the acceptable documents as provided in the Form I-9. As used in this subdivision, "Form I-9" means the employment verification form that fulfills the employment verification obligations under 8 CFR 274a.2.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The individual is able and available to appear at a location of the unemployment agency's choosing for evaluation of eligibility for benefits, if required, and to perform suitable full-time work of a character that the individual is qualified to perform by past experience or training, which is of a character generally similar to work for which the individual has previously received wages, and for which the individual is available, full time, either at a locality at which the individual earned wages for insured work during his or her base period or at a locality where it is found by the unemployment agency that such work is available. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, for all claims filed after March 1, 2020, and established under the federal pandemic unemployment assistance program, with respect to the able and available requirements, an individual must be able and available to perform suitable full- or part-time work. An individual is considered unavailable for work under any of the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The individual fails during a benefit year to notify or update a chargeable employer with telephone, email, or other information sufficient to allow the employer to contact the individual about available work.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The individual fails, without good cause, to respond to the unemployment agency within 14 calendar days of the later of the mailing of a notice to the address of record requiring the individual to contact the unemployment agency or of the leaving of a telephone message requesting a return call and providing a return name and telephone number on an automated answering device or with an individual answering the telephone number of record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Unless the claimant shows good cause for failure to respond, mail sent to the individual's address of record is returned as undeliverable and the telephone number of record has been disconnected or changed or is otherwise no longer associated with the individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) In the event of the death of an individual's immediate family member, the eligibility requirements of availability and reporting are waived for the day of the death and for 4 consecutive calendar days thereafter. As used in this subdivision, "immediate family member" means a spouse, child, stepchild, adopted child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, brother, or sister of the individual or his or her spouse. Immediate family member includes the spouse of any of the individuals specified in the previous sentence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The individual participates in reemployment services, such as job search assistance services, if the individual has been determined or redetermined by the unemployment agency to be likely to exhaust regular benefits and need reemployment services pursuant to a profiling system established by the unemployment agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The unemployment agency may authorize an individual with an unexpired benefit year to pursue vocational training or retraining only if the unemployment agency finds all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Reasonable opportunities for employment in occupations for which the individual is fitted by training and experience do not exist in the locality in which the individual is claiming benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The vocational training course relates to an occupation or skill for which there are, or are expected to be in the immediate future, reasonable employment opportunities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The training course has been approved by a local advisory council on which both management and labor are represented, or if there is no local advisory council, by the unemployment agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The individual has the required qualifications and aptitudes to complete the course successfully.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The vocational training course has been approved by the state board of education and is maintained by a public or private school or by the unemployment agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, an otherwise eligible individual is not ineligible for benefits because he or she is participating in training with the approval of the unemployment agency. For each week that the unemployment agency finds that an individual who is claiming benefits under this act and who is participating in training with the approval of the unemployment agency, is satisfactorily pursuing an approved course of vocational training, the unemployment agency shall waive the requirements that he or she be available for work and be seeking work as prescribed in subsection (1)(a) and (c), and shall find good cause for his or her failure to apply for suitable work, report to a former employer for an interview concerning suitable work, or accept suitable work as required in section 29(1)(c), (d), and (e).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this act, an otherwise eligible individual must not be denied benefits solely because the individual is in training approved under section 236(a)(1) of the trade act of 1974, 19 USC 2296, nor shall the individual be denied benefits by reason of leaving work to enter such training if the work left is not suitable employment. Furthermore, an otherwise eligible individual must not be denied benefits because of the application to any such week in training of provisions of this act, or any applicable federal unemployment compensation law, relating to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work. For purposes of this subsection, "suitable employment" means, with respect to an individual, work of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the individual's past adversely affected employment, as defined for purposes of the trade act of 1974, 19 USC 2101 to 2497b, and wages for that work at not less than 80% of the individual's average weekly wage as determined for the purposes of the trade act of 1974, 19 USC 2101 to 2497b.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (6), for purposes of this section, for benefit years beginning on or after January 1, 2013, to be actively engaged in seeking work, an individual must conduct a systematic and sustained search for work in each week the individual is claiming benefits, using any of the following methods to report the details of the work search:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Reporting at monthly intervals on the unemployment agency's online reporting system the name of each employer and physical or online location of each employer where work was sought and the date and method by which work was sought with each employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Filing a written report with the unemployment agency by mail or facsimile transmission not later than the end of the fourth calendar week after the end of the week in which the individual engaged in the work search, on a form approved by the unemployment agency, indicating the name of each employer and physical or online location of each employer where work was sought and the date and method by which work was sought with each employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Appearing at least monthly in person at a Michigan works agency office to report the name and physical or online location of each employer where the individual sought work during the previous month and the date and method by which work was sought with each employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For purposes of this section, beginning on April 2, 2020, to be actively engaged in seeking work, an individual must conduct a systematic and sustained search for work in each week the individual is claiming benefits and must report to the unemployment agency the details of the work search at least once every 2 weeks or, if the unemployment agency prescribes a shorter reporting period, the reporting period prescribed by the unemployment agency. An individual may conduct a systematic and sustained search for work by doing any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Using resources available at a Michigan works agency office to do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Participate in reemployment services and eligibility assessment activities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Identify the skills the individual possesses that are consistent with target or demand occupations in the local workforce development area.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Obtain job postings and seek employment for suitable positions needed by local employers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Attending job search seminars or other employment workshops that offer instruction in improving an individual's skills for finding and obtaining employment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Creating a user profile on a professional networking site or using an online career tool. Creating duplicate user profiles or resubmitting or reuploading the same resume to the same professional networking site does not satisfy the requirements of this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Applying for an available position with, submitting a resume to, or interviewing with employers. Applying for the same position within a 4-week period or contacting an employer to determine whether a position is available does not satisfy the requirements of this subdivision, unless the individual uses his or her union hiring hall to conduct a search for work.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Registering for work with a private employment agency or, if it is available to the individual in his or her occupation or profession, the placement facility of a school, college, or university.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Taking an examination that is required for a position in the state civil service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The work search conducted by the claimant is subject to audit by the unemployment agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The unemployment agency shall request but shall not require an individual who is applying for benefits to submit his or her base period employer's unemployment agency account number and federal employer identification number.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The unemployment agency shall use all of the documentation and information provided by an individual applying for benefits to verify the identity of the individual before making an initial payment on the individual's claim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) An individual must register for work as required under subsection (1)(a) by registering with a Michigan works agency. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The unemployment agency may extend a waiver described in subsection (1)(a) beyond 45 calendar days, but not for more than an additional 90 calendar days, if, before the end of the specified period of the waiver, the employer notifies the unemployment agency in writing or by computerized data exchange that the layoff is an extended layoff and is the result of 1 or more of the following: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The retooling of the employer's equipment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A parts shortage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A temporary production volume adjustment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If an individual is laid off because of an extended layoff described in subsection (11) that existed on May 31, 2021, the requirements that the individual must report, must register for work, must be available to perform suitable full-time work, and must seek work may be waived by the unemployment agency as described in subsection (1)(a) if, before July 16, 2021, the individual's employer notifies the unemployment agency pursuant to subsection (11) that the individual was laid off because of an extended layoff described in subsection (11). The specified period of a waiver granted under this subsection begins on May 31, 2021. </div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   For benefit years beginning before the conversion date prescribed in section 75, and notwithstanding any other provision of this act, an unemployed individual who has a benefit year in effect and who has not exhausted benefit entitlement may have unused credit weeks preserved during a period of continuous involuntary disability if a written request from the individual to preserve the unused credit weeks is received by the commission within 90 days after the commencement of the period of disability, within 90 days after being advised of his or her rights by the commission, or if the individual is unable to submit the written request due to a medical inability, within 90 days after the end of that medical inability. For benefit years beginning after the conversion date prescribed in section 75, and notwithstanding any other provision of this act, an unemployed individual who has a benefit year in effect and who has not exhausted benefit entitlement may have unused benefit entitlement preserved during a period of continuous involuntary disability if a written request from the individual to preserve the unused benefit entitlement is received by the commission within 90 days after the commencement of the period of disability, within 90 days after being advised of his or her rights by the commission, or if the individual is unable to submit the written request due to a medical inability, within 90 days after the end of that medical inability.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For benefit years beginning before the conversion date prescribed in section 75, unused credit weeks shall not be preserved pursuant to this section unless the commission receives a written statement from the individual's physician within 90 days after the commencement of the disability, within 90 days after the individual is advised of his or her rights by the commission, or if the individual is unable to submit the written statement due to a medical inability, within 90 days after the end of that medical inability the commission receives the written statement from the individual's physician. The written statement from the individual's physician shall certify all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The nature of the injury, illness, or hospitalization.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   That based upon the examination of the physician, the individual is not able and available to perform full-time work as described in section 28(1)(c).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The probable duration of the injury, illness, or hospitalization.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   For benefit years beginning after the conversion date prescribed in section 75, unused benefit entitlement shall not be preserved pursuant to this section unless the commission receives a written statement from the individual's physician within 90 days after the commencement of the disability, within 90 days after the individual is advised of his or her rights by the commission, or if the individual is unable to submit the written statement due to a medical inability, within 90 days after the end of that medical inability the commission receives the written statement from the individual's physician. The written statement from the individual's physician shall certify all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The nature of the injury, illness, or hospitalization.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   That based upon the examination of the physician, the individual is not able and available to perform full-time work as described in section 28(1)(c).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The probable duration of the injury, illness, or hospitalization.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The commission immediately shall provide a copy of the statement required by subsection (2) to the individual's last employer and all base period employers.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   For benefit years beginning before the conversion date as prescribed in section 75, an individual who has unused credit weeks preserved pursuant to this section shall receive an extension of his or her benefit year equal in weeks to the number of weeks the period of disability continued during the benefit year. The extension shall begin with the week after the week in which the disability terminated. Benefits may be paid for weeks of unemployment after the period of disability if the individual is eligible and qualified but benefits shall not be payable under this section for any week that commences more than 156 weeks after the first week of the benefit year. For benefit years beginning after the conversion date prescribed in section 75, an individual who has unused benefit entitlement preserved pursuant to this section shall receive an extension of his or her benefit year equal in weeks to the number of weeks the period of disability continued during the benefit year. The extension shall begin with the week after the week in which the disability terminated. Benefits may be paid for weeks of unemployment after the period of disability if the individual is eligible and qualified but benefits shall not be payable under this section for any week that commences more than 156 weeks after the first week of the benefit year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   As used in this section, a period of "continuous disability" means a period continuing for more than 14 consecutive days during which an unemployed individual is not able and available to perform full-time work, as described in section 28(1)(c), due to injury, illness, or hospitalization.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   For benefit years beginning before the conversion date prescribed in section 75, an unemployed individual who has been unable to establish a benefit year solely due to a period of continuous disability may preserve all credit weeks earned by the individual in the 52 week period preceding the individual's first week of unemployment, as defined in section 48, caused by the disability. However, credit weeks may be preserved if the commission receives a written request and a physician's statement, as described in subsections (1) and (2) within 90 days after the commencement of the unemployment, within 90 days after being advised of his or her rights by the commission, or if the individual is unable to submit the written statement and request due to a medical inability, within 90 days after the end of that medical inability. The individual's benefit year shall begin the first week the individual was both unemployed and disabled, and the benefit year shall be extended pursuant to subsection (4). For benefit years beginning after the conversion date prescribed in section 75, an unemployed individual who has been unable to establish a benefit year solely due to an inability to file a claim because of a period of continuous disability may preserve all unused benefit entitlement in the base period preceding the individual's first week of unemployment, as defined in section 48, caused by the disability. However, benefit entitlement may be preserved if the commission receives a written request and a physician's statement, as described in subsections (1) and (2) within 90 days after the commencement of the unemployment, within 90 days after being advised of his or her rights by the commission, or if the individual is unable to submit the written statement and request due to a medical inability, within 90 days after the end of that medical inability. The individual's benefit year shall begin the first week the individual was both unemployed and disabled, and the benefit year shall be extended pursuant to subsection (4).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   For benefit years beginning before the conversion date prescribed in section 75, if an individual has sufficient credit weeks to establish a new benefit year under section 46 after the termination of the period of continuous disability, and is otherwise eligible and qualified for benefits, the individual shall cease to be entitled to benefits under this section. For benefit years beginning after the conversion date prescribed in section 75, if an individual has sufficient base period wages to establish a new benefit year under section 46 after the termination of the period of continuous disability, and is otherwise eligible and qualified for benefits, the individual shall cease to be entitled to benefits under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   This section shall apply to all benefit years that commence after the effective date of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   The commission shall disseminate information on this section to potential interested parties including the legal profession, employers, and unions.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   For benefit years beginning before the conversion date prescribed in section 75, and notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a request for preservation of credit weeks must be made within 3 years after the date the disability began. For benefit years beginning after the conversion date prescribed in section 75, and notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a request for preservation of benefit entitlement must be made within 3 years after the date the disability began.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If federal funding is available to this state for the purpose of partial reimbursement for the cost of funding benefits paid by the unemployment agency pursuant to an agreement entered into between this state and the United States department of labor pursuant to section 2163 of the layoff prevention act of 2012, any approved shared-work plan shall provide that the employer shall make a reimbursing payment in lieu of contributions to this state equal to 1/2 of the benefits paid under the employer's approved shared-work plan. That payment shall be deposited into this state's unemployment compensation fund. Benefit payments or deposits made under this subdivision shall not be used for purposes of calculating an employer's contribution rate under section 19.

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>421.29 Disqualification from benefits; exception during COVID-19 pandemic.</B><P>Sec. 29.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in subsection (5), an individual is disqualified from receiving benefits if he or she:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Left work voluntarily without good cause attributable to the employer or employing unit. An individual who left work is presumed to have left work voluntarily without good cause attributable to the employer or employing unit. An individual who is absent from work for a period of 3 consecutive work days or more without contacting the employer in a manner acceptable to the employer and of which the individual was informed at the time of hire is considered to have voluntarily left work without good cause attributable to the employer. An individual who becomes unemployed as a result of negligently losing a requirement for the job of which he or she was informed at the time of hire is considered to have voluntarily left work without good cause attributable to the employer. An individual claiming benefits under this act has the burden of proof to establish that he or she left work involuntarily or for good cause that was attributable to the employer or employing unit. An individual claiming to have left work involuntarily for medical reasons must have done all of the following before the leaving: secured a statement from a medical professional that continuing in the individual's current job would be harmful to the individual's physical or mental health, unsuccessfully attempted to secure alternative work with the employer, and unsuccessfully attempted to be placed on a leave of absence with the employer to last until the individual's mental or physical health would no longer be harmed by the current job. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, with respect to claims for weeks beginning before April 1, 2021, an individual is considered to have left work involuntarily for medical reasons if he or she leaves work to self-isolate or self-quarantine in response to elevated risk from COVID-19 because he or she is immunocompromised, displayed a commonly recognized principal symptom of COVID-19 that was not otherwise associated with a known medical or physical condition of the individual, had contact in the last 14 days with an individual with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, needed to care for an individual with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, or had a family care responsibility that was the result of a government directive regarding COVID-19. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, with respect to claims for weeks beginning before April 1, 2021, the unemployment agency may consider an individual laid off if the individual became unemployed to self-isolate or self-quarantine in response to elevated risk from COVID-19 because he or she is immunocompromised, displayed a commonly recognized principal symptom of COVID-19 that was not otherwise associated with a known medical or physical condition of the individual, had contact in the last 14 days with an individual with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, needed to care for an individual with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, or had a family care responsibility that was the result of a government directive regarding COVID-19. However, if any of the following conditions are met, the leaving does not disqualify the individual:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The individual has an established benefit year in effect and during that benefit year leaves unsuitable work within 60 days after the beginning of that work. Benefits paid after a leaving under this subparagraph must not be charged to the experience account of the employer the individual left, but must be charged instead to the nonchargeable benefits account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The individual is the spouse of a full-time member of the United States Armed Forces, and the leaving is due to the military duty reassignment of that member of the United States Armed Forces to a different geographic location. Benefits paid after a leaving under this subparagraph must not be charged to the experience account of the employer the individual left, but must be charged instead to the nonchargeable benefits account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The individual is concurrently working part-time for an employer or employing unit and for another employer or employing unit and voluntarily leaves the part-time work while continuing work with the other employer. The portion of the benefits paid in accordance with this subparagraph that would otherwise be charged to the experience account of the part-time employer that the individual left must not be charged to the account of that employer but must be charged instead to the nonchargeable benefits account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The individual is a victim of domestic violence who meets the requirements in section 29a. Benefits paid after a leaving under this subparagraph must not be charged to the experience account of the employer the individual left, but must be charged instead to the nonchargeable benefits account. This subparagraph does not apply after March 31, 2021.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Was suspended or discharged for misconduct connected with the individual's work or for intoxication while at work.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Failed without good cause to apply diligently for available suitable work after receiving notice from the unemployment agency of the availability of that work or failed to apply for work with employers that could reasonably be expected to have suitable work available.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Failed without good cause while unemployed to report to the individual's former employer or employing unit within a reasonable time after that employer or employing unit provided notice of the availability of an interview concerning available suitable work with the former employer or employing unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Failed without good cause to accept suitable work offered to the individual or to return to the individual's customary self-employment, if any, when directed by the employment office or the unemployment agency. An employer that receives a monetary determination under section 32 may notify the unemployment agency regarding the availability of suitable work with the employer on the monetary determination or other form provided by the unemployment agency. Upon receipt of the notice of the availability of suitable work, the unemployment agency shall notify the claimant of the availability of suitable work. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Lost his or her job due to absence from work resulting from a violation of law for which the individual was convicted and sentenced to jail or prison. This subdivision does not apply if conviction of an individual results in a sentence to county jail under conditions of day parole as provided in 1962 PA 60, MCL 801.251 to 801.258, or if the conviction was for a traffic violation that resulted in an absence of less than 10 consecutive work days from the individual's place of employment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Is discharged, whether or not the discharge is subsequently reduced to a disciplinary layoff or suspension, for participation in either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A strike or other concerted action in violation of an applicable collective bargaining agreement that results in curtailment of work or restriction of or interference with production.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A wildcat strike or other concerted action not authorized by the individual's recognized bargaining representative.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Was discharged for an act of assault and battery connected with the individual's work.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Was discharged for theft connected with the individual's work.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Was discharged for willful destruction of property connected with the individual's work.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) Committed a theft after receiving notice of a layoff or discharge, but before the effective date of the layoff or discharge, resulting in loss or damage to the employer who would otherwise be chargeable for the benefits, regardless of whether the individual qualified for the benefits before the theft.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) Was employed by a temporary help firm, which as used in this section means an employer whose primary business is to provide a client with the temporary services of 1 or more individuals under contract with the employer, to perform services for a client of that firm if each of the following conditions is met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The temporary help firm provided the employee with a written notice before the employee began performing services for the client stating in substance both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) That within 7 days after completing services for a client of the temporary help firm, the employee is under a duty to notify the temporary help firm of the completion of those services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) That a failure to provide the temporary help firm with notice of the employee's completion of services pursuant to sub-subparagraph (A) constitutes a voluntary quit that will affect the employee's eligibility for unemployment compensation if the employee seeks unemployment compensation following completion of those services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The employee did not provide the temporary help firm with notice that the employee had completed his or her services for the client within 7 days after completion of his or her services for the client.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) Was discharged for illegally ingesting, injecting, inhaling, or possessing a controlled substance on the premises of the employer; refusing to submit to a drug test that was required to be administered in a nondiscriminatory manner; or testing positive on a drug test, if the test was administered in a nondiscriminatory manner. If the worker disputes the result of the testing, and if a generally accepted confirmatory test has not been administered on the same sample previously tested, then a generally accepted confirmatory test must be administered on that sample. If the confirmatory test also indicates a positive result for the presence of a controlled substance, the worker who is discharged as a result of the test result will be disqualified under this subdivision. A report by a drug testing facility showing a positive result for the presence of a controlled substance is conclusive unless there is substantial evidence to the contrary. As used in this subdivision: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) "Controlled substance" means that term as defined in section 7104 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7104.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) "Drug test" means a test designed to detect the illegal use of a controlled substance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) "Nondiscriminatory manner" means administered impartially and objectively in accordance with a collective bargaining agreement, rule, policy, a verbal or written notice, or a labor-management contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) Theft from the employer that resulted in the employee's conviction, within 2 years of the date of the discharge, of theft or a lesser included offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A disqualification under subsection (1) begins the week in which the act or discharge that caused the disqualification occurs and continues until the disqualified individual requalifies under subsection (3). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) After the week in which the disqualifying act or discharge described in subsection (1) occurs, an individual who seeks to requalify for benefits is subject to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For benefit years established before October 1, 2000, the individual must complete 6 requalifying weeks if he or she was disqualified under subsection (1)(c), (d), (e), (f), (g), or (l), or 13 requalifying weeks if he or she was disqualified under subsection (1)(h), (i), (j), (k), or (m). A requalifying week required under this subdivision is each week in which the individual does any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Earns or receives remuneration in an amount at least equal to an amount needed to earn a credit week, as that term is defined in section 50.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Otherwise meets all of the requirements of this act to receive a benefit payment if the individual were not disqualified under subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Receives a benefit payment based on credit weeks subsequent to the disqualifying act or discharge.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For benefit years established before October 1, 2000, if the individual is disqualified under subsection (1)(a) or (b), he or she must requalify, after the week in which the disqualifying discharge occurred by earning in employment for an employer liable under this act or the unemployment compensation act of another state an amount equal to, or in excess of, 7 times the individual's potential weekly benefit rate, calculated on the basis of employment with the employer involved in the disqualification, or by earning in employment for an employer liable under this act or the unemployment compensation act of another state an amount equal to, or in excess of, 40 times the state minimum hourly wage times 7, whichever is the lesser amount.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For benefit years established before October 1, 2000, a benefit payable to an individual disqualified under subsection (1)(a) or (b) must be charged to the nonchargeable benefits account, and not to the account of the employer with whom the individual was involved in the disqualification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) For benefit years beginning on or after October 1, 2000, after the week in which the disqualifying act or discharge occurred, an individual must complete 13 requalifying weeks if he or she was disqualified under subsection (1)(c), (d), (e), (f), (g), or (l), or 26 requalifying weeks if he or she was disqualified under subsection (1)(h), (i), (j), (k), (m), or (n). A requalifying week required under this subdivision is each week in which the individual does any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Earns or receives remuneration in an amount equal to at least 1/13 of the minimum amount needed in a calendar quarter of the base period for an individual to qualify for benefits, rounded down to the nearest whole dollar.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Otherwise meets all of the requirements of this act to receive a benefit payment if the individual was not disqualified under subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) For benefit years beginning on or after October 1, 2000 and beginning before April 26, 2002, if the individual is disqualified under subsection (1)(a) or (b), he or she must requalify, after the week in which the disqualifying act or discharge occurred by earning in employment for an employer liable under this act or the unemployment compensation law of another state at least the lesser of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Seven times the individual's weekly benefit rate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Forty times the state minimum hourly wage times 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) For benefit years beginning on or after April 26, 2002, if the individual is disqualified under subsection (1)(a), he or she must requalify, after the week in which the disqualifying act or discharge occurred by earning in employment for an employer liable under this act or the unemployment compensation law of another state at least 12 times the individual's weekly benefit rate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) For benefit years beginning on or after April 26, 2002, if the individual is disqualified under subsection (1)(b), he or she must requalify, after the week in which the disqualifying act or discharge occurred by earning in employment for an employer liable under this act or the unemployment compensation law of another state at least 17 times the individual's weekly benefit rate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) A benefit payable to the individual disqualified or separated under disqualifying circumstances under subsection (1)(a) or (b) must be charged to the nonchargeable benefits account, and not to the account of the employer with whom the individual was involved in the separation. Benefits payable to an individual determined by the unemployment agency to be separated under disqualifying circumstances must not be charged to the account of the employer involved in the disqualification for any period after the employer notifies the unemployment agency of the claimant's possible ineligibility or disqualification. However, an individual filing a new claim for benefits who reports the reason for separation from a base period employer as a voluntary leaving is presumed to have voluntarily left without good cause attributable to the employer and is disqualified unless the individual provides substantial evidence to rebut the presumption. If a disqualifying act or discharge occurs during the individual's benefit year, any benefits that may become payable to the individual in a later benefit year based on employment with the employer involved in the disqualification must be charged to the nonchargeable benefits account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The maximum amount of benefits otherwise available under section 27(d) to an individual disqualified under subsection (1) is subject to all of the following conditions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For benefit years established before October 1, 2000, if the individual is disqualified under subsection (1)(c), (d), (e), (f), (g), or (l) and the maximum amount of benefits is based on wages and credit weeks earned from an employer before an act or discharge involving that employer, the amount must be reduced by an amount equal to the individual's weekly benefit rate as to that employer multiplied by the lesser of either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The number of requalifying weeks required of the individual under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The number of weeks of benefit entitlement remaining with that employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the individual has insufficient or no potential benefit entitlement remaining with the employer involved in the disqualification in the benefit year in existence on the date of the disqualifying determination, a reduction of benefits described in this subsection applies in a succeeding benefit year with respect to any benefit entitlement based upon credit weeks earned with the employer before the disqualifying act or discharge.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For benefit years established before October 1, 2000, an individual disqualified under subsection (1)(h), (i), (j), (k), or (m) is not entitled to benefits based on wages and credit weeks earned before the disqualifying act or discharge with the employer involved in the disqualification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The benefit entitlement of an individual disqualified under subsection (1)(a) or (b) is not subject to reduction as a result of that disqualification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A denial or reduction of benefits under this subsection does not apply to benefits based upon multiemployer credit weeks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) For benefit years established on or after October 1, 2000, if the individual is disqualified under subsection (1)(c), (d), (e), (f), (g), or (l), the maximum number of weeks otherwise applicable in calculating benefits for the individual under section 27(d) must be reduced by the lesser of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The number of requalifying weeks required of the individual under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The number of weeks of benefit entitlement remaining on the claim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) For benefit years beginning on or after October 1, 2000, the benefits of an individual disqualified under subsection (1)(h), (i), (j), (k), (m), or (n) must be reduced by 13 weeks and any weekly benefit payments made to the claimant thereafter must be reduced by the portion of the payment attributable to base period wages paid by the base period employer involved in a disqualification under subsection (1)(h), (i), (j), (k), (m), or (n).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Subject to subsection (11), if an individual leaves work to accept permanent full-time work with another employer or to accept a referral to another employer from the individual's union hiring hall and performs services for that employer, or if an individual leaves work to accept a recall from a former employer, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Subsection (1) does not apply.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Wages earned with the employer whom the individual last left, including wages previously transferred under this subsection to the last employer, for the purpose of computing and charging benefits, are wages earned from the employer with whom the individual accepted work or recall, and benefits paid based upon those wages must be charged to that employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) When issuing a determination covering the period of employment with a new or former employer described in this subsection, the unemployment agency shall advise the chargeable employer of the name and address of the other employer, the period covered by the employment, and the extent of the benefits that may be charged to the account of the chargeable employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) In determining whether work is suitable for an individual, the unemployment agency shall consider the degree of risk involved to the individual's health, safety, and morals, the individual's physical fitness and prior training, the individual's length of unemployment and prospects for securing local work in the individual's customary occupation, and the distance of the available work from the individual's residence. Additionally, the unemployment agency shall consider the individual's experience and prior earnings, but an unemployed individual who refuses an offer of work determined to be suitable under this section must be denied benefits if the pay rate for that work is at least 70% of the gross pay rate he or she received immediately before becoming unemployed. Beginning January 15, 2012, after an individual has received benefits for 50% of the benefit weeks in the individual's benefit year, work is not considered unsuitable because it is outside of the individual's training or experience or unsuitable as to pay rate if the pay rate for that work meets or exceeds the minimum wage; is at least the prevailing mean wage for similar work in the locality for the most recent full calendar year for which data are available as published by the department of technology, management, and budget as "wages by job title", by standard metropolitan statistical area; and is 120% or more of the individual's weekly benefit amount.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Work is not suitable and benefits must not be denied under this act to an otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work under any of the following conditions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the remuneration, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are substantially less favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If as a condition of being employed, the individual would be required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining a bona fide labor organization.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) All of the following apply to an individual who seeks benefits under this act:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An individual is disqualified from receiving benefits for a week in which the individual's total or partial unemployment is due to either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A labor dispute in active progress at the place at which the individual is or was last employed, or a shutdown or start-up operation caused by that labor dispute.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A labor dispute, other than a lockout, in active progress or a shutdown or start-up operation caused by that labor dispute in any other establishment within the United States that is both functionally integrated with the establishment described in subparagraph (i) and operated by the same employing unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An individual's disqualification imposed or imposable under this subsection is terminated if the individual performs services in employment with an employer in at least 2 consecutive weeks falling wholly within the period of the individual's total or partial unemployment due to the labor dispute, and in addition earns wages in each of those weeks in an amount equal to or greater than the individual's actual or potential weekly benefit rate. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An individual is not disqualified under this subsection if the individual is not directly involved in the labor dispute. An individual is not directly involved in a labor dispute unless any of the following are established:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) At the time or in the course of a labor dispute in the establishment in which the individual was then employed, the individual in concert with 1 or more other employees voluntarily stopped working other than at the direction of the individual's employing unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The individual is participating in, financing, or directly interested in the labor dispute that causes the individual's total or partial unemployment. The payment of regular union dues, in amounts and for purposes established before the inception of the labor dispute, is not financing a labor dispute within the meaning of this subparagraph.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) At any time a labor dispute in the establishment or department in which the individual was employed does not exist, and the individual voluntarily stops working, other than at the direction of the individual's employing unit, in sympathy with employees in some other establishment or department in which a labor dispute is in progress.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The individual's total or partial unemployment is due to a labor dispute that was or is in progress in a department, unit, or group of workers in the same establishment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) As used in this subsection, "directly interested" must be construed and applied so as not to disqualify individuals unemployed as a result of a labor dispute the resolution of which may not reasonably be expected to affect their wages, hours, or other conditions of employment, and to disqualify individuals whose wages, hours, or conditions of employment may reasonably be expected to be affected by the resolution of the labor dispute. A "reasonable expectation" of an effect on an individual's wages, hours, or other conditions of employment exists, in the absence of a substantial preponderance of evidence to the contrary, in any of the following situations:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If it is established that there is in the particular establishment or employing unit a practice, custom, or contractual obligation to extend within a reasonable period to members of the individual's grade or class of workers in the establishment in which the individual is or was last employed changes in terms and conditions of employment that are substantially similar or related to some or all of the changes in terms and conditions of employment that are made for the workers among whom there exists the labor dispute that has caused the individual's total or partial unemployment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If it is established that l of the issues in or purposes of the labor dispute is to obtain a change in the terms and conditions of employment for members of the individual's grade or class of workers in the establishment in which the individual is or was last employed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If a collective bargaining agreement covers both the individual's grade or class of workers in the establishment in which the individual is or was last employed and the workers in another establishment of the same employing unit who are actively participating in the labor dispute, and that collective bargaining agreement is subject by its terms to modification, supplementation, or replacement, or has expired or been opened by mutual consent at the time of the labor dispute.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) In determining the scope of the grade or class of workers, evidence of the following is relevant:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Representation of the workers by the same national or international organization or by local affiliates of that national or international organization.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Whether the workers are included in a single, legally designated, or negotiated bargaining unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Whether the workers are or within the past 6 months have been covered by a common master collective bargaining agreement that sets forth all or any part of the terms and conditions of the workers' employment, or by separate agreements that are or have been bargained as a part of the same negotiations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Any functional integration of the work performed by those workers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Whether the resolution of those issues involved in the labor dispute as to some of the workers could directly or indirectly affect the advancement, negotiation, or settlement of the same or similar issues in respect to the remaining workers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) Whether the workers are currently or have been covered by the same or similar demands by their recognized or certified bargaining agent or agents for changes in their wages, hours, or other conditions of employment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vii) Whether issues on the same subject matter as those involved in the labor dispute have been the subject of proposals or demands made upon the employing unit that would by their terms have applied to those workers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (8), if the employing unit submits notice to the unemployment agency of possible ineligibility or disqualification beyond the time limits prescribed by unemployment agency rule and the unemployment agency concludes that benefits should not have been paid, the claimant shall repay the benefits paid during the entire period of ineligibility or disqualification. The unemployment agency shall not charge interest on repayments required under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) An individual is disqualified from receiving benefits for any week or part of a week in which the individual has received, is receiving, or is seeking unemployment benefits under an unemployment compensation law of another state or of the United States. If the appropriate agency of the other state or of the United States finally determines that the individual is not entitled to unemployment benefits, the disqualification described in this subsection does not apply.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Beginning on May 1, 2020, and until the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection, if an individual leaves work to accept permanent full-time work with another employer, the individual is considered to have met the requirements of subsection (5) regardless of whether the individual actually performed services for the other employer or whether the work was permanent full-time work. Benefits payable to the individual must be charged to the nonchargeable benefits account.</div>

Smith v Employment Security Commission, 410 Mich 231; 301 NW2d 285 (1981).Claimant's failure to pay agency shop fees after receiving notice from her employer showed a wilful disregard of the employer's interest. The claimant did not have a constitutional right not to pay the required fees, and any effect on her First Amendment interests was outweighed by the state's interest in not using its moneys to pay unemployment benefits to persons who are disqualified under the act.

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>421.32 Claims for benefits; examination; determination; notice.</B><P>Sec. 32.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Claims for benefits shall be made pursuant to regulations prescribed by the unemployment agency. The unemployment agency shall designate representatives who shall promptly examine claims and make a determination on the facts. The unemployment agency may establish rules providing for the examination of claims, the determination of the validity of the claims, and the amount and duration of benefits to be paid. The claimant and other interested parties shall be promptly notified of the determination and the reasons for the determination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The unemployment agency shall mail to the claimant, to each base period employer or employing unit, and to the separating employer or employing unit, a monetary determination. The monetary determination shall notify each of these employers or employing units that the claimant has filed an application for benefits and the amount the claimant reported as earned with the separating employer or employing unit, and shall state the name of each employer or employing unit in the base period and the name of the separating employer or employing unit. The monetary determination shall also state the claimant's weekly benefit rate, the amount of base period wages paid by each base period employer, the maximum benefit amount that could be charged to each employer's account or experience account, and the reason for separation reported by the claimant. The monetary determination shall also state whether the claimant is monetarily eligible to receive unemployment benefits. Except for separations under section 29(1)(a), no further reconsideration of a separation from any base period employer will be made unless the base period employer notifies the unemployment agency of a possible disqualifying separation within 30 days of the separation in accordance with this subsection. Charges to the employer and payments to the claimant shall be as described in section 20(a). New, additional, or corrected information received by the unemployment agency more than 10 days after mailing the monetary determination shall be considered a request for reconsideration by the employer of the monetary determination and shall be reviewed as provided in section 32a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For the purpose of determining a claimant's nonmonetary eligibility and qualification for benefits, if the claimant's most recent base period or benefit year separation was for a reason other than the lack of work, then a determination shall be issued concerning that separation to the claimant and to the separating employer. If a claimant is not disqualified based on his or her most recent separation from employment and has satisfied the requirements of section 29, the unemployment agency shall issue a nonmonetary determination as to that separation only. If a claimant is not disqualified based on his or her most recent separation from employment and has not satisfied the requirements of section 29, the unemployment agency shall issue 1 or more nonmonetary determinations necessary to establish the claimant's qualification for benefits based on any prior separation in inverse chronological order. The unemployment agency shall consider all base period separations involving disqualifications under section 29(1)(h), (i), (j), (k), (m), or (n) in determining a claimant's nonmonetary eligibility and qualification for benefits. An employer may designate in writing to the unemployment agency an individual or another employer or an employing unit to receive any notice required to be given by the unemployment agency to that employer or to represent that employer in any proceeding before the unemployment agency as provided in section 31. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, beginning May 1, 2020, and until the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection, in determining a claimant's nonmonetary eligibility to qualify for benefits, the unemployment agency shall not issue a determination with respect to the claimant's separation from a base period or benefit year employer other than the separating employer, and the unemployment agency shall consider the claimant to have satisfied the requirements of section 29(2) and (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If the unemployment agency requests additional monetary or nonmonetary information from an employer or employing unit and the unemployment agency fails to receive a written response from the employer or employing unit within 10 calendar days after the date of mailing the request for information, the unemployment agency shall make a determination based upon the available information at the time the determination is made. Charges to the employer and payments to the claimant shall be as described in section 20(a).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The claimant or interested party may file an application with an office of the unemployment agency for a redetermination in accordance with section 32a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The issuance of each benefit check shall be considered a determination by the unemployment agency that the claimant receiving the check was covered during the compensable period, and eligible and qualified for benefits. A chargeable employer, upon receipt of a listing of the check as provided in section 21(a), may protest by requesting a redetermination of the claimant's eligibility or qualification as to that period and a determination as to later weeks and benefits still unpaid that are affected by the protest. Upon receipt of the protest or request, the unemployment agency shall investigate and redetermine whether the claimant is eligible and qualified as to that period. If, upon the redetermination, the claimant is found ineligible or not qualified, the unemployment agency shall proceed as described in section 62. In addition, the unemployment agency shall investigate and determine whether the claimant obtained benefits for 1 or more preceding weeks within the series of consecutive weeks that includes the week covered by the redetermination and, if so, shall proceed as described in section 62 as to those weeks. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, for benefits charged after March 15, 2020 but before April 1, 2021, an employer has 1 year after the date a benefit payment is charged against the employer's account to protest that charge.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) If a claimant commences to file continued claims through a different state claim office in this state or elsewhere, the unemployment agency promptly shall issue written notice of that fact to the chargeable employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) If a claimant refuses an offer of work, or fails to apply for work of which the claimant has been notified, as provided in section 29(1)(c) or (e), the unemployment agency shall promptly make a written determination as to whether or not the refusal or failure requires disqualification under section 29. Notice of the determination, specifying the name and address of the employing unit offering or giving notice of the work and of the chargeable employer, shall be sent to the claimant, the employing unit offering or giving notice of the work, and the chargeable employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The unemployment agency shall issue a notification to the claimant of claimant rights and responsibilities within 2 weeks after the initial benefit payment on a claim and 6 months after the initial benefit payment on the claim. If the claimant selected a preferred form of communication, the notification must be conveyed by that form. Issuing the notification must not delay or interfere with the claimant's benefit payment. The notification must contain clear and understandable information pertaining to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Determinations as provided in section 62.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Penalties and other sanctions as provided in this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Legal right to protest the determination and the right to appeal through the administrative hearing system. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Other information needed to understand and comply with agency rules and regulations not specified in this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Upon application by an interested party for review of a determination, upon request for transfer to an administrative law judge for a hearing filed with the unemployment agency within 30 days after the mailing or personal service of a notice of determination, or upon the unemployment agency's own motion within that 30-day period, the unemployment agency shall review any determination. After review, the unemployment agency shall in its discretion issue a redetermination affirming, modifying, or reversing the prior determination and stating the reasons for the redetermination, or may transfer the matter to an administrative law judge for a hearing. If the unemployment agency issues a redetermination, it shall promptly notify the interested parties of the redetermination. The redetermination is final unless within 30 days after the mailing or personal service of a notice of the redetermination an appeal is filed with the unemployment agency for a hearing on the redetermination before an administrative law judge pursuant to section 33.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The unemployment agency shall, for good cause, including an administrative clerical error or evidence produced by an interested party showing that a prior determination or redetermination was not sent to the interested party's correct address or an address ascertained under subsection (5), reconsider a prior determination or redetermination after the 30-day period has expired and after reconsideration issue a redetermination affirming, modifying, or reversing the prior determination or redetermination, or transfer the matter to an administrative law judge for a hearing. A reconsideration shall not be made unless the request is filed with the unemployment agency, or reconsideration is initiated by the unemployment agency with notice to the interested parties, within 1 year after the date of mailing or personal service of the original determination on the disputed issue or, if the original determination involved a finding of fraud, within 3 years after the date of mailing or personal service of the original determination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If an interested party fails to file a protest within the 30-day period and the unemployment agency for good cause reconsiders a prior determination or redetermination and issues a redetermination, a disqualification, or an ineligibility imposed thereunder, other than an ineligibility imposed due to receipt of retroactive pay, the redetermination, disqualification, or ineligibility does not apply to a compensable period for which benefits were paid or are payable unless the benefits were obtained as a result of an administrative clerical error, a false statement, or a nondisclosure or misrepresentation of a material fact by the claimant. However, the redetermination is final unless within 30 days after the date of mailing or personal service of the notice of redetermination an appeal is filed for a hearing on the redetermination before an administrative law judge pursuant to section 33.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In addition to the transfer provisions in subsections (1) and (2), both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If both the claimant and the employer agree, the matter may be transferred directly to an administrative law judge in a case involving the payment of unemployment benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If both the unemployment agency and the employer agree, the matter may be transferred directly to an administrative law judge in a case involving unemployment contributions or reimbursements in lieu of contributions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a determination or redetermination includes a finding that an interested party committed fraud, the unemployment agency shall, in addition to sending the determination or redetermination to the interested party's address of record, ascertain from the department of state, the department of treasury, and the United States Postal Service other known mailing addresses of the interested party and send the determination or redetermination to the most recent address.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A claimant, employer, or interested party shall, during a benefit year, notify the unemployment agency of a change in its mailing address.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An appeal from a redetermination issued by the agency in accordance with section 32a or a matter transferred for hearing and decision in accordance with section 32a shall be referred to the Michigan administrative hearing system for assignment to an administrative law judge. If the agency transfers a matter, or an interested party requests a hearing before an administrative law judge on a redetermination, all matters pertinent to the claimant's benefit rights or to the liability of the employing unit under this act shall be referred to the administrative law judge. The administrative law judge shall afford all interested parties a reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing and, unless the appeal is withdrawn, the administrative law judge shall decide the rights of the interested parties and shall notify the interested parties of the decision, setting forth the findings of fact upon which the decision is based, together with the reasons for the decision. With respect to an appeal from a denial of redetermination, if the administrative law judge finds that there was good cause for the issuance of a redetermination, the denial shall be a redetermination affirming the determination and the appeal from the denial shall be an appeal from that affirmance. Unless an interested party would be unduly prejudiced, an administrative law judge may consolidate cases involving the same or substantially similar evidence or issues, hear the consolidated cases at the same date and time, create a single record of proceedings, and consider evidence introduced in 1 of those cases in the other cases. If the appellant fails to appear or prosecute the appeal, the administrative law judge may dismiss the proceedings or take other action considered advisable. An administrative law judge may, either upon application for rehearing by an interested party or on his or her own motion, proceed to rehear, affirm, modify, set aside, or reverse a prior decision on the basis of the evidence previously submitted in the case, or on the basis of additional evidence. The application or motion shall be made within 30 days after the date of mailing of the decision. The administrative law judge may, for good cause, reopen and review a prior decision and issue a new decision after the 30-day appeal period has expired. A request for review shall be made within 1 year after the date of mailing of the prior decision. An administrative law judge shall not participate in a case in which he or she has a direct or indirect interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Within 30 days after the mailing of a copy of a decision of the administrative law judge or of a denial of a motion for rehearing, an interested party may file an appeal to the Michigan compensation appellate commission, and unless such an appeal is filed, the decision or denial by the administrative law judge is final.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The Michigan compensation appellate commission created in Executive Reorganization Order No. 2011-6, MCL 445.2032, has full authority to handle, process, and decide appeals filed under section 33(2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An appeal to the Michigan compensation appellate commission from the findings of fact and decision of the administrative law judge or from a denial by the administrative law judge of a motion for a rehearing or reopening shall be a matter of right by an interested party. The Michigan compensation appellate commission, on the basis of evidence previously submitted and additional evidence as it requires, shall affirm, modify, set aside, or reverse the findings of fact and decision of the administrative law judge or a denial by the administrative law judge of a motion for rehearing or reopening.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The agency is an interested party in a matter before an administrative law judge, the Michigan compensation appellate commission, or a court, but notice of hearing is not required to be provided to the agency for a hearing before an administrative law judge or the Michigan compensation appellate commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The Michigan compensation appellate commission shall conduct an oral hearing in a matter before it only after an application for the hearing is made by an interested party and the application is approved by 2 or more members of the Michigan compensation appellate commission assigned to review the appeal. If an application for an oral hearing is not approved, the Michigan compensation appellate commission may consider a written argument if an application for written argument is approved by 2 or more members of the Michigan compensation appellate commission assigned to review the appeal and all parties are represented or all parties agree that written argument should be considered. If neither an oral hearing is held nor written argument considered, the Michigan compensation appellate commission shall decide the case on the record before the administrative law judge. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The Michigan compensation appellate commission, in its discretion, may omit the basis for its decision in cases in which it affirms the decision of an administrative law judge without alteration or modification.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The Michigan compensation appellate commission may, either upon application by an interested party for rehearing or on its own motion, proceed to rehear, affirm, modify, set aside, or reverse a prior decision on the basis of the evidence previously submitted in that case, or on the basis of additional evidence if the application or motion is made within 30 days after the date of mailing of the prior decision. The Michigan compensation appellate commission may, for good cause, reopen and review a prior decision of the Michigan compensation appellate commission and issue a new decision after the 30-day appeal period has expired, but a review shall not be made unless the request is filed with the Michigan compensation appellate commission, or review is initiated by the Michigan compensation appellate commission with notice to the interested parties, within 1 year after the date of mailing of the prior decision. Unless an interested party, within 30 days after mailing of a copy of a decision of the Michigan compensation appellate commission or of a denial of a motion for a rehearing, files an appeal from the decision or denial, or seeks judicial review as provided in section 38, the decision shall be final.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The Michigan compensation appellate commission may on its own motion affirm, modify, set aside, or reverse a decision or order of an administrative law judge on the basis of the evidence previously submitted in the case; direct the taking of additional evidence; or permit a party to the decision or order to initiate further appeals before it. The Michigan compensation appellate commission shall permit a further appeal by a party interested in a decision or order of an administrative law judge or by the Michigan compensation appellate commission if its initial ruling has been overruled or modified. The Michigan compensation appellate commission may remove to itself or direct the Michigan administrative hearing system to transfer to another administrative law judge the proceedings on appeal, rehearing, or review pending before an administrative law judge. The Michigan compensation appellate commission shall promptly notify the interested parties of its findings and decisions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A member of the Michigan compensation appellate commission may administer oaths and take depositions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The testimony at a hearing before an administrative law judge or the Michigan compensation appellate commission shall be recorded, but need not be transcribed unless requested by the majority of the panel of the Michigan compensation appellate commission assigned to hear the claim. If an interested party wants a copy of a transcript of a hearing held before an administrative law judge or the Michigan compensation appellate commission, an interested party may request and shall be provided a transcript. An interested party who requests a transcript is responsible for the cost of the transcript.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The manner in which an appeal to an administrative law judge and the Michigan compensation appellate commission shall be presented, the appeal reports required from an interested party, and the procedure governing the appeal shall be in accordance with rules promulgated by the Michigan administrative hearing system.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>421.42 “Employment” defined.</B><P>Sec. 42.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) "Employment" means service, including service in interstate commerce, performed for remuneration or under any contract of hire, written or oral, express or implied.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) "Employment" includes an individual's entire service, performed within or both within and without this state if any of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The service is localized in this state. Service shall be deemed to be localized within a state if the service is performed entirely within the state; or the service is performed both within and without the state, but the service performed without the state is incidental to the individual's service within the state, such as service which is temporary or transitory in nature or consists of isolated transactions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The service is not localized in a state but some of the service performed in this state and the base of operations, or, if there is not a base of operations, then the place from which the service is directed or controlled, is in this state; or the base of operations or place from which the service is directed or controlled is not in a state in which some part of the service is performed, but the individual's residence is in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) After December 31, 1964, the service is not localized in any state but is performed by an employee on or in connection with an American aircraft, if either the contract of service is entered into within this state or if the contract of service is not entered into within this state or within any other state and during the performance of the contract of service and while the employee is employed on the aircraft, it touches at an airfield in this state, and the employee is employed on and in connection with the aircraft when outside the United States. The unemployment agency may enter into reciprocal agreements with other states with respect to aircraft which touch airfields in more than 1 state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Service performed within this state but not covered under subsection (2) and not excluded under section 43 shall be deemed to be employment subject to this act if contributions are not required and paid with respect to those services under an unemployment compensation law of any other state or of the federal government.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Services, not covered under subsection (2), performed entirely without this state, for which contributions are not required and paid under an unemployment compensation law of any other state or of the federal government, shall be deemed to be employment subject to this act if the unemployment agency approves the election of the employer for whom the services are performed that the entire service of the individual shall be deemed to be employment subject to this act. Such an election may be canceled by the employer by filing a written notice with the unemployment agency before January 30 of any year stating the employer's desire to cancel the election or at any time by submitting to the unemployment agency satisfactory proof that the services designated in the election are covered by an unemployment compensation law of another state or of the federal government, or if the services are covered by an arrangement pursuant to section 11 between the unemployment agency and the agency charged with the administration of any other state or federal unemployment compensation law, pursuant to which all services performed by an individual for an employing unit are deemed to be performed entirely within the state, shall be deemed to be employment if the unemployment agency has approved an election of the employing unit for which the services are performed, pursuant to which the entire service of the individual during the period covered by the election is deemed to be employment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Before January 1, 2013, services performed by an individual for remuneration are not employment subject to this act, unless the individual is under the employer's control or direction as to the performance of the services both under a contract for hire and in fact. Service performed by an individual for remuneration under an exclusive contract that provides for the individual's control and direction by a person, firm, or corporation possessing a public service permit or by a certificated motor carrier transporting goods or property for hire are employment subject to this act. Service is employment under this act if it is performed by an individual who by lease, contract, or arrangement places at the disposal of a person, firm, or corporation a piece of motor vehicle equipment and under a contract of hire that provides for the individual's control and direction, is engaged by the person, firm, or corporation to operate the motor vehicle equipment. On and after January 1, 2013, services are employment if the services are performed by an individual who the agency determines to be in an employer-employee relationship using the 20-factor test announced by the internal revenue service of the United States department of treasury in revenue ruling 87-41, 1987-1 C.B. 296. An individual from whom an employer is required to withhold federal income tax is prima facie considered to perform services in employment under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Notwithstanding section 43, services performed for an employing unit, for which the employing unit is liable for federal tax against which credit may be taken for contributions required to be paid into a state unemployment compensation fund, except service performed by an individual holding a visa described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) of the immigration and nationality act, 8 USC 1101, shall be deemed to constitute employment for the purposes of this act, but only to the extent that the services constitute employment with respect to which federal tax is payable. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act or any amendatory act, services performed for an employing unit which are required to be covered under this act, as a condition for its certification by the United States secretary of labor, shall constitute employment for the purposes of this act. The unemployment agency may waive the provisions of this subsection with respect to services performed within this state if the employing unit is an employer solely by reason of section 41(7) and establishes that the services are covered by the election of the employing unit under any other state unemployment compensation law. This subsection does not apply to the exceptions provided in section 43(q).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Notwithstanding subsection (2) all service performed after December 31, 1964, by an officer or member of the crew of an American vessel on or in connection with the vessel is deemed to be employment subject to this act if the operating office, from which the operations of the vessel operating on navigable waters within, or within and without, the United States are ordinarily and regularly supervised, managed, directed, and controlled, is within this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8)(a) Service performed before January 1, 1978, by an individual in the classified civil service of this state and service performed by an individual for a school district, a community college district, a school or educational facility owned or operated by the state other than an institution of higher education, or a political subdivision of the state is employment subject to this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Service performed after December 31, 1977, in the employ of a governmental entity as defined in section 50a is employment subject to this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) "Employment" includes service performed after December 31, 1971, by an individual in the employ of this state or any of its instrumentalities for a state hospital or state institution of higher education, or in the employ of this state and 1 or more other states or their instrumentalities for a hospital or institution of higher education located in this state. Coverage of services performed for these hospitals and institutions of higher education after December 31, 1977, shall be determined pursuant to subsection (8)(b).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) "Employment" includes service performed after December 31, 1971, by an individual in the employ of a religious, charitable, educational, or other organization which is excluded from the term "employment" as defined in the federal unemployment tax act solely by reason of section 3306(c)(8) of the unemployment tax act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) "Employment" includes service performed after December 31, 1971, by an individual for his principal as an agent driver or commission driver engaged in distributing beverages, meat, vegetable, fruit, bakery, dairy, or other food products, or laundry or dry cleaning services; or as a traveling or city salesman, other than as an agent driver or commission driver, engaged upon a full-time basis in the solicitation on behalf of, and the transmission to, his principal except for sideline sales activities on behalf of some other person, of orders from wholesalers, retailers, contractors, operators of hotels, restaurants, or other similar establishments for merchandise for resale or supplies for use in their business operations. For purposes of this subsection, "employment" includes services performed after December 31, 1971, only if all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The contract of service contemplates that substantially all of the services are to be performed personally by the individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The individual does not have a substantial investment in facilities used in connection with the performance of the services other than in facilities for transportation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The services are not in the nature of a single transaction which is not part of a continuing relationship with the person for whom the services are performed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) "Employment" includes service performed by a United States citizen outside the United States after December 31, 1971, except in Canada, and in the Virgin Islands after December 31, 1971, and before January 1 of the year following the year in which the United States secretary of labor approves the unemployment compensation law of the Virgin Islands under section 3304(a) of the internal revenue code, while in the employ of an American employer and is other than service which is employment pursuant to subsection (2) or a parallel provision of another state's law, if the requirements of subdivision (a), (b), or (c) are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The employer's principal place of business in the United States is located in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The employer does not have a place of business in the United States, but the employer is any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) An individual who is a resident of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A corporation which is organized under the laws of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) A partnership or a trust and the number of the partners or trustees who are residents of this state is greater than the number who are residents of any one other state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) None of the criteria of subdivisions (a) and (b) is met but the employer elected coverage of the service under this act, or the employer failed to elect coverage in any state and the individual filed a claim for benefits based on the service under the law of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) An "American employer", for purposes of this subsection, means a person who is one of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) An individual who is a resident of the United States.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A partnership if 2/3 or more of the partners are residents of the United States.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) A trust, if all of the trustees are residents of the United States.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) A corporation organized under the laws of the United States or of any state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) As used in this subsection, "United States" includes the states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the term "employment" includes an individual's service, wherever performed within the United States, the Virgin Islands, or Canada, if the service is not covered under the unemployment compensation law of any other state, the Virgin Islands, or Canada, and the place from which the service is directed or controlled is in this state.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>421.44 “Remuneration” and “wages” defined.</B><P>Sec. 44.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) "Remuneration" means all compensation paid for personal services, including commissions and bonuses, and except for agricultural and domestic services, the cash value of all compensation payable in a medium other than cash. Any remuneration payable to an individual that has not been actually received by that individual within 21 days after the end of the pay period in which the remuneration was earned, shall, for the purposes of subsections (2) to (5) and section 46, be considered to have been paid on the twenty-first day after the end of that pay period. If back pay is awarded to an individual and is allocated by an employer or legal authority to a period of weeks within 1 or more calendar quarters, the back pay shall be considered paid in that calendar quarter or those calendar quarters for purposes of section 46. The reasonable cash value of compensation payable in a medium other than cash shall be estimated and determined in accordance with rules promulgated by the unemployment agency. Remuneration includes tips actually reported to an employer under section 6053(a) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 6053(a), by an employee who receives tip income. Remuneration does not include either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Money paid an individual by a unit of government for services rendered as a member of the National Guard of this state, or for similar services to another state or the United States.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Money paid by an employer to a worker under a supplemental unemployment benefit plan consistent with the criteria for a supplemental unemployment benefit plan as described in Internal Revenue Service publication 15-A, employer's supplemental tax guide, regardless of whether the benefits are paid from a trust or by the employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) "Wages", subject to subsections (3) to (5), means remuneration paid by employers for employment and includes tips actually reported to an employer under section 6053(a) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 6053(a), by an employee who receives tip income. If any provision of this subsection prevents this state from qualifying for any federal interest relief provisions provided under section 1202 of title XII of the social security act, 42 USC 1322, or prevents employers in this state from qualifying for the limitation on the reduction of federal unemployment tax act credits as provided under section 3302(f) of the federal unemployment tax act, 26 USC 3302, that provision is invalid to the extent necessary to maintain qualification for the interest relief provisions and federal unemployment tax credits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For the purpose of determining the amount of contributions due from an employer under this act, wages are limited by the taxable wage limit applicable under subsection (4). For this purpose, wages exclude all remuneration an employing unit pays to an individual that exceeds the taxable wage limit on which unemployment taxes were paid or were payable in this state and in any other states for that employee by the employing unit within that year. If a successor employing unit becomes a transferee during a calendar year in a transfer of business, as defined in section 22, of a predecessor employing unit and immediately after the transfer employs in his or her trade or business an individual who immediately before the transfer was employed in the trade or business of the predecessor, then for the purpose of determining whether the successor has paid remuneration with respect to employment equal to the taxable wage limit to that individual during the calendar year, any remuneration with respect to employment paid to that individual by the predecessor during the calendar year and before the transfer shall be considered as having been paid by the successor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The taxable wage limit for each calendar year is $9,500.00 in the calendar years 1986 through 2002, and $9,000.00 for calendar years after 2002 and before 2012, or the maximum amount of remuneration paid within a calendar year by an employer subject to the federal unemployment tax act, 26 USC 3301 to 3311, to an individual with respect to employment as defined in that act that is subject to tax under that act during that year for each calendar year, whichever is greater. For calendar years beginning 2012, the taxable wage limit is $9,500.00, but if at the beginning of a calendar quarter the balance in the unemployment compensation fund equals or exceeds $2,500,000,000.00 and the agency projects that the balance will remain at or above $2,500,000,000.00 for the remainder of the calendar quarter and for the entire succeeding calendar quarter, the taxable wage limit for that calendar quarter and the succeeding calendar quarter is $9,000.00 for an employer that is not delinquent in the payment of unemployment contributions, penalties, or interest. For calendar years beginning 2016, if on June 30 of the preceding year the balance in the unemployment compensation fund equals or exceeds $2,500,000,000.00 and the agency projects that the balance will remain at or above $2,500,000,000.00 for the succeeding calendar quarter, the taxable wage limit for the calendar year is reduced to $9,000.00 for an employer that is not delinquent in the payment of unemployment contributions, penalties, or interest. If the unemployment compensation fund balance on June 30 or the agency projection does not meet these conditions, the $9,500.00 taxable wage limit applies to all employers in the next calendar year. For purposes of this subsection, an employer is delinquent in the payment of unemployment contribution, penalties, or interest if the employer has a quarterly unpaid balance of $25.00 or more, unless 1 or more of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The employer has filed a timely protest or appeal of the notice of assessment and the assessment has not become final.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Within 45 days after the beginning of the first calendar quarter in which the reduced taxable wage base limit takes effect for nondelinquent employers, all outstanding balances owed to the unemployment agency are paid in full.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the employer is a domestic employer, all applicable contributions, interest, and penalties are paid on or before the date specified by the agency under section 13(1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) For the purposes of this act, the term "wages" does not include any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The amount of a payment, including an amount paid by an employer for insurance or annuities or into a fund, to provide for such a payment, made to, or on behalf of, an employee or any of the employee's dependents under a plan or system established by an employer that makes provision for the employer's employees generally, or for the employer's employees generally and their dependents, or for a class or classes of the employer's employees, or for a class or classes of the employer's employees and their dependents, on account of retirement, sickness or accident disability, medical or hospitalization expenses in connection with sickness or accident disability, or death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A payment made to an employee, including an amount paid by an employer for insurance or annuities, or into a fund, to provide for such a payment, on account of retirement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A payment on account of sickness or accident disability, or medical or hospitalization expenses in connection with sickness or accident disability, made by an employer to, or on behalf of, an employee after the expiration of 6 calendar months following the last calendar month in which the employee worked for the employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A payment made to, or on behalf of, an employee or the employee's beneficiary from or to a trust described in section 401(a) of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 401(a), that is exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 501(a), at the time of the payment, unless the payment is made to an employee of the trust as remuneration for services rendered as an employee and not as a beneficiary of the trust, or under or to an annuity plan which, at the time of the payment, is a plan described in section 403(a) of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 403(a), or under or to a bond purchase plan that at the time of the payment, is a qualified bond purchase plan described in former section 405(a) of the internal revenue code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The payment by an employer, without deduction from the remuneration of the employee, of the tax imposed upon an employee under section 3101 of the federal insurance contributions act, 26 USC 3101.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Remuneration paid in any medium other than cash to an employee for service not in the course of the employer's trade or business.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) A payment, other than vacation or sick pay, made to an employee after the month in which the employee attains the age of 65, if the employee did not work for the employer in the period for which the payment is made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Remuneration paid to or on behalf of an employee as moving expenses if, and to the extent that, at the time of payment of the remuneration it is reasonable to believe that a corresponding deduction is allowable under section 217 of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 217.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Subject to subsections (d) through (f), for benefit years beginning before October 1, 2000, "benefit year" means the period of 52 consecutive calendar weeks beginning the first calendar week in which an individual files a claim in accordance with section 32 and meets all of the following conditions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The individual has earned 20 credit weeks in the 52 consecutive calendar weeks before the week he or she files the claim for benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The individual is unemployed and meets all requirements of section 28 for the week for which he or she files a claim for benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except for a disqualification under section 29 (8) involving a labor dispute during the individual's most recent period of employment with the most recent employer with whom the individual earned a credit week, the individual is not disqualified or subject to disqualification for the week for which he or she files a claim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The individual does not have a benefit year already in effect at the time of the claim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For benefit years beginning on or after October 1, 2000, "benefit year" means the period of 52 consecutive calendar weeks beginning the first calendar week in which an individual files a claim in accordance with section 32. However, a benefit year shall not be established unless the individual meets either of the following conditions: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The total wages paid to the individual in the base period of the claim equals not less than 1.5 times the wages paid to the individual in the calendar quarter of the base period in which the individual was paid the highest wages. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The individual was paid wages in 2 or more calendar quarters of the base period totaling at least 20 times the state average weekly wage as determined by the unemployment agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For benefit years beginning after October 1, 2000, the state average weekly wage for a calendar year shall be computed on the basis of the 12 months ending the June 30 preceding that calendar year. A benefit year shall not be established if the individual was not paid wages of at least the state minimum hourly wage multiplied by 388.06 rounded down to the nearest dollar in at least 1 calendar quarter of the base period. A benefit year shall not be established based on base period wages previously used to establish a benefit year that resulted in the payment of benefits. However, if a calendar quarter of the base period contains wages that were previously used to establish a benefit year that resulted in the payment of benefits, a claimant may establish a benefit year using the wages in the remaining calendar quarters from among the first 4 of the last 5 completed calendar quarters, or if a benefit year cannot be established using those quarters, then by using wages from among the last 4 completed calendar quarters. A benefit year shall not be established unless, after the beginning of the immediately preceding benefit year during which the individual received benefits, the individual worked and received remuneration in an amount equal to at least 5 times the individual's most recent state weekly benefit rate in effect during the individual's immediately preceding benefit year. If a quarterly wage report has not been submitted in a timely manner by the employer as provided in section 13 for any of the quarters of the base period, or if wage information is not available for use by the unemployment agency for the most recent completed calendar quarter, the unemployment agency shall obtain and use the claimant's statement of wages paid during the calendar quarters for which the wage reports are missing to establish a benefit year. However, the claimant's statement of wages shall only be used to establish a benefit year if the claimant also provides to the unemployment agency documentary or other evidence of those wages that is satisfactory to the unemployment agency. A determination based on the claimant's statement of wages paid during any of these calendar quarters shall be redetermined if the quarterly wage report from the employer is later received and would result in a change in the claimant's weekly benefit amount or duration, or both, or if the quarterly wage report from the employer later becomes available for use by the unemployment agency and would result in a change in the claimant's benefit amount or duration, or both. If the redetermination results from the employer's failure to submit the quarterly wage report in a timely manner, the redetermination shall be effective as to benefits payable for weeks beginning after the receipt of information not previously submitted by the employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If an individual files a claim for a 7-day period under section 27(c), his or her benefit year begins the calendar week containing the first day of that 7-day period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If all or part of a claimant's right to benefits during his or her benefit year is canceled under section 62(b), the benefit year is terminated on the effective date of the cancellation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) An individual may request a redetermination of his or her benefit rights and cancellation of a previously established benefit year if he or she has not completed a compensable period. Under circumstances described in this subsection, the benefit year begins the first day of the first week in which the request for redetermination of benefit rights is duly filed.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 46a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If an individual is not able to establish a benefit year under section 46 because of insufficient credit weeks, a benefit year may be established under this section if the individual has at least 14 credit weeks in his or her base period, and has base period wages in excess of 20 times the state average weekly wage, applicable to the calendar year in which the individual's benefit year is established, as computed under section 27(b)(2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   With respect to a benefit year established under this section, an individual's average weekly wage shall be calculated by dividing the claimant's base period wages by 20. The resultant quotient will be the individual's average weekly wage for purposes of establishing the individual's weekly benefit rate under section 27. Notwithstanding section 27(d), for benefit years established under this section the individual will be entitled to 15 full weekly benefit payments at the established weekly benefit rate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Employers will be charged for benefits paid under this section based upon the ratio of wages earned with each employer to the total base period wages earned by the claimant. This ratio will be multiplied by the weekly benefit rate calculated for the claimant, and the resultant product will be the weekly charge to the employer's account.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   When payable pursuant to section 64, 7-1/2 full week payments of extended benefits will be paid at the weekly benefit rate established under this section to a claimant who exhausts his or her entitlement to the regular weekly benefits established under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A claim established under this section is subject to all provisions of this act which are not in conflict with this section.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An individual shall be considered unemployed for any week during which he or she performs no services and for which remuneration is not payable to the individual, or for any week of less than full-time work if the remuneration payable to the individual is less than 1-1/2 times his or her weekly benefit rate, except that for payable weeks of benefits beginning after the effective date of the amendatory act that added section 15a and before October 1, 2015, an individual is considered unemployed for any week or less of full-time work if the remuneration payable to the individual is less than 1-3/5 times his or her weekly benefit rate. However, any loss of remuneration incurred by an individual during any week resulting from any cause other than the failure of the individual's employing unit to furnish full-time, regular employment shall be included as remuneration earned for purposes of this section and section 27(c). The total amount of remuneration lost shall be determined pursuant to regulations prescribed by the unemployment agency. For the purposes of this act, an individual's weekly benefit rate means the weekly benefit rate determined pursuant to section 27(b).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) All amounts paid to a claimant by an employing unit or former employing unit for a vacation or a holiday, and amounts paid in the form of retroactive pay, pay in lieu of notice, severance payments, salary continuation, or other remuneration intended by the employing unit as continuing wages or other monetary consideration as the result of the separation, excluding SUB payments as described in section 44, shall be considered remuneration in determining whether an individual is unemployed under this section and also in determining his or her benefit payments under section 27(c), for the period designated by the contract or agreement providing for the payment, or if there is no contractual specification of the period to which payments shall be allocated, then for the period designated by the employing unit or former employing unit. However, payments for a vacation or holiday, or the right to which has irrevocably vested, after 14 days following a vacation or holiday shall not be considered wages or remuneration within the meaning of this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An individual shall not be considered to be unemployed during any leave of absence from work granted by an employer either at the request of the individual or pursuant to an agreement with the individual's duly authorized bargaining agent, or in accordance with law. An individual shall neither be considered not unemployed nor on a leave of absence solely because the individual elects to be laid off, pursuant to an option provided under a collective bargaining agreement or written employer plan that permits an election, if there is a temporary layoff because of lack of work and the employer has consented to the election. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, with respect to claims for weeks of benefits beginning before April 1, 2021, an individual on a leave of absence because the individual self-isolated or self-quarantined in response to elevated risk from COVID-19 because he or she is immunocompromised, displayed a commonly recognized principal symptom of COVID-19 that was not otherwise associated with a known medical or physical condition of the individual, had contact in the last 14 days with an individual with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, or needed to care for an individual with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, may be considered to be unemployed unless the individual is already on sick leave or receives a disability benefit.</div>

Deduction from benefits or wages payable to the individual is limited to not more than 50% of each payment due the claimant. The unemployment agency shall issue a determination requiring restitution within 3 years after the date of finality of a determination, redetermination, or decision reversing a previous finding of benefit entitlement. Except in the case of benefits improperly paid because of suspected identity fraud, the unemployment agency shall not initiate administrative or court action to recover improperly paid benefits from an individual more than 3 years after the date that the last determination, redetermination, or decision establishing restitution is final. Except in the case of benefits improperly paid because of suspected identity fraud, the unemployment agency shall issue a restitution determination on an issue within 3 years from the date the claimant first received benefits in the benefit year in which the issue arose, or in the case of an issue of intentional false statement, misrepresentation, or concealment of material information in violation of section 54(a) or (b) or sections 54a to 54c, within 3 years after the receipt of the improperly paid benefits unless the unemployment agency filed a civil action in a court within the 3-year period; the individual made an intentional false statement, misrepresentation, or concealment of material information to obtain the benefits; or the unemployment agency issued a determination requiring restitution within the 3-year period. The time limits in this section do not prohibit the unemployment agency from pursuing collection methods to recover the amounts found to have been improperly paid. Except in a case of an intentional false statement, misrepresentation, or concealment of material information, the unemployment agency shall waive recovery of an improperly paid benefit if repayment would be contrary to equity and good conscience and shall waive any interest. If the agency or an appellate authority waives collection of restitution and interest, except as provided in subdivision (ii), the waiver is prospective and does not apply to restitution and interest payments already made by the individual. As used in this subsection, "contrary to equity and good conscience" means any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The claimant provided incorrect wage information without the intent to misrepresent, and the employer provided either no wage information upon request or provided inaccurate wage information that resulted in the overpayment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The claimant's average net household income and household cash assets, exclusive of social welfare benefits, were, during the 6 months immediately preceding the date of the application for waiver, at or below 150% of the annual update of the poverty guidelines most recently published in the Federal Register by the United States Department of Health and Human Services under the authority of 42 USC 9902(2), and the claimant has applied for a waiver under this subsection. The unemployment agency shall not consider a new application for a waiver from a claimant within 6 months after receiving an application for a waiver from the claimant. A waiver granted under the conditions described in this subdivision applies from the date the application is filed. If the waiver is granted, the unemployment agency shall promptly refund any restitution or interest payments made by the individual after the date of the application for waiver. As used in this subdivision:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) "Cash assets" means cash on hand and funds in a checking or savings account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) "Dependent" means that term as defined in section 27(b)(4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(C) "Household" means a claimant and the claimant's dependents.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The improper payments resulted from an administrative or clerical error by the unemployment agency. A requirement to repay benefits as the result of a change in judgment at any level of administrative adjudication or court decision concerning the facts or application of law to a claim adjudication is not an administrative or clerical error for purposes of this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the unemployment agency determines that a claimant has intentionally made a false statement or misrepresentation or has concealed material information to obtain benefits, whether or not the claimant obtains benefits by or because of the intentional false statement, misrepresentation, or concealment of material information, the unemployment agency shall, in addition to any other applicable interest and penalties, cancel his or her rights to benefits for the benefit year in which the act occurred as of the date the claimant made the false statement or misrepresentation or concealed material information, and shall not use wages used to establish that benefit year to establish another benefit year. A chargeable employer may protest a claim filed after October 1, 2014 to establish a successive benefit year under section 46(c), if there was a determination by the unemployment agency or decision of a court or administrative tribunal finding that the claimant made a false statement, made a misrepresentation, or concealed material information related to his or her report of earnings for a preceding benefit year claim. If a protest is made, the unemployment agency shall not use any unreported earnings from the preceding benefit year that were falsely stated, misrepresented, or concealed to establish a benefit year for a successive claim. Before receiving benefits in a benefit year established within 4 years after cancellation of rights to benefits under this subsection, the claimant, in addition to making the restitution of benefits established under subsection (a), may be liable for an additional amount as otherwise determined by the unemployment agency under this act, which may be paid by cash, deduction from benefits, or deduction from a tax refund. The claimant is liable for any fee the federal government imposes with respect to instituting a deduction from a federal tax refund. Restitution resulting from the intentional false statement, misrepresentation, or concealment of material information is not subject to the 50% limitation provided in subsection (a).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Any determination made by the unemployment agency under this section is final unless an application for a redetermination is filed in accordance with section 32a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The unemployment agency shall take the action necessary to recover all benefits improperly obtained or paid under this act, and to enforce all interest and penalties under subsection (b). The unemployment agency may conduct an amnesty program for a designated period under which penalties and interest assessed against an individual owing restitution for improperly paid benefits may be waived if the individual pays the full amount of restitution owing within the period specified by the agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Interest recovered under this section must be deposited in the contingent fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The unemployment agency shall not make a determination that a claimant made an intentional false statement, misrepresentation, or concealment of material information that is subject to sanctions under this section based solely on a computer-identified discrepancy in information supplied by the claimant or employer. An unemployment agency employee or agent must examine the facts and independently determine that the claimant or the employer is responsible for a willful or intentional violation before the agency makes a determination under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) By January 31 each year, beginning in 2019, the unemployment agency shall provide a written report regarding waivers under subsection (a)(ii) to the chairpersons of the standing committees and the appropriations subcommittees of the house of representatives and senate having jurisdiction over legislation pertaining to employment security. The report must include all of the following information from the immediately preceding calendar year in a form that does not identify an individual, claimant, or employer:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The procedures relating to waivers that the unemployment agency used or adopted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The number of applications for a waiver the unemployment agency received.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The number of individuals who submitted an application for a waiver.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The number of waivers that were granted by each of the following methods:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) An unemployment agency determination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) An unemployment agency redetermination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(C) An administrative law judge order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(D) A Michigan compensation appellate commission order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(E) A court order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) The number of waivers that were denied, tabulated by the reason for the denial, by each of the following methods:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) An unemployment agency determination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) An unemployment agency redetermination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(C) An administrative law judge order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(D) A Michigan compensation appellate commission order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(E) A court order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) The total amount of restitution waived.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>421.64 Payment of extended benefits.</B><P>Sec. 64.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1)(a) Payment of extended benefits under this section shall be made at the individual's weekly extended benefit rate, for any week of unemployment that begins in the individual's eligibility period, to each individual who is fully eligible and not disqualified under this act, who has exhausted all rights to regular benefits under this act, who is not seeking or receiving benefits with respect to that week under the unemployment compensation law of Canada, and who does not have rights to benefits under the unemployment compensation law of any other state or the United States or to compensation or allowances under any other federal law, such as the trade expansion act, the automotive products trade act, or the railroad unemployment insurance act; however, if the individual is seeking benefits and the appropriate agency finally determines that the individual is not entitled to benefits under another law, the individual shall be considered to have exhausted the right to benefits. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, an individual shall have exhausted the right to regular benefits under this section with respect to any week of unemployment in the individual's eligibility period under either of the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) When payments of regular benefits may not be made for that week because the individual has received all regular benefits available based on his or her employment or wages during the base period for the current benefit year. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) When the right to the benefits has terminated before that week by reason of the expiration or termination of the benefit year with respect to which the right existed; and the individual has no, or insufficient, wages or employment to establish a new benefit year. However, for purposes of this subsection, an individual shall be considered to have exhausted the right to regular benefits with respect to any week of unemployment in his or her eligibility period when the individual may become entitled to regular benefits with respect to that week or future weeks, but the benefits are not payable at the time the individual claims extended benefits because final action on a pending redetermination or on an appeal has not yet been taken with respect to eligibility or qualification for the regular benefits or when the individual may be entitled to regular benefits with respect to future weeks of unemployment, but regular benefits are not payable with respect to any week of unemployment in his or her eligibility period by reason of seasonal limitations in any state unemployment compensation law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Except where inconsistent with the provisions of this section, the terms and conditions of this act that apply to claims for regular benefits and to the payment of those benefits apply to claims for extended benefits and to the payment of those benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An individual shall not be paid additional compensation and extended compensation with respect to the same week. If an individual is potentially eligible for both types of compensation in this state with respect to the same week, the unemployment agency may pay extended compensation instead of additional compensation with respect to the week. If an individual is potentially eligible for extended compensation in 1 state and potentially eligible for additional compensation for the same week in another state, the individual may elect which of the 2 types of compensation to claim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The unemployment agency shall establish, for each eligible individual who files an application, an extended benefit account with respect to that individual's benefit year. The amount established in the account shall be determined as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If subdivision (b) or (c) does not apply, whichever of the following is smaller:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Fifty percent of the total amount of regular benefits payable to the individual under this act during the benefit year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Thirteen times the individual's weekly extended benefit rate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) With respect to a week beginning in a period in which the average rate of total unemployment as described in subsection (5)(c)(ii) equals or exceeds 8%, but no later than the end of the week in which extended benefits payable under this section cease to be funded 100% by the federal government, whichever of the following is smaller:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Eighty percent of the total amount of regular benefits payable to the individual under this act during the benefit year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Twenty times the individual's weekly extended benefit rate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>If an amount determined under this subsection is not an exact multiple of 1/2 of the individual's weekly extended benefit rate, the amount shall be decreased to the next lower such multiple.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) All of the following apply to an extended benefit period:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The period begins with the third week after whichever of the following weeks first occurs:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A week for which there is a national "on" indicator as determined by the United States Secretary of Labor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A week for which there is a Michigan "on" indicator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The period ends with the third week after the first week for which there is both a national "off" indicator and a Michigan "off" indicator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The period is at least 13 consecutive weeks long, and does not begin by reason of a Michigan "on" indicator before the fourteenth week after the close of a prior extended benefit period under this section. However, an extended benefit period terminates with the week preceding the week for which no extended benefit payments are considered to be shareable compensation under the federal-state extended unemployment compensation act of 1970, section 3304 nt of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 3304 nt.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An individual's "eligibility period" consists of the weeks in his or her benefit year that begin in an extended benefit period, and if his or her benefit year ends within the extended benefit period, any weeks thereafter that begin in the period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) (a) With respect to weeks beginning after September 25, 1982, a national "on" indicator for a week shall be determined by the United States Secretary of Labor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A national "off" indicator for a week shall be determined by the United States Secretary of Labor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) There is a Michigan "on" indicator for a week if 1 or both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The rate of insured unemployment under this act for the period consisting of that week and the immediately preceding 12 weeks equaled or exceeded 120% of the average of the insured unemployment rates for the corresponding 13-week period ending in each of the preceding 2 calendar years, and equaled or exceeded 5%. With respect to compensation for each week of unemployment beginning after December 17, 2010 and ending December 31, 2011, the rate of insured unemployment under this act for the period consisting of that week and the immediately preceding 12 weeks equaled or exceeded 120% of the average of the insured unemployment rates for the corresponding 13-week period ending in each of the preceding 3 calendar years, and equaled or exceeded 5%.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) For weeks beginning after December 17, 2010 and ending with the week ending 4 weeks before the last week of unemployment for which 100% federal funding is available for extended benefits, the average rate of total unemployment in this state, seasonally adjusted, as determined by the United States Secretary of Labor, for the period consisting of the most recent 3 months for which data for all states are published before the close of the week equaled or exceeded both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) Six and one-half percent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) One hundred ten percent of the average rate of total unemployment in this state, seasonally adjusted, for the period consisting of the corresponding 3-month period in any or all of the preceding 2 calendar years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) There is a Michigan "off" indicator for a week if, for the period consisting of that week and the immediately preceding 12 weeks, either subdivision (c)(i) or (c)(ii) was not satisfied. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, if this state is in a period in which temporary extended unemployment compensation is payable in this state under title II of the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002, Public Law 107-147, or another similar federal law, and if the governor has the authority under that federal act or another similar federal law, then the governor may elect to trigger "off" the Michigan indicator for extended benefits under this act only for a period in which temporary extended unemployment compensation is payable in this state, if the election by the governor would not result in a decrease in the number of weeks of unemployment benefits payable to an individual under this act or under federal law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) For purposes of subdivisions (c) and (d), the rate of insured unemployment for any 13-week period shall be determined by reference to the average monthly covered employment under this act for the first 4 of the most recent 6 calendar quarters ending before the close of that period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) As used in this subsection, "rate of insured unemployment" means the percentage determined by dividing:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The average weekly number of individuals filing claims for regular benefits for weeks of unemployment with respect to the specified period as determined on the basis of the reports made by all state agencies or, in the case of subdivisions (c) and (d), by the unemployment agency, to the federal government; by</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) In the case of subdivisions (c) and (d), the average monthly covered employment under this act for the specified period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Calculations under subdivisions (c) and (d) shall be made by the unemployment agency and shall conform to regulations, if any, prescribed by the United States Secretary of Labor under section 3304 nt of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 3304 nt.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Regular benefits" means benefits payable to an individual under this act and, unless otherwise expressly provided, under any other state unemployment compensation law, including unemployment benefits payable pursuant to 5 USC 8501 to 8525, other than extended benefits, and other than additional benefits which includes training benefits under section 27(g).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Extended benefits" means benefits, including additional benefits and unemployment benefits payable pursuant to 5 USC 8501 to 8525, payable for weeks of unemployment beginning in an extended benefit period to an individual as provided under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Additional benefits" means benefits totally financed by a state and payable to exhaustees by reason of conditions of high unemployment or by reason of other special factors under the provisions of any state law as well as training benefits paid under section 27(g) with respect to an extended benefit period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Weekly extended benefit rate" means an amount equal to the amount of regular benefits payable under this act to an individual within the individual's benefit year for a week of total unemployment, unless the individual had more than 1 weekly extended benefit rate within that benefit year, in which case the individual's weekly extended benefit rate shall be computed by dividing the maximum amount of regular benefits payable under this act within that benefit year by the number of weeks for which benefits were payable, adjusted to the next lower multiple of $1.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) "Benefits payable" includes all benefits computed in accordance with section 27(d), irrespective of whether the individual was otherwise eligible for the benefits within his or her current benefit year and irrespective of any benefit reduction by reason of a disqualification that required a reduction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1)(b), an individual is ineligible for payment of extended benefits for any week of unemployment if the unemployment agency finds that during that period either of the following occurred:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The individual failed to accept any offer of suitable work or failed to apply for any suitable work to which the individual was referred by the unemployment agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The individual failed to actively engage in seeking work as described in subdivision (f).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Any individual who has been found ineligible for extended benefits under subdivision (a) shall also be denied benefits beginning with the first day of the week following the week in which the failure occurred and until the individual has been employed in each of 4 subsequent weeks, whether or not consecutive, and has earned remuneration equal to not less than 4 times the extended weekly benefit amount, as determined under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) As used in this subsection, "suitable work" means, with respect to any individual, any work that is within that individual's capabilities, if both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The gross weekly remuneration payable for the work exceeds the sum of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) The individual's extended weekly benefit amount as determined under subsection (2). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) The amount, if any, of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits, as defined in section 501(c)(17)(D) of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 501(c)(17)(D), payable to the individual for that week. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The employer pays wages not less than the higher of the minimum wage provided by section 6(a)(1) of the fair labor standards act of 1938, 29 USC 206(a)(1), without regard to any exemption, or the applicable state or local minimum wage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) An individual shall not be denied extended benefits for failure to accept an offer of, or apply for, any job that meets the definition of suitable work in subdivision (c) if 1 or more of the following are true:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The position was not offered to the individual in writing and was not listed with the state employment service. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The failure could not result in a denial of benefits under the definition of suitable work in section 29(6) to the extent that the criteria of suitability in that section are not inconsistent with the provisions of subdivision (c). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The individual furnishes satisfactory evidence to the unemployment agency that his or her prospects for obtaining work in his or her customary occupation within a reasonably short period are good. If that evidence is deemed satisfactory for this purpose, the determination of whether any work is suitable with respect to that individual shall be made in accordance with the definition of suitable work in section 29(6) without regard to the definition in subdivision (c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Notwithstanding subsection (1)(b), work is not suitable work for an individual if the work does not meet the labor standard provisions required by section 3304(a)(5) of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 3304(a)(5), and section 29(7). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) For the purposes of subdivision (a)(ii), an individual is actively engaged in seeking work during any week if both of the following are true:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The individual has engaged in a systematic and sustained effort to obtain work during that week. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The individual furnishes tangible evidence to the unemployment agency that he or she has engaged in a systematic and sustained effort during that week.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The unemployment agency shall refer any applicant for extended benefits to any suitable work that meets the criteria prescribed in subdivisions (c) and (d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) An individual is not eligible to receive extended benefits with respect to any week of unemployment in his or her eligibility period if that individual has been disqualified for benefits under this act because he or she voluntarily left work, was discharged for misconduct, or failed to accept an offer of or apply for suitable work unless the individual requalified in accordance with a specific provision of this act requiring that the individual be employed subsequent to the week in which the act or discharge occurred that caused the disqualification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) (a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), payment of extended benefits shall not be made to any individual for any week of unemployment that otherwise would have been payable pursuant to an interstate claim filed in any state under the interstate benefit payment plan, if an extended benefit period is not in effect for the week in the state in which the interstate claim is filed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Subdivision (a) does not apply with respect to the first 2 weeks for which extended benefits are payable, pursuant to an interstate claim, to the individual from the extended benefit account established for the individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1)(b), an individual who established a benefit year under section 46 on or after January 2, 1983, shall be eligible to receive extended benefits only if the individual earned wages in an amount exceeding 40 times the individual's most recent weekly benefit rate during the base period of the benefit year that is used to establish the individual's extended benefit account under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) This subsection is effective for weeks of unemployment beginning after October 30, 1982. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an individual's extended benefit entitlement, with respect to weeks of unemployment beginning after the end of the benefit year, shall be reduced, but not below zero, by the product of the number of weeks for which the individual received any amounts of trade readjustment allowances, paid under the trade act of 1974, Public Law 93-618, within that benefit year, multiplied by the individual's weekly benefit amount for extended benefits.</div>
