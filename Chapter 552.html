<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In every action brought, either for a divorce or for a separation, the court may require either party to pay alimony for the suitable maintenance of the adverse party, to pay such sums as shall be deemed proper and necessary to conserve any real or personal property owned by the parties or either of them, and to pay any sums necessary to enable the adverse party to carry on or defend the action, during its pendency. It may award costs against either party and award execution for the same, or it may direct such costs to be paid out of any property sequestered, or in the power of the court, or in the hands of a receiver.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An award of alimony may be terminated by the court as of the date the party receiving alimony remarries unless a contrary agreement is specifically stated in the judgment of divorce. Termination of an award under this subsection shall not affect alimony payments which have accrued prior to that termination.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Upon the hearing of the complaint, in the manner of a motion, the court may enter an order as it determines proper for the support of the petitioner and the minor child or children of the parties as prescribed in section 5 of the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.605. The order shall provide that payment shall be made to the friend of the court or the state disbursement unit. If the parent complained of opposes the entry of the order upon the ground that he or she is without sufficient financial ability to provide necessary shelter, food, care, clothing, and other support for his or her spouse and child or children, the burden of proving this lack of ability is on the parent against whom the complaint is made. The order shall state in separate paragraphs the amount of support for the petitioner until the further order of the court, and the amount of support for each child until each child reaches 18 years of age or until the further order of the court. Subject to section 5b of the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.605b, the court may also order support for the child after the child reaches 18 years of age, or until the further order of the court. Support ordered may include expenses of medical, dental, and other health care, child care, and education, necessary medical expenses incurred in connection with the mother's pregnancy or the birth of the child, and the expense of genetic testing. A child support obligation is only retroactive to the date that the complaint for support was filed unless any of the following circumstances exist:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The defendant was avoiding service of process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The defendant threatened or coerced through domestic violence or other means the complainant not to file a proceeding under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The defendant otherwise delayed the imposition of a support obligation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The court shall order medical expenses incurred in connection with the mother's pregnancy or the birth of the child under this section in the same manner as medical expenses are ordered under section 2 of the paternity act, 1956 PA 205, MCL 722.712, and shall include in its order provisions as required by that section for orders entered under that act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A support order entered under this section is enforceable as provided in the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.601 to 552.650. If this act contains a specific provision regarding the contents or enforcement of a child support order that conflicts with a provision in the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.601 to 552.650, this act controls in regard to that provision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If there is no dispute regarding a child's custody, the court shall include in an order for support issued under this act specific provisions governing custody of and parenting time for the child in accordance with the child custody act of 1970, 1970 PA 91, MCL 722.21 to 722.31. If there is a dispute regarding custody of and parenting time for the child, the court shall include in an order for support issued under this act specific temporary provisions governing custody of and parenting time for the child. Pending a hearing on or other resolution of the dispute, the court may refer the matter to the office of the friend of the court for a written report and recommendation as provided in section 5 of the friend of the court act, 1982 PA 294, MCL 552.505. In a dispute regarding custody of and parenting time for a child, the prosecuting attorney is not required to represent either party regarding the dispute.</div>

An amount shall not be charged under this subsection if the investigation was not requested by either party. If the court determines that a request by a party that led to the investigation was frivolous, the court may order that the amount be charged only against the party, but the amount shall not be charged against the other party. Money collected under this subsection shall be deposited in the county friend of the court fund created under section 2530 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.2530.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as required by this section, an office of the friend of the court shall open and maintain a friend of the court case for a domestic relations matter. If there is an open friend of the court case for a domestic relations matter, the office of the friend of the court shall administer and enforce the obligations of the parties to the friend of the court case as provided in this act. If there is not an open friend of the court case for a domestic relations matter, the office of the friend of the court shall not administer or enforce an obligation of a party to the domestic relations matter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The parties to a domestic relations matter are not required to have a friend of the court case opened or maintained for their domestic relations matter. With their initial pleadings, the parties to a domestic relations matter may file a motion for the court to order the office of the friend of the court not to open a friend of the court case for the domestic relations matter. If the parties to a domestic relations matter file a motion under this subsection, the court shall issue that order unless the court determines 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A party to the domestic relations matter is eligible for title IV-D services because of the party's current or past receipt of public assistance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A party to the domestic relations matter applies for title IV-D services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A party to the domestic relations matter requests that the office of the friend of the court open and maintain a friend of the court case for the domestic relations matter, even though the party may not be eligible for title IV-D services because the domestic relations matter involves, by way of example and not limitation, only spousal support, child custody, parenting time, or child custody and parenting time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) There exists in the domestic relations matter evidence of domestic violence or uneven bargaining positions and evidence that a party to the domestic relations matter has chosen not to apply for title IV-D services against the best interest of either the party or the party's child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The parties have not filed with the court a document, signed by each party, that includes a list of the friend of the court services and an acknowledgment that the parties are choosing to do without those services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a friend of the court case is not opened for a domestic relations matter, the parties to the domestic relations matter have full responsibility for administration and enforcement of the obligations imposed in the domestic relations matter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The parties to a friend of the court case may file a motion for the court to order the office of the friend of the court to close their friend of the court case. The court shall issue an order that the office of the friend of the court shall close the friend of the court case unless the court determines 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A party to the friend of the court case objects.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A party to the friend of the court case is eligible for title IV-D services because the party is receiving public assistance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A party to the friend of the court case is eligible for title IV-D services because the party received public assistance and an arrearage is owed to the governmental entity that provided the public assistance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The friend of the court case record shows that, within the previous 12 months, a child support arrearage or custody or parenting time order violation has occurred in the case.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Within the previous 12 months, a party to the friend of the court case has reopened a friend of the court case.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) There exists in the friend of the court case evidence of domestic violence or uneven bargaining positions and evidence that a party to the friend of the court case has chosen to close the case against the best interest of either the party or the party's child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The parties have not filed with the court a document, signed by each party, that includes a list of the friend of the court services and an acknowledgment that the parties are choosing to do without those services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The closure of a friend of the court case does not release a party from the party's obligations imposed in the underlying domestic relations matter. The parties to a closed friend of the court case assume full responsibility for administration and enforcement of obligations imposed in the underlying domestic relations matter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a party to the underlying domestic relations matter wants to ensure that child support payments made after a friend of the court case is closed will be taken into account in any possible future office of the friend of the court enforcement action, the child support payments must be made through the SDU. If the parties choose to continue to have child support payments made through the SDU, the office of the friend of the court shall not close its friend of the court case until each party provides the SDU with the information necessary to process the child support payments required in the underlying domestic relations matter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a party to a domestic relations matter for which there is not an open friend of the court case applies for services from the office of the friend of the court or applies for public assistance, the office of the friend of the court shall open or reopen a friend of the court case. If the office of the friend of the court opens or reopens a friend of the court case as required by this subsection, the court shall issue an order in that domestic relations matter that contains the provisions required by this act and by the support and parenting time enforcement act for a friend of the court case. The court may direct the party making the application or the friend of the court to prepare a written order and submit it for approval.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the parties to a domestic relations matter file a motion under subsection (2) or (4), the friend of the court shall advise the parties in writing as to the services that the office of the friend of the court is not required to provide. The state court administrative office shall develop and make available a form for use by an office of the friend of the court under this subsection and a document for use by parties to a domestic relations matter under subsection (2) or (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) For purposes of this section, a party receives public assistance if the party receives cash assistance provided under the social welfare act, 1939 PA 280, MCL 400.1 to 400.119b, medical assistance, or food assistance or if foster care is being or was provided to a child who is the subject of the case.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The parent against whom the complaint is directed is obligated to pay the child's uninsured health care expenses, a demand for payment of the uninsured portion was made to that parent within 28 days after the insurers' final payment or denial of coverage, and that parent did not pay the uninsured portion within 28 days after the demand.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the state court administrative office, under the supervision and direction of the supreme court, establishes a minimum threshold for the enforcement of health care expenses, the health care expense is equal to or greater than the established threshold.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If, within 21 days after the complaint and notice are sent to a parent under subsection (2), the parent does not file with the office a written objection to the complaint, the amount of the health care expense stated in the complaint becomes a support arrearage and is subject to any enforcement process available to collect a support arrearage. If the parent files a written objection within the 21-day time limit, the office shall set a court hearing, before a judge or referee, to resolve the complaint.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) After a final judgment containing a child support order has been entered in a friend of the court case, the office shall use a procedure provided in section 17b to periodically review the order, as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If a child is being supported in whole or in part by public assistance, not less than once every 36 months unless both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The office receives notice from the department that good cause exists not to proceed with support action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Neither party has requested a review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Upon receipt of a written request from either party. Within 14 days after receipt of the review request, the office shall determine whether the order is due for review. The office is not required to act on more than 1 request received from a party every 36 months.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If a child is receiving medical assistance, not less than once every 36 months unless either of the following applies:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The order requires providing health care coverage for the child and neither party has requested a review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The office receives notice from the department that good cause exists not to proceed with support action and neither party has requested a review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If requested by the initiating state for a recipient of services in that state under title IV-D, not less than once each 36 months. Within 14 days after receipt of a review request, the office must determine whether an order is due for review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) At the direction of the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) At the initiative of the office, if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the amount of child support awarded in the judgment should be modified or that dependent health care coverage should be modified, or both. Reasonable grounds to review an order under this subdivision include any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Temporary or permanent changes in the physical custody of a child that the court has not ordered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Increased or decreased need of the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Probable access by a parent to dependent health care coverage that is accessible to the child and available at a reasonable cost. Health care coverage is presumed accessible to the child and presumed available at a reasonable cost if it meets the guidelines provided in the child support formula developed by the bureau under section 19.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Changed dependent health care coverage cost from the amount used in the previous child support order. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Changed financial conditions of a recipient of support or a payer, including application for or receipt of public assistance, unemployment compensation, or worker's compensation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) That the order was based on incorrect facts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A review initiated by the office under subsection (1)(f) does not preclude the recipient of support or payer from requesting a review under subsection (1)(b).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Within 180 days after determining that a review is required under subsection (1), the office must obtain a modification of the order if appropriate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The office must use the child support formula developed by the bureau under section 19 in calculating the child support award under section 17b.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The office must petition the court if modification is determined to be necessary under section 17b unless either of the following applies:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The difference between the existing and projected child support award is less than the minimum threshold for modification of a child support amount as established by the formula.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The court previously determined that application of the formula was unjust or inappropriate and the office determines that the facts of the case and the reasons for and amount of the previous deviation remain unchanged.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The notice under section 17b(3) constitutes a petition for modification of the support order and must be filed with the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the office determines there should be no change in the order and a party objects to the determination in writing to the office within 21 days after the date of the notice provided for in section 17b(3), the office must schedule a hearing before the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a support order lacks provisions for health care coverage, the office must petition the court for a modification to require that 1 or both parents obtain or maintain health care coverage for the benefit of each child who is subject to the support order when health care coverage is accessible to the child and available at a reasonable cost. The office must use the guidelines provided for in the child support formula developed by the bureau under section 19 to recommend which parent provides health care coverage that is accessible to the child and available at a reasonable cost. The office must not petition the court to require both parents to provide health care coverage under this subsection unless both parents already provide coverage or both agree to provide coverage. This subsection does not prevent the court from exercising its discretion to order health care coverage based on the child's needs or the parent's resources.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The office must determine the costs to each parent for dependent health care coverage and child care costs and must disclose those costs in the recommendation under section 17b(3).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Child support orders entered after June 30, 2005 shall be modified according to this section. For each support order entered before June 30, 2005, the friend of the court office shall provide notice to the parties of their right to a review under this section as required by federal law. Notices under this subsection may be placed in court orders as allowed by federal law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The friend of the court office shall initiate proceedings to review support by sending a notice to the parties. The notice shall request information sufficient to allow the friend of the court to review support, state the date the information is due, and advise the parties concerning how the review will be conducted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) After the information in subsection (2) is due, but not sooner than 21 days or later than 120 days after the date the notice is sent, the friend of the court office shall calculate the support amount in accordance with the child support formula and send a notice to each party and his or her attorney, which shall include all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The amount calculated for support.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The proposed effective date of the support amount.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Substantially the following statement: "Either party may object to the recommended support amount. If no objection is filed within 21 days of the date this notice was mailed, an order will be submitted to the court incorporating the new support amount." The notice also shall inform the parties of how and where to file an objection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Twenty-one or more days from the date the notice required by subsection (3) is sent, the friend of the court office shall determine if an objection has been filed. If an objection has been filed, the friend of the court shall set the matter for a hearing before a judge or referee or, if the office receives additional information with the objection, it may recalculate the support amount and send out a revised notice in accordance with subsection (3). If no objection is filed, the friend of the court office shall prepare an order. The court shall enter the order if it approves of the order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The friend of the court may schedule a joint meeting between the parties to attempt to expedite resolution of support issues in accordance with the guidelines developed under section 19(3)(m). The joint meeting and proceedings following the joint meeting are subject to the requirements of section 42a of the support and parenting time enforcement act, MCL 552.642a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The following provisions apply to support review proceedings under this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A recommendation under subsection (3) shall state the calculations upon which the support amount is based. If the friend of the court office recommends a support amount based on imputed income, the recommendation shall also state the amount that would have been recommended based on the actual income of the parties if the actual income of the parties is known. If income is imputed, the recommendation shall recite all factual assumptions upon which the imputed income is based.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The friend of the court office may impute income to a party who fails or refuses to provide information requested under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) At a hearing based on an objection to a friend of the court office recommendation, the trier of fact may consider the friend of the court office's recommendation as evidence to prove a fact relevant to the support calculation if no other evidence is presented concerning that fact, if the parties agree or no objection is made to its use for that purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The court shall not require proof of a substantial change in circumstances to modify a child support order when support is adjusted under section 17(1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A party may also file a motion to modify support. Upon motion of a party, the court may only modify a child support order upon finding a substantial change in circumstances, including, but not limited to, health care coverage becoming newly available to a party and a change in the support level under section 17(5)(a).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the friend of the court office shall conduct a more frequent review of the support order upon presentation by a party of evidence of a substantial change in circumstances as set forth in the child support formula guidelines.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to subsection (6), for a friend of the court case, if the court determines that the payer has failed to pay support under a support order and the failure was willful, the court may order that on January 1 and July 1 of each year, a surcharge be added to support payments that are past due as of those dates. The surcharge shall be calculated at 6-month intervals at an annual rate of interest equal to 1% plus the average interest rate paid at auctions of 5-year United States treasury notes during the 6 months immediately preceding July 1 and January 1, as certified by the state treasurer. The amount of the surcharge shall not compound. The amount shown as due and owing on the records of the friend of the court as of January 1 and July 1 of each year shall be reduced by an amount equal to 1 month's support for purposes of assessing the surcharge. Except as provided in subsection (5), a surcharge ordered by the court applies until abated by the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A surcharge ordered under subsection (1) shall be assessed on a semiannual cycle on January 1 and July 1 of each year except as otherwise provided under subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A surcharge shall not be assessed for the current semiannual cycle in any of the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Beginning on July 1, 2005, in a case in which the friend of the court is collecting on a current child support obligation and the payer has paid 90% or more of the most recent semiannual obligation during the semiannual cycle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) In a case in which a support order is entered after July 14, 2004, for any period of time a support order did not exist if support is later ordered for that period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the surcharge is waived or abated under a court order under section 3d.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A surcharge added under this section shall be collected and enforced by any means authorized under this act, the friend of the court act, or another appropriate federal or state law for the enforcement and collection of child support and paid through the state disbursement unit.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A court that orders child support may order support for a child after the child reaches 18 years of age as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The court may order child support for the time a child is regularly attending high school on a full-time basis with a reasonable expectation of completing sufficient credits to graduate from high school while residing on a full-time basis with the recipient of support or at an institution, but in no case after the child reaches 19 years and 6 months of age. A complaint or motion requesting support as provided in this section may be filed at any time before the child reaches 19 years and 6 months of age.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A support order entered under this section shall include a provision that the support terminates on the last day of a specified month, regardless of the actual graduation date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A provision contained in a judgment or an order entered before October 10, 1990 that provides for the support of a child after the child reaches 18 years of age, without an agreement of the parties as described in subsection (5), is valid and enforceable to the extent the provision provides support for the child for the time the child is regularly attending high school on a full-time basis with a reasonable expectation of completing sufficient credits to graduate from high school while residing on a full-time basis with the recipient of support or at an institution, but in no case after the child reaches 19 years and 6 months of age.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) All support orders shall be stated in monthly amounts payable on the first of each month in advance. A support obligation not paid by the last day of the month in which it accrues is past due. If a support order does not state the amount of support as a monthly amount, the support amount stated in the order shall be converted to a monthly amount using the formula established by the state court administrative office.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If payments under a support order are being made in the amount required, through income withholding, pursuant to an installment payment order, or otherwise, and there are no preexisting arrearages, the friend of the court shall not consider the payer as having an arrearage if a periodic temporary arrearage is created by the conversion of the monthly support order to an income withholding order or other payment schedule or results from a divergence between the cycle of payments under the income withholding or payment schedule and the cycle of charges.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a support order takes effect on other than the first day of a month, the monthly amount is prorated based on the daily amount for that month. A monthly support order amount shall not be prorated for the last month in which the order is in effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the title IV-D agency receives a support payment that, at the time of its receipt, exceeds a payer's support amount payable plus an amount payable under an arrearage payment schedule, the title IV-D agency shall apply the excess against the payer's total arrearage accrued under all support orders under which the payer is obligated. If a balance remains after application against the total arrearage, the title IV-D agency shall do 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the payer designates the balance as additional support, immediately disburse that amount to the recipient of support.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If, at the time the payment is received, the payer is obligated under a support order for a future support payment and the balance is less than or equal to the monthly support order amount, retain the balance and disburse it to the recipient of support immediately when the amount is payable as support.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If, at the time the payment is received, the payer is not obligated for a future support payment, or the payer is obligated under a support order for a future support payment but the balance is greater than the monthly support order amount, return the balance to the payer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) After 1 year after the date the amendatory act that added this subsection is enacted into law, if a payer has paid money that has not been disbursed to the payee and the payer is entitled to a refund of all or a portion of the money because support has been abated in whole or in part, the refund shall be applied first to any support past due in the case and then to any past due support the payer owes in another case. Any balance after the application of the money to support arrearages shall be refunded to the payer.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) On and after June 1, 2003, each support order the court enters or modifies must include substantially the following provisions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If a child for whom support is payable under the order is under the state's jurisdiction and is placed in foster care, that support payable under the order is assigned to the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If a child for whom support is payable under the order is under court jurisdiction and is placed in county-funded foster care, that support payable under the order is assigned to the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For a friend of the court case, substantially the following statements:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) "The office of the friend of the court may consider the person who is providing the actual care, support, and maintenance of a child for whom support is ordered as the recipient of support for the child and may redirect support paid for that child to that recipient of support, subject to the procedures prescribed in section 5d of the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.605d.".</div>

After an objection, the office of the friend of the court must review the support order under section 17 of the friend of the court act, MCL 552.517, or must notify each party that the party may file a motion to modify support.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The state friend of the court bureau may implement policies to assist offices of the friend of the court in determining when an office of the friend of the court should give notice of a proposed redirection or abatement of support under this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A payer who has an arrearage under a support order may file a motion with the circuit court for a payment plan to pay arrearages and to discharge or abate arrearages. Except as provided in subsection (7)(d), if the payer files a motion for a payment plan, the court shall approve the plan after notice and a hearing if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the plan is in the best interest of the parties and children and that either of the following applies:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The arrearage is owed to an individual payee and both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The payee has consented to entry of the order under circumstances that satisfy the court that the payee is not acting under fear, coercion, or duress.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The payer establishes that the arrearage did not arise from conduct by the payer engaged in exclusively for the purpose of avoiding a support obligation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The arrearage is owed to this state or a political subdivision of this state, and the payer establishes the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The arrearage did not arise from conduct by the payer engaged in exclusively for the purpose of avoiding a support obligation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The payer has no present ability, and will not have an ability in the foreseeable future, to pay the arrearage absent a payment plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The payment plan will pay a reasonable portion of the arrearage over a reasonable period of time in accordance with the payer's current ability to pay. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The office of child support or its designee has been served with a copy of the motion at least 56 days before the hearing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) When the payer has completed a plan approved under subsection (1), the payer shall provide notice to interested parties and obtain a hearing before the court. If, after notice and hearing, the court finds that the payer has completed the payment plan, the court shall enter an order discharging the remaining arrearage, if any. If the court finds that the payer has substantially completed the payment plan, the court may enter an order granting relief appropriate to the circumstances of the case.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A payment plan may provide for discharge of any portion of an arrearage that meets the requirements under subsection (2), even if other portions of the arrearage do not meet those requirements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A payment plan under subsection (1) shall provide that arrearages subject to the payment plan may be reinstated upon motion and hearing for good cause shown at any time during the pendency of the payment plan. Good cause includes, but is not limited to, the payee becoming a recipient of public assistance, or the payer receiving property sufficient to pay a substantial portion of the amount discharged, including, but not limited to, lottery proceeds, other winnings, a settlement under an insurance policy or a judgment in a civil action, or an inheritance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A court shall require conditions in a payment plan approved under subsection (1) in addition to the payment of support that the court determines are in the best interests of a child, including, but not limited to, any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A payer's participation in a parenting program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Drug and alcohol counseling.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Anger management classes or participation in a batterer intervention program that meets the standards recommended by the governor's task force on batterer intervention standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Participation in a work program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Counseling.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Continuing compliance with a current support order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) This section does not modify the right of a party to receive other child support credits to which the payer is entitled nor prevent the court from correcting a support order under other applicable law or court rule.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) In making its findings under subsection (1), the court shall consider any written comments submitted before the hearing by the office of child support or its designee. When written comments have not been submitted, the court may do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Adjourn the hearing to seek written comments before making its decision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Appoint an examiner who shall review the payer's assets and the plan and make a recommendation concerning the plan or propose an alternative plan to the court. The examiner shall be paid by the payer for services provided under terms and conditions the court establishes separately from any payments made through the friend of the court or state disbursement unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Appoint a receiver who shall review the payer's assets and the plan and make a recommendation concerning the plan or propose an alternative plan to the court. A receiver appointed under this subdivision has the powers of a receiver under all applicable laws and may, at the court's discretion, use the payer's assets to complete the plan or otherwise monitor the payer's progress in completing the plan. The receiver shall be paid by the payer for services provided under terms and conditions the court establishes separately from any payments made through the friend of the court or state disbursement unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Approve the plan as presented, but only if the payer satisfies the requirements of subsection (1) by clear and convincing evidence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Deny the plan as presented if the court finds that the payer has not satisfied the requirements of subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the court approves a plan under subsection (1)(b), that approval shall be considered the state's consent to a compromise of the arrearage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An arrearage subject to a plan under subsection (1) shall continue to be enforced under this act, the office of child support act, 1971 PA 174, MCL 400.231 to 400.240, and the friend of the court act, if federal or state law requires the enforcement action. If federal or state law does not require the enforcement action, an arrearage subject to a plan under subsection (1) may continue to be enforced as allowed under this act, the office of child support act, 1971 PA 174, MCL 400.231 to 400.240, and the friend of the court act, except that when the payer is complying with the plan, a referee, judge, or person conducting an administrative review or hearing as allowed under the acts shall not allow enforcement to continue when the statute permits the exercise of discretion in using the enforcement and the payer is complying with the plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A person who knowingly provides false information on a motion filed under subsection (1) is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 180 days or a fine of not more than $1,000.00, or both.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) For a friend of the court case, if income withholding is not immediately effective and the arrearage under a support order reaches the arrearage amount that requires the initiation of 1 or more support enforcement measures as provided in section 11 of the friend of the court act, MCL 552.511, or, if the amount of income withholding is administratively adjusted for arrears under section 17e of the friend of the court act, MCL 552.517e, the office of the friend of the court immediately shall send notice of the arrearage to the payer by ordinary mail to his or her last known address. The notice to the payer shall contain the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The amount of the arrearage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) One or both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) That the payer's income is subject to income withholding and the amount to be withheld.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) That the payer's income withholding is being administratively adjusted and the amount of the adjustment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) That income withholding will be applied to current and subsequent employers and periods of employment and other sources of income.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) That the order of income withholding is effective and notice to withhold income will be sent to the payer's source of income.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) That the payer may request a hearing under subsection (3) in writing within 21 days after the date of the notice to contest the withholding, but only on the grounds that the withholding is not proper because of a mistake of fact concerning the amount of current or overdue support or the identity of the payer, and if the notice includes an administrative adjustment of arrears, that the administrative adjustment will cause an unjust or inappropriate result.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) That if the hearing is held before a referee, the payer has a right to a de novo hearing before a circuit court judge.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The place where a request for hearing under subsection (3) shall be filed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) That if the payer believes that the amount of support should be modified due to a change in circumstances, the payer may file a petition with the court for modification of the support order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A payer to whom notice is sent under subsection (1), within 21 days after the date on which the notice was sent, may request a hearing by filing a request for hearing as provided in the notice and serving a copy on the other party. A hearing concerning implementation of income withholding that was not previously effective may be requested only on the grounds that the withholding is not proper because of a mistake of fact concerning the amount of current or overdue support or the identity of the payer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a payer requests a hearing under subsection (2), the notice and request shall be filed with the court clerk as a motion contesting the proposed action and a referee or circuit judge shall hold a hearing within 14 days after the date of the request. If at the hearing the payer establishes that the withholding is not proper because of a mistake of fact concerning the amount of current or overdue support or the identity of the payer, or that periodic implementation of an administrative adjustment of the amount of the periodic payment of arrears to be withheld will cause an unjust or inappropriate result, the income withholding shall be modified or rescinded according to the guidelines established under section 19 of the friend of the court act, MCL 552.519.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the hearing provided under subsection (3) is held before a referee, either party may request a de novo hearing as provided in section 7 of the friend of the court act, MCL 552.507.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a petition for modification of the support order is filed by or on behalf of a payer and is pending at the date scheduled for a hearing under subsection (3), the court may consolidate the hearing under subsection (3) and a hearing on the petition for modification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) All proceedings under this section shall be completed within 45 days after the date that notice was sent under subsection (1), unless otherwise permitted by the court upon a showing of good cause.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The friend of the court office may review the objection administratively before a hearing is held before a referee or judge. If the friend of the court office reviews the objection administratively, either party may object and a hearing shall be held before a referee or judge.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If there is more than 1 order to withhold income for support, fees, or health care coverage premiums against a payer or parent under this act, the source of income shall comply with all of the notices to withhold income to the extent that the total amount withheld from the payer's or parent's income does not exceed 50% of the payer's disposable income as that term is defined in 15 USC 1672.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If all orders to withhold income are from this state and the total amount designated in the notices to withhold income for current and past due support exceeds 50% of the payer's disposable earnings, the source of income shall withhold an amount equal to 50% of the payer's disposable earnings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If 1 or more of the orders to withhold income are from another state, the source of income shall give priority to amounts designated in each notice as current support, as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the total of the amounts designated in the notices as current support exceeds 50% of the payer's disposable earnings, then the source of income shall allocate to each order an amount for current support equal to the amount designated in the notice as current support, divided by the total of the amounts designated in the notices as current support, multiplied by the amount of income available for income withholding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the total of the amounts designated in the notices as current support does not exceed 50% of the payer's disposable earnings, then the source of income shall pay the amounts designated as current support, and in addition shall proportionately allocate to each order an amount for past due support not to exceed the amount designated in the notice as past due support. This subdivision does not require the maximum withholding to satisfy past due child or spousal support.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the total amounts allocated to current and past due support do not exceed 50% of the payer's disposable earnings, then the source of income shall allocate the remaining income to the parent's portion of health care coverage premiums attributable to coverage of the children specified in the order if remaining income is sufficient to cover the cost of the premium. This subdivision does not require a source of income to pay the parent's portion of health care coverage premiums.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A source of income shall identify each withholding by payer, payer's social security number, case numbers, amount withheld, and the date on which support was withheld from the payer's income. If the source of income is an employer, it shall also provide its federal employer identification number. A source of income may meet the requirements of this subsection through the use of an automated reporting system established by the SDU.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A source of income may combine amounts withheld from payers' incomes in a single payment and separately identify by payer, social security number, and case number the portion of the single payment that is attributable to each individual payer.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a payer is called to emergency military service, that payer may request a military service adjustment on his or her support obligation by providing a written request to the office of the friend of the court along with information showing all military and civilian pay. A military service adjustment shall be made by multiplying the payer's child support by a fraction, the numerator of which is the payer's income during emergency military service and the denominator of which is the payer's income upon which the support was ordered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a payer is not eligible for a military service adjustment before the date the friend of the court receives the request for the military service adjustment. If the payer requests a military service adjustment on or before 56 days from the date the payer is called to emergency military service, the friend of the court shall make the military service adjustment effective beginning on the date of the commencement of emergency military service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the friend of the court receives a request for a military service adjustment under subsection (1), the friend of the court shall calculate the adjustment as provided under this section and shall notify all parties of the amount of the adjustment, that they may object to the adjustment within 21 days, and of the place and manner for filing objections.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a party objects to a military service adjustment under this section, the military service adjustment shall continue until a party's objection is resolved under subsection (5) or until 35 days after the payer's emergency military service ends, whichever is sooner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a party objects to a military service adjustment under this section, the friend of the court shall set a hearing to be held before a judge or referee to determine whether the military service adjustment should be modified or set aside. The hearing shall be held as soon as possible, and the court may permit the payer to appear at the hearing by any means authorized by supreme court rules. If the court cannot hold the hearing during the payer's emergency military service, the court shall do 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Hold the hearing no later than 35 days after the payer's emergency military service ends.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Conduct a support review upon a payer's return from emergency military service. If a support review is conducted, the notice of adjustment shall be treated as a petition for modification of support for determining an effective date for the modification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Schedule a meeting between the parties to be held upon the payer's return from emergency military service to attempt to resolve the dispute over whether the adjustment should be set aside or modified.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) As used in this section, "emergency military service" means that the payer is a member of the armed forces reserves or national guard, called into active military duty for a period of more than 30 days.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the court awards to the payer sole custody of a child for whom the payer has been previously ordered to pay support and a previously accumulated arrearage under the support order for that child does not exist, the court shall modify any existing support order to exclude support ordered to be paid by that payer for that particular child. If an existing support order does not provide for support to any other child of whom the payer does not have custody, for support to a former spouse, or for payments of pregnancy or birth expenses, the court shall terminate the order of income withholding as soon as any previously accumulated arrearage has been paid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The office of the friend of the court shall suspend or terminate an order of income withholding under any of the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The location of the child and custodial parent cannot be determined for a period of 60 days or more, and the friend of the court case is being closed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The court determines that there is no further support obligation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) When otherwise determined by the court, upon a showing of good cause, and if the court determines that such suspension or termination is not contrary to the best interests of the child. In making a determination under this subdivision, the court may consider the previous payment record of the payer, evidence of the payer's intent to make regular and timely support payments, and any other factors considered relevant by the court. However, the payment of arrearages under the support order shall not be the sole reason for termination of an order of income withholding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The parties enter into a written agreement that is reviewed and entered in the record by the court that provides for all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The order of income withholding shall be suspended.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) An alternative payment arrangement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) For a friend of the court case, the payer shall keep the office of the friend of the court informed of both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) The name and address of his or her current source of income.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) Any health care coverage that is available to him or her as a benefit of employment or that is maintained by him or her; the name of the insurance company, health care organization, or health maintenance organization; the policy, certificate, or contract number; and names and birth dates of the persons for whose benefit he or she maintains health care coverage under the policy, certificate, or contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The parties shall not enter into a written agreement under subsection (2)(d) if either of the following circumstances exists:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) There is a support arrearage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An order of income withholding was previously suspended or terminated and subsequently implemented due to the payer's failure to pay support.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a written agreement is entered into under subsection (2)(d), the order of income withholding shall take effect when an arrearage in support payments as agreed to under the written agreement reaches the arrearage amount that would require the initiation of 1 or more support enforcement measures if the case were a friend of the court case, as provided in section 11 of the friend of the court act, MCL 552.511.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The court may suspend or terminate an order of income withholding if the custodial parent moves out of this state without court authorization.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The office of the friend of the court shall promptly refund money that has been improperly withheld.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A source of income shall not use a notice of income withholding as a basis for refusing to employ, discharging, taking disciplinary action against, or imposing a penalty against a payer. A source of income who refuses to employ, discharges, disciplines, or penalizes a payer in violation of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $500.00, and shall be required to make full restitution to the aggrieved payer, including reinstatement and back pay.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A source of income shall not use the suspension, as provided for in this act, of an occupational license, driver's license, or recreational or sporting license as the basis for refusing to employ, discharging, taking disciplinary action against, or imposing a penalty against a payer unless the suspended license is legally required for the payer's performance of the job.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A lien shall not be perfected or levied under this act unless the title IV-D agency has provided a notice to the payer that liens exist by operation of law and that the payer's real and personal property can be encumbered or seized if an arrearage accrues in an amount that exceeds the periodic support payments payable under the payer's support order for the time specified in this act. Notice has been provided if it is in the payer's support order or if it was mailed to the payer at any time.</div>

For the purposes of compensation under a worker's compensation order, settlement, redemption order, or voluntary payment, as used in this subparagraph, "medical services" means services as described and regulated under sections 315 and 319 of the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.315 and 418.319, and the rules promulgated under those sections.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) An amount to reimburse an insurance company for the expense incurred by the insurance company in responding to a lien and levy under sections 25b to 25i. A reimbursement amount under this subparagraph shall not exceed the actual expense or $50.00, whichever is less, for each lien and levy or for each payment under a lien and levy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) Other costs related to the arbitration, civil action, or worker's compensation order, settlement, redemption order, or voluntary payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vii) For reimbursements to which an employer or carrier is entitled under section 827 of the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, 1969 PA 317, MCL 418.827.</div>

The title IV-D agency shall perfect a lien on property to which this section applies in the same manner in which another lien on property of the same type is perfected.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Within 21 days after the date on which the notice described in subsection (4) is mailed to a payer, the payer may request a review on the lien and the proposed action. If the payer requests a review under this subsection, the title IV-D agency shall conduct the review within 14 days after the date of the request.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If, at the review, the payer establishes that the lien is not proper because of a mistake of fact, the title IV-D agency shall terminate or modify the lien and, within 7 days, notify the applicable entity that the lien is terminated against all or a portion of the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the payer fails to request a review, to appear for a review, or to establish a mistake of fact, the title IV-D agency may collect the arrearage by levy upon any property belonging to the payer as provided in this section.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A payer may request that the title IV-D agency terminate a lien against the real and personal property of the payer on the basis that the payer is no longer in arrears. If the payer is no longer in arrears, the title IV-D agency shall terminate the lien in accordance with law.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the mistake is the payer's identity or that the payer does not owe past due support in an amount equal to or greater than 2 times the payer's monthly support amount under a support order, notify the financial institution, insurer, or carrier and the payer that the levy is released.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the payer does owe past due support in an amount equal to or greater than 2 times the payer's monthly support amount under a support order, but the amount in the notice to levy is more than the payer owes, notify the payer of the corrected amount.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the mistake concerns a fact other than those described in subdivisions (a) and (b), take action appropriate to the mistake.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   An employer shall not disenroll or eliminate health care coverage of a child eligible for coverage and enrolled under subsection (1) unless the employer is provided with satisfactory written evidence that 1 of the following applies:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The court or administrative order requiring health care coverage is no longer in effect.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The child is or will be enrolled in comparable health care coverage that takes effect not later than the effective date of the disenrollment from the existing plan.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a bench warrant was issued and the payer is arrested in the county that issued the warrant or another county in this state, the payer shall remain in custody until there is a hearing or the payer posts an adequate cash performance bond. If the payer cannot post the cash performance bond in the amount stated in the bench warrant, the payer is entitled to a hearing within 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays. The issues to be considered at a hearing required under this subsection are limited to the payer's answer to the contempt proceeding and, if the payer was found in contempt, to further proceedings related to the payer's contempt. If the hearing is not held as provided in this subsection, the court shall review, based on criteria prescribed in the Michigan court rules, the amount of the cash performance bond to determine an amount that will ensure the payer's appearance and shall set a date for a hearing to be held under subsection (4) within the time limit prescribed in the Michigan court rules.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The officer receiving a cash performance bond under subsection (1) shall give to the arrested payer a receipt for the cash performance bond on a form substantially as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>"Date _________________________</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Received from ____________________ (referred to in this receipt as "the payer") to assure the performance of the payer's support obligation. The payer shall appear for hearing at a date noticed to the payer by the court at the following address: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>__________________________________________________</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(address furnished by the payer for receipt of notice)</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The hearing is for the payer to answer to the contempt proceeding and, if the payer was found in contempt, to further proceedings related to the payer's contempt.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>If the payer fails to appear at the time and place indicated in the court's notice, fails to submit to the jurisdiction of the court, and fails to abide by an order of the court, the cash performance bond shall be transmitted to the friend of the court or to the state disbursement unit for payment of the arrearage to the recipient of support and of costs to the court. If the payer appears at the time and place indicated above and the court determines that the payer owes an arrearage under the support order that is the basis of the contempt proceeding or owes costs to the court, the cash performance bond deposited shall be transmitted to the office of the friend of the court or to the state disbursement unit for payment of the arrearage to the recipient of support and of costs to the court. By depositing the cash performance bond with the officer and accepting this receipt, the recipient of this receipt waives a claim to the money under the cash performance bond following its transmittal to the friend of the court or to the SDU.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>________________________________</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Officer:______________Dept.: _____".</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The officer receiving a cash performance bond shall in turn deposit the bond received under this section with the clerk of the court that issued the bench warrant. If the payer deposits a cash performance bond under this section, the date for a hearing to be held under subsection (4) shall be set within the time limit prescribed in the Michigan court rules.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) At a hearing held after a payer deposits a cash performance bond, the issues to be considered are limited to the payer's answer to the contempt proceeding and, if the payer was found in contempt, to further proceedings related to the payer's contempt. On the basis of the hearing, the court by order shall determine how much of the cash performance bond deposited under this section is to be transmitted to the friend of the court or to the SDU for payment to 1 or more recipients of support and to the county treasurer for distribution as provided in section 31. The balance, if any, shall be returned to the person who posted the cash performance bond on the payer's behalf.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the payer fails to appear as required, the court shall order the cash performance bond forfeited and transmit the bond to the friend of the court or to the SDU for payment to 1 or more recipients of support and to the county treasurer for distribution as provided in section 31. In addition, the court may again issue a bench warrant for the further appearance of the payer as provided in section 31.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The court may set aside a finding of contempt under section 31 if the court finds, based on the hearing under this section, that the payer is in compliance with the court's order or for other good cause shown.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a payer for whom a bench warrant has been issued may voluntarily appear at the office of the friend of the court to answer the bench warrant. The payer shall do either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Post the bond set by the court in the bench warrant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Be taken promptly before the court for further proceedings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a bond is posted under subsection (7)(a), the friend of the court or the clerk of the court shall give a receipt to the payer that substantially conforms to the requirements of subsection (2). The receipt shall direct the payer to appear before the court at a specific time and date. The friend of the court or the clerk of the court shall notify a local law enforcement agency to remove the bench warrant from the law enforcement information network as provided by the C.J.I.S. policy council act, 1974 PA 163, MCL 28.211 to 28.215.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   At any hearing contesting proposed income withholding based on a support order entered under section 6, the support order, accompanying sworn or certified statement, and a certified copy of an order of income withholding still in effect, if any, shall constitute prima facie proof, without further proof or foundation, that the support order is valid, that the amount of current support payments and arrearages is as stated, and that the obligee would be entitled to income withholding under the law of the jurisdiction which issued the support order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Once a prima facie case has been established as provided in subsection (1), the obligor may raise only the following defenses:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That withholding is not proper because of a mistake of fact concerning the amount of current or overdue support or the identity of the obligor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   That the court or agency which issued the support order entered under this act lacked personal jurisdiction over the obligor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   That the support order entered under this act was obtained by fraud.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   That the statute of limitations under section 13 (3) precludes enforcement of all or part of the arrearages.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The burden shall be on the obligor to establish a defense under subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the obligor presents evidence which constitutes a full or partial defense, the court shall, on the request of the obligee, continue the hearing to permit further evidence relative to the defense to be adduced by either party. However, if the obligor acknowledges liability sufficient to entitle the obligee to income withholding, the court shall require income withholding for the payment of current support payments under the support order and of so much of any arrearage as is not in dispute, while continuing the hearing with respect to those matters still in dispute. The court shall determine promptly those matters still in dispute and, if appropriate, shall modify the withholding order to conform to that determination.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If only 1 of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this act, the order of that tribunal controls and must be so recognized.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If more than 1 of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this act, 1 of the following applies:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If 2 or more child-support orders have been issued for the same obligor and same child, upon request of a party who is an individual or that is a support enforcement agency, a tribunal of this state having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and the obligee who is an individual shall determine which order controls under subsection (2). The request may be filed with a registration for enforcement or registration for modification under article 6 or may be filed as a separate proceeding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A request to determine which is the controlling order must be accompanied by a copy of every child-support order in effect and the applicable record of payments.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Within 30 days after issuance of an order determining which is the controlling order, the party obtaining the order shall file a certified copy of it in each tribunal that issued or registered an earlier order of child support. A party or support enforcement agency obtaining the order that fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises. The failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability of the controlling order.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If an obligee prevails, a responding tribunal of this state may assess against an obligor filing fees, reasonable attorney's fees, other costs, and necessary travel and other reasonable expenses incurred by the obligee and the obligee's witnesses. The tribunal may not assess fees, costs, or expenses against the obligee or the support enforcement agency of either the initiating or the responding state or foreign country, except as provided by other law. Attorney's fees may be taxed as costs, and may be ordered paid directly to the attorney, who may enforce the order in the attorney's own name.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If section 613 does not apply, upon petition a tribunal of this state may modify a child-support order issued in another state that is registered in this state if, after notice and hearing, the tribunal finds that either of the following applies:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The following requirements are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Neither the child, nor the obligee who is an individual, nor the obligor resides in the issuing state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A petitioner who is a nonresident of this state seeks modification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) This state is the residence of the child, or a party who is an individual is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state, and all of the parties who are individuals have filed consents in a record in the issuing tribunal for a tribunal of this state to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Modification of a registered child-support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures, and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this state, and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a child-support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state, including the duration of the obligation of support. If 2 or more tribunals have issued child-support orders for the same obligor and same child, the order that controls and must be so recognized under section 207 establishes the aspects of the support order that are nonmodifiable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In a proceeding to modify a child-support order, the law of the state that is determined to have issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of the obligation of support. The obligor's fulfillment of the duty of support established by that order precludes imposition of a further obligation of support by a tribunal of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) On the issuance of an order by a tribunal of this state modifying a child-support order issued in another state, the tribunal of this state becomes the tribunal having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Notwithstanding subsections (1) through (5) and section 201(1), a tribunal of this state retains jurisdiction to modify an order issued by a tribunal of this state if both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) One party resides in another state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The other party resides outside the United States.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Before making a demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee, the governor of this state may require a prosecutor of this state to demonstrate that at least 60 days previously the obligee had initiated proceedings for support under this act or that the proceeding would be of no avail.</div>

If it appears that a proceeding would be effective but has not been initiated, the governor may delay honoring the demand for a reasonable time to permit the initiation of a proceeding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a proceeding for support has been initiated and the individual whose rendition is demanded prevails, the governor may decline to honor the demand. If the petitioner prevails and the individual whose rendition is demanded is subject to a support order, the governor may decline to honor the demand if the individual is complying with the support order.</div>
