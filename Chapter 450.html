<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Corporations may engage in any lawful business within this state upon any cooperative plan adopted by the incorporators, or by the shareholders at any annual or special meeting. For the purpose of this act, the term "cooperative plan" shall be deemed to mean a mode of operation whereby the earnings of the corporation are distributed on the basis of, or in proportion to, the value of property bought from or sold to shareholders and/or members or other persons, or labor performed for, or services rendered to, or by the corporation: Provided, That the foregoing definition shall not be construed as prohibiting any such corporation from paying limited dividends to stockholders and/or members upon stock and/or membership investment, or from reserving a certain proportion of earnings for future operations or for future distribution. Earnings so reserved shall be allocated on the books of the corporation or a means provided for such allocation to the stockholders and/or members or other persons entitled to such earnings, before general distribution of earnings shall have been authorized and made. Corporations organized under a cooperative plan and governed by sections 98 to 109, inclusive, of this act are hereinafter in this act called cooperative corporations and they may use the term "cooperative", "co-op", or any variation thereof in their name.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 148.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Trustee corporations; definition. Corporations may be formed to carry out the terms of any written declaration, deed or testament making donations, grants, gifts or devises in trust for specific lawful purposes. Such corporations shall be known in law as "trustee corporations," which term may also embrace other corporations as hereinafter provided for in this act. A trustee corporation is hereby defined to be any corporation wherein the trustees appointed by any instrument in writing, whether testamentary or otherwise, to have the title, care, custody or disposition of property or the income therefrom, in trust for such uses and purposes as may be named in such instrument, for the benefit of religious, charitable, benevolent, educational institutions or public benefaction of whatsoever name or nature and any other persons who may be lawfully associated with them, incorporate for the express and main purpose of carrying out the provisions of such trust. The term "trustee corporation" may also embrace any case in which trustees hold in their corporate name, any separate property of the corporation of which they are trustees for specific purposes defined or limited by any written instrument donating, setting aside or devoting such separate property for charitable, religious, benevolent, educational or other beneficial purpose, or where such property is so held by the said trustees under the terms of written instructions as to the use thereof from the governing body of any ecclesiastical, fraternal or charitable society, association or corporation. Such trustees shall in no case have any personal interest in or title to any part or portion of such trust property, nor derive any personal benefit from the principal or income thereof, excepting in the way of just compensation for their labor and skill in executing such trust or by way of reimbursement for necessary and actual expenses incurred in the management of such property or in the performance of their duties as such trustees, or except upon authority expressed in the original deed or instrument of trust. Nothing in this act contained shall be construed as preventing or prohibiting any trustees appointed or provided for under the terms of any deed, will or other written instrument to have the title or management of any property, whether real or personal, for the benefit of the donor or grantor therein or the heirs, dependents or other beneficiaries of such donor or grantor, and not for charitable, religious, educational or benevolent purposes, from incorporating under this act for the purpose of executing such trust, if such incorporation be permitted, directed or contemplated in such instrument, and the business of such corporation, when organized, is one which a corporation might otherwise carry on under this act: Provided, That declarations of trust shall not be sufficient in themselves to authorize the trustees named therein to assume corporate powers, but all such trustees referred to in this act shall be incorporated only in the manner prescribed in and by complying with the provisions of this act. Trustee corporations shall be governed by the provisions of this act relating to corporations generally except as specifically otherwise provided.</DIV>

The term "trust instrument" or "instrument of trust" as used in this act shall be construed to mean and refer to any lawful deed of gift, grant, agreement, or any last will and testament by which the donor, grantor, or testator shall give, grant, devise, or bequeath any property, real, personal or mixed, in trust for general or specific uses; and any and all conditions, terms or directions contained therein, and any act, declaration or instructions of a legal nature made by any corporation or body directing or authorizing trustees thereunder to take, receive, hold, manage or dispose of any of the property of such corporation for general or specific purposes for the benefit of such persons or objects as may be therein designated.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The charter of a nonprofit cemetery association which has become void or shall become void before December 31, 1974, under statutes of this state, requiring the filing of reports or the payment of fees, may be reinstated upon the payment before December 31, 1974, upon the filing of a current year's report, and the payment of a penalty of $10.00 to the department of treasury.

Attached to the report shall be a certificate, duly acknowledged before a notary public by an officer of the cemetery association which desires to revive its charter, stating that the association has continued in existence since the date on which the charter was forfeited and setting forth the names of those who will serve as directors or trustees of the association upon the revival of its charter.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If a nonprofit cemetery association has not heretofore filed in the office of the department of treasury its articles of association, a true copy of the articles, authenticated by the county clerk or other proper officer issuing the charter, shall be filed in the office of the department of treasury at the time of filing the current year's report, as a condition precedent to acceptance of the report by the department.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If parties have agreed to conduct a transaction by electronic means and a law requires a person to provide, send, or deliver information in writing to another person, the requirement is satisfied if the information is provided, sent, or delivered in an electronic record capable of retention by the recipient at the time of receipt.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   In an automated transaction involving an individual, the individual may void the effect of an electronic record that resulted from an error made by the individual in dealing with the electronic agent of another person if the electronic agent did not provide for the prevention or correction of the error and, at the time the individual learns of the error, all of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The individual promptly notified the other person of the error and that the individual did not intend to be bound by the electronic record received by the other person.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 15.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Unless otherwise agreed between the sender and the recipient, an electronic record is sent when it complies with all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   It is addressed properly or otherwise directed properly to an information processing system that the recipient uses for the purpose of receiving electronic records or information of the type sent and from which the recipient is able to retrieve the electronic record.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   It is in a form capable of being processed by that system.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The record enters an information processing system outside the control of the sender or of a person that sent the electronic record on behalf of the sender or enters a region of the information processing system used by the recipient that is under the control of the recipient.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Unless otherwise agreed between a sender and the recipient, an electronic record is received when it complies with all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   It enters an information processing system that the recipient uses for the purpose of receiving electronic records or information of the type sent and from which the recipient is able to retrieve the electronic record.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   It is in a form capable of being processed by that system.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Subsection (2) applies even if the place the information processing system is located is different from the place the electronic record is considered to be received under subsection (4).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Unless otherwise expressly provided in the electronic record or agreed between the sender and the recipient, an electronic record is considered to be sent from the sender's place of business and to be received at the recipient's place of business. For purposes of this subsection, all of the following rules apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the sender or recipient has more than 1 place of business, the place of business of that person is the place having the closest relationship to the underlying transaction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the sender or the recipient does not have a place of business, the place of business is the sender's or recipient's residence.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   An electronic record is received under subsection (2) even if no individual is aware of its receipt.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an information processing system described in subsection (2) establishes that a record was received but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If a person is aware that an electronic record purportedly sent under subsection (1), or purportedly received under subsection (2), was not actually sent or received, the legal effect of the sending or receipt is determined by other applicable law. Except to the extent permitted by the other law, the requirements of this subsection may not be varied by agreement.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A person has control of a transferable record if a system employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in the transferable record reliably establishes that person as the person to which the transferable record was issued or transferred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A system satisfies subsection (2), and a person is considered to have control of a transferable record, if the transferable record is created, stored, and assigned in a manner that all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A single authoritative copy of the transferable record exists that is unique, identifiable, and, except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (d), (e), and (f), unalterable.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Copies or revisions that add or change an identified assignee of the authoritative copy can be made only with the consent of the person asserting control.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy of a copy is readily identifiable as a copy that is not the authoritative copy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Any revision of the authoritative copy is readily identifiable as authorized or unauthorized.</div>

A certificate of assumed name is effective, unless sooner terminated by filing a certificate of termination or by the dissolution or withdrawal of the corporation, for a period that expires on December 31 of the fifth full calendar year following the year in which it was filed. A certificate of assumed name may be extended for additional consecutive periods of 5 full calendar years each by filing similar certificates not earlier than 90 days before the expiration of the initial or a subsequent 5-year period. The administrator shall notify the corporation of the impending expiration of the certificate of assumed name not later than 90 days before the expiration of the initial or a subsequent 5-year period. If authorized by the corporation, the administrator may electronically transmit the notice to the resident agent of the corporation. A certificate of assumed name filed under this section does not create substantive rights to the use of a particular assumed name.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The same name may be assumed by 2 or more corporations, or by 1 or more corporations and 1 or more limited partnerships or other enterprises participating together in a partnership or joint venture.

The use of an assumed name transferred under this subsection may continue for the remaining effective period of the certificate of assumed name on file before the merger, and the surviving entity may terminate or extend the certificate of assumed name under subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A corporation that survives a merger may use as an assumed name the corporate name of a merging corporation, or the name of any other entity that participates in the merger under section 736, by filing a certificate of assumed name under subsection (1) or by providing for the use of the name as an assumed name in the certificate of merger. The surviving corporation also may file a certificate of assumed name under subsection (1) or provide in the certificate of merger for the use as an assumed name of an assumed name of a merging entity that is not transferred under subsection (3). A provision in a certificate of merger under this subsection shall be treated as a new certificate of assumed name.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A business organization into which a corporation has converted under section 745 may use an assumed name of the converting corporation, if the corporation has a certificate of assumed name for that assumed name on file with the administrator before the conversion, by providing for the use of the name as an assumed name in the certificate of conversion. The use of an assumed name under this subsection may continue for the remaining effective period of the certificate of assumed name on file before the conversion, and the surviving business organization may terminate or extend the certificate of assumed name in the manner described in subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A corporation into which 1 or more business organizations have converted under section 746 may use as an assumed name the name of any business organization that converted into that corporation, or use as an assumed name an assumed name of that business organization, by filing a certificate of assumed name under subsection (1) or by providing for the use of that name or assumed name as an assumed name of the corporation in the certificate of conversion. A provision in the certificate of conversion under this subsection shall be treated as a new certificate of assumed name.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In case of default in payment of an installment or call or other amount due under a subscription agreement, including an amount which may become due as a result of a default in performance of any provision of a subscription agreement, the corporation has the following rights and duties:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   It may collect the amount due in the same manner as any other debt owing to it. At any time before full satisfaction of the claim or a judgment, it may proceed as provided in subdivision (b).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   It may sell the shares in any reasonable manner. Notice of the time and place of a public sale or of the time after which a private sale may be had, together with a statement of the amount due upon each share, shall be given in writing to the subscriber personally or by registered or certified mail at least 20 days before any time stated in the notice. Any excess of net proceeds realized over the amount due plus interest shall be paid to the subscriber. If the sale is made in good faith, in a reasonable manner and upon notice, the corporation may recover the difference between the amount due plus interest and the net proceeds of the sale. A good faith purchaser for value acquires title to the sold shares free of any right of the subscriber even though the corporation fails to comply with 1 or more of the requirements of this subdivision.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   It may rescind the subscription, with the effect provided in section 308, and may recover damages for breach of contract. Unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount, the measure of damages shall be the difference between the market price at the time and place of tender of the shares and the unpaid contract price. Liquidated damages may be provided for in the subscription agreement. The subscriber may have restitution of the amount by which the sum of his or her payments exceeds the corporation's damages for breach of contract, whether fixed by agreement or judgment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The rights and duties set forth in this section shall be interpreted as cumulative so far as is consistent with entitling the corporation to a full and single recovery of the amount due or its damages. The subscription agreement may limit the rights and remedies of the corporation set forth in this section, and may add to them so far as is consistent with this subsection.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 343.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The shareholders of a corporation do not have a preemptive right to acquire the corporation's unissued shares except to the extent provided in the articles of incorporation or by agreement between the corporation and 1 or more shareholders.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A statement included in the articles or an agreement that the corporation elects to have preemptive rights, or words of similar import, means that the following principles apply except to the extent the articles or agreement expressly provide otherwise:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The shareholders of the corporation have a preemptive right, granted on uniform terms and conditions prescribed by the board to provide a fair and reasonable opportunity to exercise the right to acquire proportional amounts of the corporation's unissued shares upon the decision of the board to issue them.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A shareholder may waive his or her preemptive right. A waiver evidenced by a writing is irrevocable even though it is not supported by consideration.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   There is no preemptive right with respect to any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Shares issued as compensation to directors, officers, agents, or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries or affiliates.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Shares issued to satisfy conversion or option rights created to provide compensation to directors, officers, agents, or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries, or affiliates.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   Shares authorized in the articles that are issued within 6 months from the effective date of incorporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)   Shares issued otherwise than for money.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Holders of shares of any class without general voting rights but with preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Holders of shares of any class with general voting rights but without preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class with preferential rights to distributions or assets unless the shares with preferential rights are convertible into or carry a right to subscribe for or acquire shares without preferential rights.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Shares subject to preemptive rights that are not acquired by shareholders may be issued to any person for a period of 1 year after being offered to shareholders at a consideration set by the board that is not lower than the consideration set for the exercise of preemptive rights. An offer at a lower consideration or after the expiration of 1 year is subject to the shareholders' preemptive rights.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   For purposes of this section, "shares" includes a security convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The preemptive rights, whether created by statute or common law, of shareholders of a corporation formed before January 1, 1973, are not affected by subsections (1) and (2). A corporation may alter or abolish its shareholders' preemptive rights by an amendment of its articles.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 344.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Subject to restrictions imposed by this act or the articles of incorporation, a corporation may acquire its own shares and those shares constitute authorized but unissued shares, except as provided in subsection (4).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the articles of incorporation prohibit reissue of any shares acquired pursuant to subsection (1), the board, by resolution, shall adopt and file an amendment of the articles of incorporation reducing the number of authorized shares accordingly.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A corporation shall not acquire its own shares by purchase, redemption, or otherwise unless after the acquisition there remain outstanding shares possessing, collectively, voting rights and unlimited rights to receive assets in dissolution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A corporation that acquires its own shares may grant a security interest in the shares as security for the payment of the purchase price of the shares. Any shares acquired by the corporation in which it has granted a security interest are not canceled and do not constitute authorized but unissued shares until the corporation pays the purchase price. If the corporation has granted a security interest in the shares, the shares shall not be voted directly or indirectly and shall not be counted in determining the total number of issued shares entitled to vote at any given time, except to the extent provided by the agreement creating the security interest in the event of default. Upon payment of the purchase price, the shares shall be canceled and constitute authorized but unissued shares. If the articles of incorporation prohibit reissue of canceled shares, then the amendment required by subsection (2) shall be filed.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 345.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A board may authorize and the corporation may make distributions to its shareholders subject to restriction by the articles of incorporation and the limitation in subsection (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the board does not fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution, other than a distribution involving a purchase, redemption, or acquisition of the corporation's shares, the record date is the date the board authorizes the distribution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A distribution shall not be made if, after giving it effect, the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as the debts become due in the usual course of business, or the corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus, unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise, the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The board may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (3) on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances, on a fair valuation, or on another method that is reasonable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The effect of a distribution under subsection (3) is measured at the following times:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Except as provided in subsection (7), in the case of a distribution by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation's shares, as of the earlier of the date money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the corporation, or the date the shareholder ceases to be a shareholder with respect to the acquired shares.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   In the case of any other distribution of indebtedness, as of the date the indebtedness is authorized if distribution occurs within 120 days after the date of authorization or the date the indebtedness is distributed if it occurs more than 120 days after the date of authorization.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   In all other cases, as of the date the distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within 120 days after the date of authorization or the date the payment is made if it occurs more than 120 days after the date of authorization.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A corporation's indebtedness to a shareholder incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the corporation's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors, except as otherwise agreed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If the corporation acquires its shares in exchange for an obligation to make future payments, and distribution of the obligation would otherwise be prohibited under subsection (3) at the time it is made, the corporation may issue the obligation and the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The portion of the obligation that could have been distributed without violating subsection (3) shall be treated as indebtedness as described in subsection (6).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   All of the following apply to the portion of the obligation that exceeds the amount treated as indebtedness under subdivision (a):</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   At any time prior to the due date of the obligation, payments of principal and interest may be made as a distribution to the extent that a distribution may then be made under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   At any time on or after the due date, the obligation to pay principal and interest is deemed distributed and treated as indebtedness described in subsection (6) to the extent that a distribution may then be made under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   Unless otherwise provided in the agreement for the acquisition of the shares, the obligation is a liability or debt for purposes of determining whether distributions other than payments on the obligation may be made under this section, except for purposes of determining whether distributions may be made with respect to shares having preferential rights superior to those of the shares acquired in exchange for the obligation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The enforceability of a guaranty or other undertaking by a third party relating to a distribution shall not be affected by the prohibition of the distribution under subsection (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   If a claim is made to recover a distribution made contrary to subsection (3) or if a violation of subsection (3) is raised as a defense to a claim based upon a distribution, nothing in this section prevents the person receiving the distribution from asserting a right of rescission or other legal or equitable rights.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided in this act, written notice of the time, place if any, and purposes of a meeting of shareholders shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. Notice may be given personally, by mail, or by electronic transmission. If a shareholder or proxy holder may be present and vote at the meeting by remote communication, the means of remote communication allowed shall be included in the notice.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Unless the corporation has securities registered under section 12 of title I of the securities exchange act of 1934, chapter 404, 48 Stat. 892, 15 U.S.C. 78l, notice of the purposes of a meeting shall include notice of shareholder proposals that are proper subjects for shareholder action and are intended to be presented by shareholders who have notified the corporation in writing of their intention to present the proposals at the meeting.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The articles of incorporation may provide that any action required or permitted under this act to be taken at an annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote, if consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, are signed by the holders of outstanding shares that have at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take the action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on the action were present and voted. A written consent shall bear the date of signature of the shareholder that signs the consent. Written consents are not effective to take corporate action unless within 60 days after the record date for determining shareholders entitled to express consent to or to dissent from a proposal without a meeting, written consents dated not more than 10 days before the record date and signed by a sufficient number of shareholders to take the action are delivered to the corporation. Delivery shall be to the corporation's registered office, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation that has custody of the minutes of the proceedings of its shareholders. Delivery made to a corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to shareholders that would have been entitled to notice of the shareholder meeting if the action had been taken at a meeting and that have not consented to the action in writing. If the action consented to would have required filing of a certificate under any other section of this act if the action had been voted on by shareholders at a meeting of the shareholders, the certificate filed under the other section shall state, in lieu of any statement required under that section concerning a vote of shareholders, that both written consent and written notice have been given as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Any action required or permitted under this act to be taken at an annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote, if before or after the action all the shareholders entitled to vote consent in writing. If the action consented to would have required filing of a certificate under any other section of this act if the action had been voted upon by shareholders at a meeting, the certificate filed under the other section shall state, in lieu of any statement required under that section concerning a vote of shareholders, that written consent has been given as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An electronic transmission consenting to an action transmitted by a shareholder or proxy holder, or by a person authorized to act for the shareholder or proxy holder, is written, signed, and dated for the purposes of this section if the electronic transmission is delivered with information from which the corporation can determine that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the shareholder or proxy holder, or by the person authorized to act for the shareholder or proxy holder, and the date on which the electronic transmission was transmitted. The date on which an electronic transmission is transmitted is the date on which the consent was signed for purposes of this section. A consent given by electronic transmission is not delivered until reproduced in paper form and the paper form delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in this state, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation that has custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery to a corporation's registered office shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. Delivery to a corporation's principal place of business or to an officer or agent of the corporation that has custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded shall be made by hand, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or in any other manner provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws or by resolution of the board of directors of the corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A person may execute a shareholder consent under this section that directs that the shareholder consent will take effect at a future time. All of the following apply for purposes of this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The person may provide the direction through an agent or in some other manner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Subject to subdivision (c), the person shall select a specific date on which the consent takes effect that is not more than 60 days after the date the person provides the direction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The person may direct that the consent will take effect at the time a specified future event occurs rather than on a specific date under subdivision (b), if that event will occur not more than 60 days after the date the person provides the direction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The consent shall only take effect if the person is a shareholder on the record date applicable to the consent under section 412(2). A person is not required to be a shareholder at the time the consent is executed or evidence of the direction is provided to the corporation for the consent to take effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Unless otherwise provided in the direction, a direction is revocable at any time before the consent becomes effective.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) For the purposes of this section, if evidence of a direction under this subsection is provided to the corporation and is not revoked, the future time established in the direction is considered the time the consent takes effect and is considered the date of signature of the consent.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of shareholders or an adjournment of a meeting, the bylaws may provide for fixing, or in the absence of a provision the board may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board. The date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of the meeting. If a record date is not fixed, the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if no notice is given, the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

In the absence of a provision, the board may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board and shall not be more than 10 days after the board resolution. If a record date is not fixed and prior action by the board is required with respect to the corporate action to be taken without a meeting, the record date shall be the close of business on the day on which the resolution of the board is adopted. If a record date is not fixed and prior action by the board is not required, the record date shall be the first date on which a signed written consent is delivered to the corporation as provided in section 407.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to receive payment of a share dividend or distribution, or allotment of a right, or for the purpose of any other action, the bylaws may provide for fixing, or in the absence of a provision the board may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board.

<P>Sec. 421.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders or to express consent or dissent without a meeting may authorize other persons to act for him or her by proxy.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A proxy is not valid after the expiration of 3 years from its date unless otherwise provided in the proxy.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Without limiting the manner in which a shareholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her as proxy pursuant to subsection (1), the following methods constitute a valid means by which a shareholder may grant authority to another person to act as proxy:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The execution of a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for the shareholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the shareholder or by an authorized officer, director, employee, or agent signing the writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to the writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, facsimile signature.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will hold the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization, or similar agent fully authorized by the person who will hold the proxy to receive that transmission. Any telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram, or other electronic transmission was authorized by the shareholder. If a telegram, cablegram, or other electronic transmission is determined to be valid, the inspectors, or, if there are no inspectors, the persons making the determination shall specify the information upon which they relied.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A copy, facsimile telecommunication, or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to subsection (3) may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any purpose for which the original writing or transmission could be used, if the copy, facsimile telecommunication, or other reproduction is a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A proxy is revocable at the pleasure of the shareholder executing it, except as otherwise provided in this section and sections 422 and 423.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The authority of the holder of a proxy to act is not revoked by the incompetence or death of the shareholder who executed the proxy unless, before the authority is exercised, written notice of an adjudication of the incompetence or death is received by the corporate officer responsible for maintaining the list of shareholders.</DIV>

In a case provided for in section 422(c) or (d), the proxy is revocable 3 years after the date of the proxy or at the end of any period specified in the proxy, whichever period is less, unless the period of irrevocability is renewed by execution of a new irrevocable proxy.

<P>Sec. 487.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Upon written request of a shareholder, a corporation shall mail to the shareholder its balance sheet as at the end of the preceding fiscal year; its statement of income for the fiscal year; and, if prepared by the corporation, its statement of source and application of funds for the fiscal year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Any shareholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall have the right during the usual hours of business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its shareholders, and its other books and records, if the shareholder gives the corporation written demand describing with reasonable particularity his or her purpose and the records he or she desires to inspect, and the records sought are directly connected with the purpose. A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a shareholder. The demand shall be delivered to the corporation at its registered office in this state or at its principal place of business. In every instance where an attorney or other agent shall be the person who seeks to inspect, the demand shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or other writing which authorizes the attorney or other agent to act on behalf of the shareholder.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the corporation does not permit an inspection within 5 business days after a demand has been received in compliance with subsection (2), or imposes unreasonable conditions upon the inspection, the shareholder may apply to the circuit court of the county in which the principal place of business or registered office of the corporation is located for an order to compel the inspection. If the shareholder seeks to inspect the corporation's books and records other than its stock ledger or list of shareholders, he or she shall first establish that he or she has complied with this section respecting the form and manner of making demand for inspection of the documents, that the inspection he or she seeks is for a proper purpose, and that the documents sought are directly connected with the purpose. If the shareholder seeks to inspect the corporation's stock ledger or list of shareholders and has established compliance with this section respecting the form and manner of making demand for the inspection of the documents, the burden of proof shall be upon the corporation to establish that the inspection that is sought is for an improper purpose or that the records sought are not directly connected with the person's purpose. The court may, in its discretion, order the corporation to permit the shareholder to inspect the corporation's stock ledger, a list of shareholders, and its other books and records on conditions and with limitations as the court may prescribe and may award other or further relief as the court may consider just and proper. The court may order books, documents and records, pertinent extracts, or duly authenticated copies, to be brought within this state and kept in this state upon terms and conditions as the court may prescribe.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A director shall have the right to examine any of the corporation's books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his or her position as a director. The director may apply to the circuit court of the county in which the principal place of business or registered office of the corporation is located for an order to compel the inspection. The court may, in its discretion, order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and all books and records, on conditions and with limitations as the court may prescribe and may award other and further relief as the court may consider just and proper.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the court orders inspection of the records demanded under subsection (3) or (4), it shall also order the corporation to pay the shareholder's or director's costs, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred to obtain the order unless the corporation proves that it failed to permit the inspection in good faith because it had a reasonable basis to doubt the right of the shareholder or director to inspect the records demanded.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   As used in this section, "the right to inspect records" includes the right to copy and make extracts from the records and, if reasonable, the right to require the corporation to supply copies made by photographic, xerographic, or other means. The corporation may require the shareholder to pay a reasonable charge, covering the costs of labor and material, for copies of the documents provided to the shareholder.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) It eliminates the board or restricts the discretion or powers of the board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) It governs the authorization or making of distributions whether or not in proportion to ownership of shares, subject to limitations in sections 345 and 855a pertaining to the protection of creditors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) It establishes who shall be directors or officers of the corporation, or the terms of office or manner of selection or removal of directors or officers of the corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) In general or in regard to specific matters, it governs the exercise or division of voting power by or between the shareholders and directors or by or among any of the shareholders or directors, including use of weighted voting rights or director proxies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) It establishes the terms and conditions of any agreement for the transfer or use of property or the provision of services between the corporation and any shareholder, director, officer, or employee of the corporation or among the shareholders, directors, officers, or employees of the corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) It transfers to 1 or more shareholders or other persons all or part of the authority to exercise the corporate powers or to manage the business and affairs of the corporation, including the resolution of any issue about which there exists a deadlock among directors or shareholders.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) It requires dissolution of the corporation at the request of 1 or more of the shareholders or if a specified event or contingency occurs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) It establishes that shares of the corporation are assessable and includes the procedures for an assessment and the consequences of a failure by a shareholder to pay an assessment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) It otherwise governs the exercise of the corporate powers or the management of the business and affairs of the corporation or the relationship among the shareholders, the directors, and the corporation, or among any of the shareholders or directors, and is not contrary to public policy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An agreement authorized by this section shall meet both of the following requirements:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Is set forth in a provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws approved by all persons that are shareholders at the time of the agreement, or in a written agreement that is signed by all persons that are shareholders at the time of the agreement and that is made known to the corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Is subject to amendment only by all persons that are shareholders at the time of the amendment, unless the agreement provides otherwise.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The existence of an agreement authorized under this section shall be noted conspicuously on the face or back of a certificate for shares issued by the corporation or on the information statement required under section 336. If at the time of the agreement the corporation has shares outstanding represented by certificates, the corporation shall recall the outstanding certificates and issue substitute certificates that comply with this subsection. The failure to note the existence of the agreement on the certificate or information statement does not affect the validity of the agreement or any action taken pursuant to it. Any purchaser of shares that did not have knowledge of the existence of the agreement at the time ownership is transferred is entitled to rescission of the purchase. A purchaser has knowledge of the existence of the agreement at the time ownership is transferred if the agreement's existence is noted on the certificate or information statement in compliance with this subsection and, if the shares are not represented by a certificate, the information statement is delivered to the purchaser at or before the time ownership of the shares is transferred. An action to enforce the right of rescission authorized under this subsection must be commenced within 90 days after discovery of the existence of the agreement or 2 years after the shares are transferred, whichever is earlier.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An agreement authorized under this section shall cease to be effective when shares of the corporation are listed on a national securities exchange or regularly traded in a market maintained by 1 or more members of a national or affiliated securities association.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If an agreement authorized under this section is no longer effective for any reason and is contained or referred to in the corporation's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the board may without shareholder action adopt an amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws to delete the agreement and any references to it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An agreement authorized under this section that limits the discretion or powers of the board shall relieve the directors of, and impose on the person or persons in which the discretion or powers are vested, liability for acts or omissions imposed by law on directors to the extent that the discretion or powers of the directors are limited by the agreement. The person or persons in whom the discretion or powers are vested are treated as a director or directors for purposes of any indemnification and any limitation on liability under section 209(1)(c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The existence or performance of an agreement authorized under this section is not grounds for imposing personal liability on any shareholder for the acts or debts of the corporation or for treating the corporation as if it were a partnership or unincorporated entity, even if the agreement or its performance results in failure to observe the corporate formalities otherwise applicable to the matters governed by the agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Dissolution pursuant to an agreement authorized in subsection (1)(g) shall be implemented by filing a certificate of dissolution under section 805.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Incorporators or subscribers for shares may act as shareholders with respect to an agreement authorized under this section if shares have not been issued when the agreement is made.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If holders of a class or series of stock or of bonds are entitled by the articles to elect 1 or more directors, this section applies, with respect to removal of a director so elected, to the vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of that class or series of stock or the holders of those bonds.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The material facts of the transaction and the director's or officer's interest were disclosed or known to the board, a committee of the board, or the independent director or directors, and the board, committee, or independent director or directors authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The material facts of the transaction and the director's or officer's interest were disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to vote and they authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) For purposes of subsection (1)(b), a transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it received the affirmative vote of the majority of the directors on the board or the committee who had no interest in the transaction, though less than a quorum, or all independent directors who had no interest in the transaction. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with an interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of the action taken under subsection (1)(b).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For purposes of subsection (1)(c), a transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it received the majority of votes cast by the holders of shares who did not have an interest in the transaction. A majority of the shares held by shareholders who did not have an interest in the transaction constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under subsection (1)(c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Satisfying the requirements of subsection (1) does not preclude other claims relating to a transaction in which a director or officer is determined to have an interest.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The board, by affirmative vote of a majority of directors in office and irrespective of any personal interest of any of them, may establish reasonable compensation of directors for services to the corporation as directors or officers, but approval of the shareholders is required if the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or another provision of this act requires that approval. Transactions pertaining to the compensation of directors for services to the corporation as directors or officers shall not be enjoined, set aside, or give rise to an award of damages or other sanctions in a proceeding by a shareholder or by or in the right of the corporation unless it is shown that the compensation was unreasonable at the time established.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A plan of merger or share exchange adopted by the board of each constituent corporation shall, except as provided in subsections (2)(f) and (g) and (3), be submitted for approval at a meeting of the shareholders.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) All of the following apply to the approval of a plan of merger or share exchange under this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The board must recommend the plan of merger or share exchange to the shareholders, or, if an offer described in subsection (3)(b) is made, recommend that the shareholders tender their shares to the offeror in response to the offer, unless section 529 applies or the board determines that because of conflict of interest, events occurring after the board adopts the plan, contractual obligations, or other special circumstances it should make no recommendation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If, because 1 or more of the exceptions described in subdivision (a) apply, the board does not make a recommendation described in subdivision (a), or the board recommends that the shareholders vote against the plan of merger or share exchange or recommends against a tender of shares by the shareholders in response to an offer described in subsection (3)(b), as applicable, the board must communicate to the shareholders the basis for its decision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The board may condition its submission of the proposed merger or share exchange on any basis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Notice of the shareholder meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record, whether or not entitled to vote at the meeting, within the time and in the manner provided in this act for giving notice of meetings of shareholders. The notice shall include or be accompanied by all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A copy or summary of the plan of merger or share exchange. If a summary of the plan is given, the notice shall state that a copy of the plan is available on request.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A statement informing shareholders that are entitled to dissent under section 762 that they have the right to dissent and to be paid the fair value of their shares by complying with the procedures set forth in sections 764 to 772.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) At the meeting, the shareholders shall vote on the proposed plan of merger or share exchange. The plan is approved if it receives the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote on the plan, and if a class or series is entitled to vote on the plan as a class, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the class or series. A class or series of shares is entitled to vote as a class in the case of a merger, if the plan of merger contains a provision that, if contained in a proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation, would entitle the class or series of shares to vote as a class, or, in the case of a share exchange, if the class or series is included in the exchange. A class or series of shares is not entitled to vote as a class in the case of a merger or share exchange, if the board of directors determines on a reasonable basis that the class or series is to receive consideration under the plan of merger or share exchange that has a fair value that is not less than the fair value of the shares of the class or series on the date of adoption of the plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Except as provided in section 754 or unless required by the articles of incorporation, action by the shareholders of the surviving corporation on a plan of merger is not required if all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation will not differ from its articles of incorporation before the merger.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Each shareholder of the surviving corporation whose shares were outstanding immediately before the effective date of the merger will hold the same number of shares, with identical designations, preferences, limitations, and relative rights, immediately after the merger.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Except as provided in section 754, action by the shareholders of the acquiring corporation on a plan of share exchange is not required.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Except as provided in subsection (3), a plan of merger or share exchange may provide for differing forms of consideration for holders of shares in the same class based on the election of the holders, the amount of shares held, or another reasonable basis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, approval of a plan of merger or share exchange by the shareholders of a corporation that has a class of voting stock registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under section 12 of the securities exchange act of 1934, 15 USC 78l, immediately before the execution of the plan of merger or share exchange is not required if all of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The plan of merger or share exchange meets both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) It expressly permits or requires the merger or share exchange to be effected under this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) It expressly provides that, if the merger or share exchange is to be effected under this subdivision, the merger or share exchange will be effected as soon as practicable after subdivision (f) is met.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Another party to the merger or share exchange, or a parent of another party to the merger or share exchange, makes an offer to purchase, on the terms provided in the plan of merger or share exchange, any and all of the outstanding shares of the corporation that would be entitled to vote on the plan or merger or share exchange if this subdivision did not apply, except that the offer may exclude shares of the corporation that are owned at the commencement of the offer by the corporation, the offeror, or a parent of the offeror or by any wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation, offeror, or parent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The offer discloses that the plan of merger or share exchange provides that the merger or share exchange will be effected as soon as practicable following the satisfaction of the requirement set forth in subdivision (f) and that the shares of the corporation that are not tendered in response to the offer will be treated as set forth in subdivision (h).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The offer remains open for at least 20 business days or for any other period that is required for tender offers under the rules or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under section 14(e) of the securities exchange act of 1934, 15 USC 78n(e).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The offeror purchases all shares that are properly tendered in response to the offer and not properly withdrawn.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Shares that meet any of the following are collectively entitled to cast at least the minimum number of votes on the merger or share exchange that, except for this subdivision, would be required under this act and under the articles of incorporation of the corporation for the approval of the merger or share exchange by the shareholders and by any other voting group that is entitled to vote on the merger or share exchange at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on the approval were present and voted:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Are purchased by the offeror in accordance with the offer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Are otherwise owned by the offeror or by any parent or wholly owned subsidiary of the offeror.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The offeror or a wholly owned subsidiary of the offeror merges with or into, or effects a share exchange in which it acquires shares of, the corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Each outstanding share of each class or series of shares of the corporation that the offeror is offering to purchase in accordance with the offer, and that is not purchased in accordance with the offer, is to be converted in the merger into, or into the right to receive, or is to be exchanged in the share exchange for, or for the right to receive, the same amount and kind of securities, interests, obligations, rights, cash, or other property to be paid or exchanged in accordance with the offer for each share of that class or series of shares that is tendered in response to the offer, except that shares of the corporation that are owned by the corporation or that are described in subdivision (f)(ii) or (iii) need not be converted into or exchanged for the consideration described in this subparagraph.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) As used in subsection (3):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Offer" means the offer described in subsection (3)(b).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Offeror" means a person that makes the offer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Parent" of an entity means a person that owns, directly or indirectly, through 1 or more wholly owned subsidiaries, all of the outstanding shares of or interests in that entity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Shares tendered in response to an offer are considered to have been "purchased" in accordance with the offer at the earliest time as of which both of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The offeror has irrevocably accepted those shares for payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) One of the following is met, as applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) In the case of shares represented by certificates, the offeror, or the offeror's designated depository or other agent, has physically received the certificates representing those shares.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) In the case of shares without certificates, those shares have been transferred into the account of the offeror or its designated depository or other agent, or an agent's message relating to those shares has been received by the offeror or its designated depository or other agent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) "Wholly owned subsidiary" of a person means an entity of or in which that person owns, directly or indirectly, through 1 or more wholly owned subsidiaries, all of the outstanding shares or interests.</div>

Compliance with this section requires that, to the extent that a reasonable estimate is possible, provision be made for those debts, obligations, and liabilities anticipated to arise after the effective date of dissolution. Provision need not be made for any debt, obligation, or liability that is or is reasonably anticipated to be barred under section 841a or 842a. The fact that corporate assets are insufficient to satisfy claims arising after a dissolution does not create a presumption that the corporation has failed to comply with this section. Adequate provision is deemed to have been made for any debt, obligation, or liability of the corporation if payment has been assumed or guaranteed in good faith by 1 or more financially responsible corporations, persons, or the United States government or agency of the United States government, and the provision, including the financial responsibility of the corporations or other persons, was determined in good faith and with reasonable care by the board to be adequate. After payment or adequate provision has been made for the corporation's debts, obligations, or liabilities, the remaining assets shall be distributed, except as otherwise provided in this section, in cash, in kind, or both in cash and in kind, to shareholders according to their respective rights and interests. A shareholder beneficially owning less than 5% of the outstanding shares may be paid in cash only, even if a shareholder beneficially owning 5% or more of the outstanding shares receives a distribution in kind, if the ownership of all shareholders receiving cash instead of distributions in kind without their written consent does not exceed 10% of all outstanding shares.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The corporate name of a domestic or foreign corporation formed or existing under or subject to this act shall conform to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Shall not contain a word or phrase, or abbreviation or derivative of a word or phrase, that indicates or implies that the corporation is formed for a purpose other than 1 or more of the purposes permitted by its articles of incorporation.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The corporate name of any other domestic corporation or foreign corporation authorized to conduct affairs in this state.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) A corporate name currently reserved, registered, or assumed under this act or the business corporation act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The name of any domestic limited partnership or foreign limited partnership as filed or registered under the Michigan revised uniform limited partnership act, 1982 PA 213, MCL 449.1101 to 449.2108, or any name currently reserved or assumed under that act.</div>

If in the judgment of the administrator that name would comply with the provisions of subsection (1), that subsection does not prevent the administrator from issuing the foreign corporation a certificate of authority to conduct affairs in this state. The certificate issued to the foreign corporation shall be issued in the name applied for and the foreign corporation shall use that name in all its dealings with the administrator and in the conduct of its affairs in this state.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in section 212 or otherwise prohibited by law, a domestic or foreign corporation may conduct its affairs under any assumed name or names other than its corporate name, by filing a certificate stating the true name of the corporation and the assumed name under which its affairs are to be conducted. A certificate of assumed name is effective, unless sooner terminated by filing a certificate of termination or by the dissolution or withdrawal of the corporation, for a period that expires on December 31 of the fifth full calendar year following the year in which it was filed. A certificate of assumed name may be extended for additional consecutive periods of 5 full calendar years each by filing similar certificates not earlier than 90 days preceding the expiration of the initial or a subsequent 5-year period. The administrator shall notify the corporation of the impending expiration of the certificate of assumed name not later than 90 days before the expiration of the initial or subsequent 5-year period. If authorized by the corporation, the administrator may electronically transmit the notice to the resident agent of the corporation. A certificate of assumed name filed under this section does not create substantive rights to the use of a particular assumed name.</div>

The use of an assumed name transferred under this subsection may continue for the remaining effective period of the certificate of assumed name on file before the merger, and the surviving entity may terminate or extend the certificate of assumed name under subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A corporation that survives a merger may use as an assumed name the corporate name of a merging corporation, or the name of any other entity that participates in the merger under section 735 or 736a, by filing a certificate of assumed name under subsection (1) or by providing for the use of the name as an assumed name in the certificate of merger. The surviving corporation also may file a certificate of assumed name under subsection (1) or provide in the certificate of merger for the use as an assumed name of an assumed name of a merging entity that is not transferred under subsection (3). A provision in the certificate of merger under this subsection is considered a new certificate of assumed name.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A business organization into which a corporation has converted under section 745 may use an assumed name of the converting corporation, if the corporation has a certificate of assumed name for that assumed name on file with the administrator before the conversion, by providing for the use of the name as an assumed name in the certificate of conversion. The use of an assumed name under this subsection may continue for the remaining effective period of the certificate of assumed name on file before the conversion, and the surviving business organization may terminate or extend the certificate of assumed name under subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A corporation into which 1 or more business organizations have converted under section 746 may use as an assumed name the name of any business organization converting into that corporation, or use as an assumed name an assumed name of that business organization, by filing a certificate of assumed name under subsection (1) or by providing for the use of that name or assumed name as an assumed name of the corporation in the certificate of conversion.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a subscriber defaults in payment of an installment or call or other amount due under a subscription agreement, including an amount that becomes due as a result of a default in performance of any provision of a subscription agreement, the corporation has the following rights and duties:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) It may collect the amount due in the same manner as any other debt owing to it. If the corporation is organized on a stock basis and if the articles of incorporation or bylaws of a corporation permit the transfer of shares, the corporation may at any time before full satisfaction of the claim or a judgment sell the shares in any reasonable manner that is consistent with the articles of incorporation and bylaws. The corporation shall give notice of the time and place of a public sale or of the time after which a private sale may occur, and a written statement of the amount due on each share, to the subscriber personally or by registered or certified mail at least 20 days before the time stated in the notice. The corporation shall pay any excess of net proceeds realized over the amount due plus interest to the subscriber. If the sale is made in good faith, in a reasonable manner and after the notice required in this subdivision, the corporation may recover the difference between the amount due plus interest and the net proceeds of the sale. A good faith purchaser for value acquires title to the sold shares free of any right of the subscriber even if the corporation fails to comply with 1 or more of the requirements of this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) It may rescind the subscription, with the effect provided in section 310, and may recover damages for breach of contract. In the case of transferable shares of a corporation organized on a stock basis, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount, the measure of damages is the difference between the fair market value at the time and place of tender of the shares and the unpaid contract price. A subscription agreement may also provide for liquidated damages in any reasonable amount. The subscriber may have restitution of the amount by which the sum of payments exceeds the corporation's damages for breach of contract, whether fixed by agreement or judgment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The rights and duties set forth in this section are cumulative so far as is consistent with entitling the corporation to a full and single recovery of the amount due or its damages. A subscription agreement may limit the rights and remedies of the corporation set forth in this section, and may add to them so far as is consistent with this subsection.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The shareholders of a corporation organized on a stock basis do not have a preemptive right to acquire the corporation's unissued shares except to the extent provided in the articles of incorporation or by agreement between the corporation and 1 or more shareholders.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a statement is included in the articles of incorporation or an agreement described in subsection (1) that the corporation elects to have preemptive rights, or words of similar import are included in the articles or agreement, the following principles apply except to the extent the articles of incorporation or agreement expressly provide otherwise:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The shareholders of the corporation have a preemptive right, granted on uniform terms and conditions prescribed by the board, to provide a fair and reasonable opportunity to exercise the right to acquire proportional amounts of the corporation's unissued shares if the board decides to issue them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A shareholder may waive his or her preemptive right. A waiver evidenced by a writing is irrevocable even though it is not supported by consideration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) There is no preemptive right with respect to any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Shares that are authorized in the articles of incorporation and are issued within 6 months after the effective date of incorporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Shares that are not issued for money.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Holders of shares of any class that do not have general voting rights but do have preferential rights to distributions or assets do not have preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Holders of shares of any class that have general voting rights but do not have preferential rights to distributions or assets do not have preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class with preferential rights to distributions or assets unless the shares with preferential rights are convertible into or carry a right to subscribe for or acquire shares without preferential rights.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Shares that are subject to preemptive rights that are not acquired by shareholders may be issued to any person for a period of 1 year after the shares are offered to shareholders at a consideration set by the board that is not lower than the consideration set for the exercise of preemptive rights. An offer at a lower consideration or after the expiration of 1 year is subject to the shareholders' preemptive rights.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The preemptive rights, if any, whether created by statute or common law, of shareholders of a corporation formed before January 1, 1973, are not affected by subsections (1) and (2). A corporation may alter or abolish its shareholders' preemptive rights by an amendment to its articles of incorporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) As used in this section, "shares" includes a security convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>450.2344 Acquisition of own shares or memberships; amendment of articles of incorporation.</B><P>Sec. 344.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to restrictions imposed under this act or the articles of incorporation, a corporation that is organized on a stock or membership basis may acquire its own shares or memberships. Except as provided in subsection (4), those shares or memberships constitute authorized but unissued shares or memberships.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the articles of incorporation prohibit reissue of any shares or memberships acquired under subsection (1), the board by resolution shall adopt and file any necessary amendment to the articles of incorporation to reduce the number of authorized shares or memberships accordingly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A corporation shall not acquire its own shares or memberships by purchase, redemption, or otherwise unless after the acquisition there remain outstanding shares or memberships that possess, collectively, voting rights or unless the articles of incorporation have been amended to provide that the corporation is organized on a directorship basis after the acquisition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A corporation that acquires its own shares or memberships may grant a security interest in the shares or memberships as security for the payment of the purchase price of the shares or memberships. Any shares or memberships acquired by the corporation in which it has granted a security interest are not canceled and do not constitute authorized but unissued shares or memberships until the corporation pays the purchase price. If a corporation has granted a security interest in its own shares or memberships, the shares or memberships shall not be voted directly or indirectly and are not counted in determining the total number of issued shares or members entitled to vote at any given time, except to the extent provided by the agreement creating the security interest in the event of default. When the purchase price is paid, the shares or memberships are canceled and constitute authorized but unissued shares or memberships. If the articles of incorporation prohibit reissue of canceled shares or memberships, then the board by resolution shall adopt and file any amendment to the articles of incorporation required under subsection (2).</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>450.2345 Distributions to shareholders or members.</B><P>Sec. 345.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A board may authorize and the corporation may make distributions to its shareholders or members that are permitted in section 301, subject to subsection (3) and any restriction in the articles of incorporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the board does not fix the record date for determining shareholders or members entitled to a distribution, other than a distribution involving a purchase, redemption, or acquisition of the corporation's shares or memberships, the record date is the date the board authorizes the distribution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A corporation shall not make a distribution if after giving it effect the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as the debts become due in the usual course of business, or the corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus, unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise, the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights on dissolution of shareholders or members whose preferential rights are superior to those that receive the distribution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The board may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (3) on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances, on a fair valuation, or on any other method that is reasonable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The effect of a distribution under subsection (3) is measured at the following times:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Except as provided in subsection (7), for distributions by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation's shares or memberships, as of the earlier of the date money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the corporation, or the date the shareholder or member ceases to be a shareholder or member with respect to the acquired shares or ceases to be a member.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For any other distribution of indebtedness, as of the date the indebtedness is authorized if distribution occurs within 120 days after the date of authorization or the date the indebtedness is distributed if it occurs more than 120 days after the date of authorization.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For any other purpose, as of the date the distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within 120 days after the date of authorization or the date the payment is made if it occurs more than 120 days after the date of authorization.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A corporation's indebtedness to a shareholder or member that is incurred by reason of a distribution made under this section is at parity with the corporation's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors, except as otherwise agreed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a corporation acquires its shares or memberships in exchange for an obligation to make future payments, and distribution of an obligation would otherwise be prohibited under subsection (3) at the time it is made, the corporation may issue the obligation and all of the following apply: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The portion of the obligation that could have been distributed without violating subsection (3) is treated as indebtedness as described in subsection (6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) All of the following apply to the portion of the obligation that exceeds the amount treated as indebtedness under subdivision (a):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) At any time before the due date of the obligation, payments of principal and interest may be made as a distribution to the extent that a distribution may then be made under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) At any time on or after the due date, the obligation to pay principal and interest is considered distributed and treated as indebtedness described in subsection (6) to the extent that a distribution may be made at that time under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Unless otherwise provided in the agreement for the acquisition of the shares, the obligation is a liability or debt for purposes of determining whether distributions other than payments on the obligation may be made under this section, except for purposes of determining whether distributions may be made with respect to shares that have preferential rights superior to those of shares acquired in exchange for the obligation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The enforceability of a guaranty or other undertaking by a third party that relates to a distribution is not affected by the prohibition of the distribution under subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If a claim is made to recover a distribution that violates subsection (3), or if a violation of subsection (3) is raised as a defense to a claim based on a distribution, this section does not prevent the person that received the distribution from asserting a right of rescission or other legal or equitable rights.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>A corporation shall hold an annual meeting of its shareholders or members, to elect directors and conduct any other business that may come before the meeting, on a date designated in the bylaws, unless the shareholders or members act by written consent under section 407 or by ballot under section 408 or 409. A failure to hold the annual meeting at the designated time, or to elect a sufficient number of directors at the meeting or any adjournment of the meeting, does not affect otherwise valid corporate acts or work a forfeiture or give cause for dissolution of the corporation, except as provided in section 823. If the annual meeting is not held on the date designated for the meeting, the board shall cause the meeting to be held as soon after that date as is convenient. If the annual meeting is not held for 90 days after the date designated for the meeting, or if no date is designated for 15 months after formation of the corporation or after its last annual meeting, the circuit court for the county in which the principal place of business or registered office of the corporation is located, on application of a shareholder or member, may summarily order that the corporation hold the meeting or the election, or both, and that it is held at the time and place, after the notice, and for the transaction of the business that is designated in the order. At any meeting ordered by the court under this section, the shareholders or members that are present in person or by proxy and that have voting powers constitute a quorum for transaction of the business designated in the order.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Notice of the purposes of a meeting shall include notice of any proposal a shareholder or member intends to propose, if that proposal is a proper subject for shareholder or member action and the shareholder or member notified the corporation in writing of the shareholder's or member's intention to present the proposal at the meeting.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a meeting of the shareholders or members is adjourned to another time or place, it is not necessary, unless the bylaws otherwise provide, to give notice of the adjourned meeting if the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. If after an adjournment the board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, the corporation shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each shareholder or member of record on the new record date that is entitled to notice under subsection (1).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A shareholder's or member's attendance at a meeting, in person or by proxy, will result in both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Waiver of objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder or member at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Waiver of objection to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder or member objects to considering the matter when it is presented.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) This section does not prohibit a corporation from conducting a meeting of its shareholders or members without notice or with the notice prescribed in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, if the meeting is for a purpose or purposes that do not involve the election of directors or the taking of other actions involving control or governance of the corporation for which a vote of the shareholders or members is required under this act, the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, or an agreement under section 488.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A corporation may provide in its articles of incorporation or in bylaws that are approved by the shareholders or members that any action the shareholders or members are required or permitted to take at an annual or special meeting, including the election of directors, may be taken without a meeting if the corporation provides a ballot to each shareholder or member that is entitled to vote on the action in the manner provided in section 404 for providing notice of meetings of shareholders or members. A provision in the articles of incorporation or bylaws authorizing shareholder or member action by ballot shall not preclude calling or holding annual or special meetings of shareholders or members.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The ballot provided to shareholders or members under subsection (1) shall meet all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Set forth each proposed action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Provide an opportunity for the shareholders or members to vote for or against each proposed action.</div>

Except as otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, an invalid ballot, an abstention, or the submission of a ballot marked "abstain" with respect to any action does not constitute a vote cast on that action.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Subject to subsection (6), a corporation that provides in its articles of incorporation or bylaws for shareholder or member action by ballot may establish procedures that enable shareholders or members or a specified number or percentage of shareholders or members to include proposed actions in a ballot.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in this subsection, for the purpose of determining which shareholders or members are entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of shareholders or members, notice of an adjournment of a meeting, or notice of or to cast a ballot at a polling place, and for the purpose of determining the shareholders or members that are entitled to receive and to cast a ballot under section 408, the bylaws may provide for establishing a record date, or, in the absence of a bylaws provision, the board shall by resolution establish a record date. If the bylaws establish a record date, the board shall comply with the bylaws in establishing the record date. The record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board. The record date shall not be more than 60 or fewer than 10 days before the date of the meeting or the first day on which a shareholder or member may cast a ballot at a polling place under section 409. If the vote is by ballot under section 408, the record date shall be not more than 60 or fewer than 20 days before the last date on which the corporation must receive the ballots for them to be counted. If a record date is not fixed, the record date for determination of shareholders or members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders or members or to cast a ballot at a polling place is the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if no notice is given, the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held or the day next preceding the first day on which a shareholder or member may cast a ballot at a polling place under section 409. If the vote is by ballot under section 408, and a record date is not fixed, the record date for determination of which shareholders or members are entitled to receive and cast a ballot is the close of business of the day next preceding the day on which the corporation provides the ballot to the shareholders or members under section 408(1). If a determination of which shareholders or members of record are entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders or members is made under this section, the determination applies to any adjournment of the meeting, unless the board establishes a new record date under this section for the adjourned meeting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) For the purpose of determining which shareholders or members are entitled to express consent to or to dissent from a proposal without a meeting under section 407, the bylaws may provide for establishing a record date. The record date shall not be more than 60 days before the proposed effective date of the shareholder or member action. If the bylaws do not establish a record date, the board may establish a record date that does not precede the date the board adopts the resolution establishing the record date and is not more than 10 days after the board resolution. If a record date is not established and prior action by the board is required with respect to any corporate action to be taken without a meeting under section 407, the record date is the close of business on the day on which the resolution of the board is adopted. If a record date is not fixed and prior action by the board is not required, the record date is the first date on which a signed written consent is delivered to the corporation under section 407.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For the purpose of determining shareholders or members that are entitled to receive payment of a share dividend, distribution, or allotment of a right or for the purpose of any other action, the bylaws may provide for establishing a record date, or, in the absence of a bylaws provision, the board may establish a record date. The record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution establishing the record date is adopted by the board. The date shall not be more than 60 days before the payment of the share dividend, distribution, or allotment of a right or other action. If a record date is not established, the record date is the close of business on the day on which the resolution of the board relating to the corporate action is adopted.</div>

As used in this subsection, "proper purpose" means a purpose that is reasonably related to a person's interest as a shareholder or member. A shareholder or member must deliver a demand under this subsection to the corporation at its registered office in this state or at its principal place of business.

If the shareholder or member seeks to inspect the books and records other than its stock ledger or list of shareholders or members, the shareholder or member must establish that the shareholder or member has complied with this section concerning the form and manner of making demand for inspection of the documents, that the inspection is for a proper purpose, and that the documents sought are directly connected with the purpose. If the shareholder or member seeks to inspect the corporation's stock ledger or list of shareholders or members and establishes that the stockholder or member has complied with this section concerning the form and manner of making demand for the inspection of the documents, the corporation has the burden of proof to establish that the inspection that is sought is for an improper purpose or that the records sought are not directly connected with the person's purpose. In its discretion, the court may order the corporation to permit the shareholder or member to inspect the corporation's stock ledger, a list of shareholders or members, and its other books and records, prescribe conditions and limitations on the inspection, and award other or further relief that the court considers just and proper. The court may order books, documents and records, pertinent extracts, or duly authenticated copies to be brought to this state and kept in this state and prescribe terms and conditions on those obligations.</div>

The director may apply to the circuit court of the county in which the principal place of business or registered office of the corporation is located for an order to compel the inspection. In its discretion, the court may order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and all books and records, prescribe conditions and limitations on the inspection, and award other and further relief that the court considers just and proper.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the court orders inspection of the records demanded under subsection (3) or (4), it shall also order the corporation to pay the shareholder's, member's, or director's costs, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred to obtain the order unless the corporation proves that it failed to permit the inspection in good faith because it had a reasonable basis to doubt the right of the shareholder, member, or director to inspect the records demanded.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A holder of a voting trust certificate representing shares of, or membership in, the corporation is considered a shareholder or member for purposes of this section and section 485.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Opening the stock ledger, lists of shareholder or members, lists of donors or donations, or its other books and records for inspection would impair the rights of privacy or free association of the shareholders or members.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Opening the stock ledger, lists of shareholder or members, lists of donors or donations, or its other books and records for inspection would impair the lawful purposes of the corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Opening lists of donors or donations for inspection is not in the best interests of the corporation or its donors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A corporation that limits inspection of lists of its shareholders or members under subsection (7) shall provide a reasonable way for shareholders or members to communicate with all other shareholders or members concerning the election of directors and other affairs of the corporation. A corporation described in this subsection may require a shareholder or member that wishes to communicate with other shareholders or members under this subsection to pay the reasonable costs to cover the cost of labor and materials and third-party charges incurred by the corporation in doing so.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Proper purpose" means a purpose that is reasonably related to a person's interest as a shareholder or member of a corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Right to inspect records" includes the right to copy and make extracts from the records of a corporation and, if reasonable, the right to require the corporation to supply copies made by photographic, xerographic, or other means.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) It restricts the discretion or powers of the board. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) It governs the authorization or making of distributions permitted under section 301 whether or not in proportion to the membership interest or shares held, subject to limitations in sections 345 and 855 pertaining to the protection of creditors. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) It establishes who shall be directors or officers of the corporation, or the terms of office or manner of selection or removal of directors or officers of the corporation. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) In general or in regard to specific matters, it governs the exercise or division of voting power by or between the members or shareholders and directors or by or among any of the members, shareholders, or directors, including, but not limited to, use of weighted voting rights or restrictions on the voting rights of particular members, shareholders, or directors. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) It establishes the terms and conditions of any agreement for the transfer or use of property or the provision of services between the corporation and any member, shareholder, director, officer, or employee of the corporation or among the members, shareholders, directors, officers, or employees of the corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) It transfers to 1 or more members, shareholders, or other persons all or part of the authority to exercise the corporate powers or to manage the business and affairs of the corporation, including, but not limited to, the resolution of any issue about which there exists a deadlock among directors, members, or shareholders.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) It requires dissolution of the corporation at the request of 1 or more of the members, shareholders, or directors or if a specified event or contingency occurs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) It establishes that shares or memberships may be assessable by the corporation, including the procedures for an assessment and the consequences of a failure by a shareholder or member to pay an assessment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) It otherwise governs the exercise of the corporate powers or the management of the business and affairs of the corporation or the relationship among the shareholders, the members, the directors, and the corporation, or among any of the shareholders, members, or directors, and is not contrary to public policy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An agreement that is authorized under this section shall meet both of the following requirements:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) It is included in either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws that is approved by all members or shareholders or all directors of a corporation that is organized on a directorship basis at the time of the agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A written agreement that is signed by all members or shareholders or all directors of a corporation that is organized on a directorship basis at the time of the agreement and that is disclosed to the corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Is subject to amendment only by all members or shareholders or by all directors of a corporation that is organized on a directorship basis at the time of the amendment, unless the agreement provides otherwise or the amendment involves a provision of the articles of incorporation described in section 209(1)(f). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A corporation shall conspicuously note the existence of an agreement authorized under this section on the face or back of any certificate of membership or for shares issued by the corporation or on the information statement required under section 336. If at the time of the agreement the corporation has memberships or shares outstanding represented by certificates, the corporation shall recall the outstanding certificates and issue substitute certificates that comply with this subsection. A failure to note the existence of the agreement on the certificate or information statement does not affect the validity of the agreement or any action taken under the agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Any person that becomes a member of a corporation organized on a membership basis, a shareholder of a corporation organized on a stock basis, or a director of a corporation organized on a directorship basis and did not have knowledge of the existence of an agreement authorized under this section at the time the person became a member, shareholder, or director, may elect to resign as a member, shareholder, or director, may elect to rescind the transfer of any membership or shares, or may elect to maintain an action to terminate the agreement. For purposes of this subsection, a person is considered to have knowledge of an agreement authorized under this section if at the time the person becomes a member, shareholder, or director, the agreement is included in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, the agreement's existence is noted on the certificate or information statement provided under subsection (3), or a copy or a written summary of the agreement is furnished to the person before the person becomes a member, shareholder, or director. A person must commence an action to enforce a right of rescission or to terminate the agreement within 90 days after discovery of the existence of the agreement or 2 years after the person becomes a shareholder, member, or director, whichever is earlier. In an action or suit to terminate the agreement, the court in which the action is brought shall terminate the agreement if the court determines that the agreement is materially inconsistent with or detrimental to carrying out the purposes of the corporation, materially impairs rights or interests the person that brought the action or suit would reasonably have expected to have acquired in becoming a member, shareholder, or director, or is inconsistent with 1 or more of the limitations under subsection (11).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If an agreement authorized in this section ceases to be effective for any reason and is contained or referred to in the corporation's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the board may without shareholder or member action adopt an amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws to delete the agreement and any references to it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An agreement authorized under this section that limits the discretion or powers of the board shall relieve the directors of, and impose on the person or persons in which the discretion or powers are vested, liability for acts or omissions imposed by law on directors to the extent that the discretion or powers of the directors are limited by the agreement. The person or persons in which the discretion or powers are vested are treated as a director or directors for purposes of any indemnification and any limitation on liability under section 209.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The existence or performance of an agreement authorized under this section is not grounds for imposing personal liability on any member, shareholder, or other person for the acts or debts of the corporation or for treating the corporation as if it were a partnership or unincorporated entity, even if the agreement or its performance results in failure to observe the corporate formalities otherwise applicable to the matters governed by the agreement. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Filing a certificate of dissolution under section 805 is required to implement a dissolution under an agreement authorized under subsection (1)(g).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Incorporators or subscribers for memberships or shares may act as members or shareholders with respect to an agreement authorized under this section if the corporation has not issued memberships or shares at the time the agreement is made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A failure to satisfy the unanimity requirement of subsection (2) with respect to an agreement authorized under this section does not invalidate any agreement or any provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws that would otherwise be valid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) An agreement under this section is not effective to do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) To authorize distributions that are not permitted under section 301.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) To allow property that is held for charitable or other public purposes to be used for private benefit, through the payment or excessive compensation for goods or services, or in any other manner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) To allow the use of corporate property in a manner that is materially inconsistent with the purposes of the corporation or a valid restriction imposed by donors.</div>

In awarding damages under this subsection to a shareholder or member, the shareholder or member is not considered to have any interest in charitable or other assets of the corporation that would not be distributable to shareholders or members of the corporation in a dissolution under section 855.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) As used in this section, "willfully unfair and oppressive conduct" with respect to a member or shareholder means a continuing course of conduct or a significant action or series of actions that substantially interferes with the rights or interests of the member or shareholder as a member or shareholder.

A corporation shall make a determination and evaluation under this subsection in 1 of the following ways:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) By a majority vote of a quorum of the board that consists of directors who are not parties or threatened to be made parties to the action, suit, or proceeding.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) By the board in 1 of the following ways:</div>

In connection with an action or suit by or in the right of the corporation described in section 562, indemnification under this subsection may be for expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred. In connection with an action, suit, or proceeding other than an action, suit, or proceeding by or in the right of the corporation, described in section 561, a corporation may indemnify a director under this subsection for expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred, and for judgments, penalties, fines, and amounts paid in settlement that are actually and reasonably incurred.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) All of the following apply if a corporation is dissolved:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The corporation shall pay or make provision for its debts, obligations, and liabilities. Compliance with this subdivision requires that, to the extent that a reasonable estimate is possible, provision is made for those debts, obligations, and liabilities that are anticipated to arise after the effective date of dissolution. A corporation is not required to make provision for any debt, obligation, or liability that is or is reasonably anticipated to be barred under section 841a or 842a. The fact that corporate assets are insufficient to satisfy claims that arise after a dissolution does not create a presumption that the corporation has failed to comply with this subdivision. A corporation is considered to have made adequate provision for any debt, obligation, or liability of the corporation if payment is assumed or guaranteed in good faith by 1 or more financially responsible corporations, other persons, or the United States government or an agency of the United States government and the provision, including the financial responsibility of the corporations or other persons, was determined in good faith and with reasonable care by the board to be adequate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the corporation holds any assets subject to a condition that requires return, transfer, or conveyance, and the condition occurs by reason of the dissolution, the corporation shall return, transfer, or convey those assets in compliance with those conditions. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the corporation received and holds any assets that are subject to limitations that permit their use only for charitable, religious, eleemosynary, benevolent, educational, or similar purposes, but that are not held subject to a condition that requires return, transfer, or conveyance by reason of the dissolution under subdivision (b), the corporative shall transfer or convey those assets in a manner that complies with any provisions in the articles of incorporation or bylaws that designate 1 or more recipients or establish a mechanism for determining 1 or more recipients that are domestic or foreign corporations, societies, or organizations, including governmental agencies, that are engaged in activities that further those purposes. If the articles of incorporation or bylaws do not contain a provision described in this subdivision, the corporation shall transfer or convey those assets to 1 or more domestic or foreign corporations, societies, or organizations, including governmental agencies, that are engaged in activities that are substantially similar to or consistent with those of the dissolving corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The corporation shall distribute any other assets in a manner that complies with any provisions of the articles of incorporation or the bylaws that determine the distributive rights of shareholders or members, or any class or classes of shareholders or members, or provide for distribution to others. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the corporation may distribute assets that are subject to this subdivision in cash, in kind, or both in cash and in kind, to shareholders, members, or others according to their respective rights and interests.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The corporation distributes any remaining assets to any persons specified in a plan of distribution adopted by the corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If any assets of a dissolved corporation are not subject to any provision for the distribution of assets described in subsection (1), those remaining escheat to the state.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   On and after July 1, 1997, except as otherwise provided in subsection (2), in equal shares to all members. A membership interest held by 2 or more persons, whether as fiduciaries, members of a partnership, tenants in common, joint tenants, tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, is considered as held by 1 member for an allocation under this subdivision.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Except as provided in an operating agreement, a member, regardless of the nature of the member's contribution, has no right to demand and receive a distribution from a limited liability company in any form other than cash, and a member may not be compelled to accept from a limited liability company a distribution of an asset in kind to the extent that the percentage of the asset distributed to the member exceeds a percentage of that asset that is equal to the percentage in which the member shares in distributions from the limited liability company.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 307.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5), a distribution shall not be made if, after giving the distribution effect, 1 or more of the following situations would occur:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The limited liability company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The limited liability company's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus, unless an operating agreement provides otherwise, the amount that would be needed, if the limited liability company were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights of other members upon dissolution that are superior to the rights of the member or members receiving the distribution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The limited liability company may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (1) on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable under the circumstances, on a fair valuation, or on another method that is reasonable under the circumstances.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The effect of a distribution under subsection (1) is measured at the following times:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Except as provided in subsection (5), in the case of a distribution to a withdrawing member, as of the earlier of the date money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the limited liability company, or the date the member ceases to be a member.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   In the case of any other distribution of indebtedness, as of the date the indebtedness is authorized if distribution occurs within 120 days after the date of authorization, or the date the indebtedness is distributed if it occurs more than 120 days after the date of authorization.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   In all other cases, as of the date the distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within 120 days after the date of authorization, or the date the payment is made if it occurs more than 120 days after the date of authorization.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   At the time a member becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the member has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the limited liability company with respect to the distribution. A company's indebtedness to a member incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the company's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors except as otherwise agreed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the limited liability company distributes an obligation to make future payments to a withdrawing member, and distribution of the obligation would otherwise be prohibited under subsection (1) at the time it is made, the company may issue the obligation and the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The portion of the obligation that could have been distributed without violating subsection (1) is indebtedness to the withdrawing member under subsection (4).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   All of the following apply to the portion of the obligation that exceeds the amount of the obligation that is indebtedness to the withdrawing member under subdivision (a):</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   At any time prior to the due date of the obligation, payments of principal and interest may be made as a distribution to the extent that a distribution may then be made under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   At any time on or after the due date, the obligation to pay principal and interest is considered distributed and treated as indebtedness described in subsection (4) to the extent that a distribution may then be made under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Unless otherwise provided in an agreement with the withdrawing member, the obligation is considered a liability or debt for purposes of determining whether distributions other than payments on the obligation may be made under this section, except for purposes of determining whether distributions may be made to members having preferential rights superior to the rights of the withdrawing member.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The enforceability of a guaranty or other undertaking by a third party relating to a distribution is not affected by the prohibition of the distribution under subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If a claim is made to recover a distribution made contrary to subsection (1) or if a violation of subsection (1) is raised as a defense to a claim based upon a distribution, this section does not prevent the person receiving the distribution from asserting a right of rescission or other legal or equitable rights.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Each member or manager held liable under subsection (1) for an unlawful distribution is entitled to contribution from each other member or manager who could be held liable under subsection (1) or (3).

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An operating agreement may establish and allocate the voting rights of members and may provide that certain members or groups of members have only limited or no voting rights. If an operating agreement does not address voting rights, votes are allocated as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Before July 1, 1997, the members of a limited liability company shall vote in proportion to their shares of distributions of the company, as determined under section 303.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) On and after July 1, 1997, except as otherwise provided in subsection (2), each member of a limited liability company has 1 vote. For purposes of this subdivision, a membership interest held by 2 or more persons, whether as fiduciaries, members of a partnership, tenants in common, joint tenants, tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, is considered held by 1 member.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a limited liability company in existence before July 1, 1997 allocated votes on the basis of subsection (1)(a), the company shall continue to allocate votes pursuant to subsection (1)(a) until the allocation is changed by an operating agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a membership interest that has voting rights is held by 2 or more persons, whether as fiduciaries, members of a partnership, tenants in common, joint tenants, tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, the voting of the interest shall be in accordance with the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship if a copy of that instrument or order is furnished to the limited liability company. If an instrument or order is not furnished to the limited liability company, 1 of the following applies to the voting of that membership interest:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If an operating agreement applies to the voting of the membership interest, the vote shall be in accordance with that operating agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If an operating agreement does not apply to the voting of the membership interest and only 1 of the persons that hold the membership interest votes, that person's vote determines the voting of the membership interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If an operating agreement does not apply to the voting of the membership interest and 2 or more of the persons that hold the membership interest vote, the vote of a majority determines the voting of the membership interest, and if there is no majority, the voting of the membership interest is divided among those voting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Only members of a limited liability company, and not its managers, may authorize the following actions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The dissolution of the limited liability company under section 801(c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Merger of the limited liability company under sections 701 through 706.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Conversion of the limited liability company under section 708.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as otherwise provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement, members have the voting rights provided in section 409 regarding transactions in which a manager or agent has an interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, the sale, exchange, lease, or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of a limited liability company, other than in the ordinary course of business, may be authorized only by a vote of the members entitled to vote.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The articles of organization or an operating agreement may provide for additional voting rights of members of the limited liability company.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Unless the vote of a greater percentage of the voting interest of members is required by this act, the articles of organization, or an operating agreement, a vote of a majority in interest of the members entitled to vote is required to approve any matter submitted for a vote of the members.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a court of competent jurisdiction receives an application from any judgment creditor of a member of a limited liability company, the court may charge the membership interest of the member with payment of the unsatisfied amount of judgment with interest. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a limited liability company is served with a charging order and notified of the terms of that order, then to the extent described in the order, the member's judgment creditor described in the order is entitled to receive only any distribution or distributions to which the judgment creditor is entitled with respect to the member's membership interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) This act does not deprive any member of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to the member's membership interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement or admitted as a member under section 501, a judgment creditor of a member that obtains a charging order does not become a member of the limited liability company, and the member that is the subject of the charging order remains a member of the limited liability company and retains all rights and powers of membership except the right to receive distributions to the extent charged.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A charging order is a lien on the membership interest of the member that is the subject of the charging order.

Any order of dismissal shall be without prejudice to the recommencement of the action, suit, or proceeding by the foreign limited liability company after it obtains a certificate of authority.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The failure of a foreign limited liability company to obtain a certificate of authority to transact business in this state does not impair the validity of any contract or act of the foreign limited liability company or prevent the foreign limited liability company from defending any action, suit, or proceeding in a court of this state.</DIV>

The penalty shall not exceed $10,000.00. Each manager, member, or authorized person who authorizes, directs, or participates in the transaction of business in this state on behalf of a foreign limited liability company that does not have a certificate is subject to a civil penalty, payable to the state, not to exceed $10,000.00.</DIV>
