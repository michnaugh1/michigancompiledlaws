<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The department shall issue an initial or renewal license or permit for regulated activities described in sections 31 and 33, other than a grade A dairy farm, a bulk milk hauler/sampler, or a certified industry farm inspector, not later than 90 days after the applicant files a completed application. Receipt of the application is considered the date the application is received by any agency or department of this state. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the application is considered incomplete by the department, the department shall notify the applicant in writing, or make information electronically available, within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The 90-day period is tolled upon notification by the department of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the department. The determination of the completeness of an application does not operate as an approval of the application for the license or permit and does not confer eligibility of an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license or permit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the department fails to issue or deny a license or permit within the time required by this section, the department shall return the license or permit fee and shall reduce the license or permit fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. The failure to issue or deny a license or permit within the time required under this section does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and that application, upon completion, must be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based upon the fact that the license or permit fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) As used in this section, "completed application" means an application that is complete on its face and submitted with any applicable licensing or permit fees and fines as well as any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of this state. Under appropriate circumstances, completed application includes the completion of construction or renovation of any facility and the passing of a satisfactory inspection.</div>

Receipt of the application is considered the date the application is received by an agency or department of this state. If the application is considered incomplete by the department, the department shall notify the applicant in writing, or make the information electronically available, within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The 90-day period is tolled upon notification by the department of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the department. The determination of the completeness of an application is not an approval of the application for the license or permit and does not confer eligibility of an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license or permit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the department fails to issue or deny a license or permit within the time required by this section, the department shall return the license or permit fee and shall reduce the license or permit fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. The failure to issue a license or permit within the time required under this section does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and that application, upon completion, must be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based upon the fact that the license fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) As used in this section, "completed application" means an application complete on its face and submitted with any applicable licensing or permit fees and fines as well as any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of this state.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the milk buyer determines that the producer's milk contains somatic cells, temperature, or bacteria at a level exceeding department limits for somatic cells, temperature, or bacteria in 2 of the 4 most recent tests of the producer's milk, notify the department and the producer of that determination.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Obtain a subsequent sample of the producer's milk not less than 3 days or more than 21 days after the department inspects the producer's facility pursuant to this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   If the sample described in subdivision (c) contains somatic cells, or temperature or bacteria at a level exceeding department limits, notify the department and refrain from obtaining any further milk from the producer once the director suspends the producer's permit and until the permit is reinstated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The buyer shall examine sediment levels in each producer's milk using procedures described in standard methods, referenced in 7 C.F.R. part 58. Samples shall be from a bulk milk tank sample or from 1 or more cans. Sediment content shall be based on comparison with applicable charts of the United States department of agriculture sediment standards for milk and milk products, dated 1977, incorporated by reference. The buyer shall report the results of these sediment tests to the department.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   Immediately following receipt of notice described in subsection (8)(b), the department shall inspect a milk producer's facility and attempt to determine and remedy the cause of an illegal somatic cell count, temperature, or bacteria. The department shall provide the milk producer with a written warning notice of intent to suspend permit, and the notice shall remain in effect for the period during which 2 of the 4 most recent samples collected under this section remain at a level exceeding department limits. Another sample will be collected after 3 days but within 21 days. If any sample so collected exceeds the limit for that parameter while the milk producer is on warning notice, the milk producer's permit will be suspended until the problem is corrected to the satisfaction of the department, after being provided notice and an opportunity for an administrative hearing. Four samples shall then be taken at the rate of not more than 2 per week on separate days within a 3-week period, and the department shall reinstate the permit upon compliance with the appropriate standard.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   When a permit suspension has been due to a violation of the somatic cell count standard, the department may issue a temporary permit whenever a resampling of the herd's milk supply indicates the milk supply to be within acceptable limits as listed in section 70. Four samples shall then be taken at the rate of not more than 2 per week on separate days within a 3-week period, and the department shall reinstate the permit upon compliance with the appropriate standard listed in section 70.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   A dairy farm shall not ship milk for human consumption until the occurrence of each of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The dairy farm notifies the buyer and the department of its intent to become a milk shipper.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The department inspects the dairy farm and completes a written report verifying that the dairy farm is in substantial compliance with this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The department issues to the dairy farm a permit or temporary permit without charge.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   A representative of the milk buyer shall do each of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   At least once annually, inspect all farms shipping milk to that dairy plant or receiving station.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   For each inspection described in subdivision (a), complete an inspection form approved by the department that identifies all minimum requirements for milk manufacturing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Deliver a copy of the completed inspection form to the owner or operator of the inspected farm, provide a copy of the completed inspection form to the department, and file a copy of that form with the records of the dairy plant or receiving station.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   If an inspection under this subsection establishes the existence of a condition that adversely affects milk quality, conduct a subsequent inspection not later than 30 days after the original inspection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   If adverse conditions continue after an inspection described in subsection (12)(d), the representative of the milk buyer shall notify the department. The department may suspend or revoke the dairy farm's permit for failure to rectify a condition that adversely affects milk quality.</DIV>
