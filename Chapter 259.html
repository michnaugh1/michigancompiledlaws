<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) All money in and credited to the state aeronautics fund created under section 34(1) is appropriated for carrying out this act, and to meet the expenses of the department. However, money in and credited to the state aeronautics fund is not appropriated for carrying out subsection (2), except as provided in subsection (4). Upon appropriation, the state treasurer may draw a warrant on the state treasury to make payments in the amounts and to the persons as directed by the department subject to approval and release by the state administrative board of the authorized amounts. However, money appropriated under this subsection or later made available must not be expended on an aviation project not carried out under the supervision and direction of the department. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to subsection (3), all money in and credited to the qualified airport fund created under section 34(2) is appropriated for carrying out the purposes described in this subsection. On a quarterly basis, the state treasurer shall disburse from the qualified airport fund to the operator of a qualified airport an amount equal to the amount deposited into the qualified airport fund. If there is more than 1 qualified airport the state treasurer shall disburse the amount deposited into the qualified airport fund to each operator of a qualified airport in the same proportion that the amount of taxable gallons of fuel sold at the qualified airport during the preceding fiscal year bears to the total amount of taxable gallons of fuel sold at all qualified airports during the preceding fiscal year. An operator of a qualified airport shall use money disbursed to the operator under this subsection in the following order of priority:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For deposit in a bond and interest redemption account created by ordinance of the qualified airport solely to pay the next scheduled payments for revenue bonds issued by the operator of the qualified airport pursuant to an ordinance under the revenue bond act of 1933, 1933 PA 94, MCL 141.101 to 141.140, to finance capital improvements to landing areas at the qualified airport. The capital improvements to landing areas may include, but are not limited to, runway and taxiway design, construction, repair or rehabilitation, lighting, drainage systems, land acquisition, airfield roadways, noise mitigation systems, deicing pads, and surveillance systems at the qualified airport.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) To defray the costs of capital improvements to landing areas of the qualified airport. The capital improvements to landing areas may include, but are not limited to, runway and taxiway design, construction, repair or rehabilitation, lighting, drainage systems, land acquisition, airfield roadways, noise mitigation systems, deicing pads, and surveillance systems at the qualified airport.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the Federal Aviation Administration or a federal court of competent jurisdiction issues a final decision, decision and order, or order in a proceeding finding that the deposit or credit of money to the qualified airport fund under this act, section 25 of the general sales tax act, 1933 PA 167, MCL 205.75, and section 21 of the use tax act, 1937 PA 94, MCL 205.111, does not comply with, or disbursements from the qualified airport fund as authorized under subsection (2) do not comply with, the federal airport revenue use requirements under 49 USC 47107(b) or 49 USC 47133, the state treasurer shall transfer money in the qualified airport fund to the state aeronautics fund as necessary to comply with the final decision, decision and order, or order. The state treasurer shall only transfer money from the qualified airport fund under this subsection while the final decision, decision and order, or order is in effect and binding on this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The department shall, on a quarterly basis, disburse all money transferred from the qualified airport fund to the state aeronautics fund under subsection (3) to the operator of a qualified airport. The department shall not disburse money under this subsection if the disbursement would violate the terms of the final decision, decision and order, or order of the Federal Aviation Administration or federal court. If there is more than 1 qualified airport, the department shall disburse the money to each operator of a qualified airport in the same proportion that the amount of taxable gallons of fuel sold at the qualified airport during the preceding fiscal year bears to the total amount of taxable gallons of fuel sold at all qualified airports during the preceding fiscal year. An operator of a qualified airport that receives money under this subsection shall only use the money for the purposes, and in the order of priority, described in subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) By April 1, 2017, and by April 1 of each year after 2017, the operator of a qualified airport shall file a report with the department describing how the money disbursed to the operator of the qualified airport under this section was spent or otherwise used by the operator of the qualified airport during the preceding calendar year. The report must be on a form or in a format prescribed or approved by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) As used in this section, "ordinance" means that term as defined in section 3 of the revenue bond act of 1933, 1933 PA 94, MCL 141.103.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 51.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The commission has general supervision over aeronautics within this state. The commission shall encourage, foster, and participate with and provide grants to the political subdivisions of this state in the development of aeronautics within this state. The commission shall establish and encourage the establishment of airports, landing fields, and other aeronautical facilities. The commission shall promulgate rules that it considers necessary and advisable for the public safety governing the designing, laying out, location, building, equipping, and operation of airports and landing fields and shall exercise exclusive authority to approve the location and operation of airports, landing fields, and other aeronautical facilities within the state, so as to assure a uniformity in regulations covering aeronautics. In order to implement this act, the commission may establish programs of state financial assistance in the form of grants, leases, loans, and purchases, or a combination of grants, leases, loans, and purchases, for assisting political subdivisions or other persons. The commission shall not grant an exclusive right for the use of an aeronautical facility. The commission may by the issuance of appropriate and effective rules register pilot's certificates issued by the civil aeronautics authority or other similar federal authority to resident pilots of the state for which it may charge a fee not to exceed $5.00; govern and regulate commercial operations in intrastate commerce for which it may charge a fee of not more than $25.00; and provide for the licensing of aircraft dealers for which it may charge a fee of not more than $25.00.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The commission shall cooperate with and assist the federal government, state governments, authorities of political subdivisions, and individuals engaged in aeronautics or the development of aeronautics, and shall seek to coordinate the aeronautical activities of these entities. The commission may confer with or hold joint hearings with any federal or state governments, their agencies, the authorities of political subdivisions, and individuals, in connection with any matter arising under this act, and avail itself of the cooperation, services, records, and facilities of those agencies in the administration and enforcement of this act. The commission shall reciprocate by furnishing governments and their agencies its cooperation, services, records, and facilities, insofar as may be practicable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The commission may perform acts, issue and amend orders, and make, promulgate, and amend reasonable general or special rules and procedures, and establish minimum standards, consistent with this act, which it considers necessary to implement this act and to perform its duties under this act, all commensurate with and for the purpose of protecting and insuring the general public interest, health, welfare, and safety. The commission may adopt and enforce the provisions of the currently effective federal legislation governing aeronautics. The commission shall promulgate rules to implement this act. The commission may deviate from or add to rules if necessary for the public safety and for the safety of aircraft and airmen within the state. A rule of the commission shall not apply to aeronautical facilities owned by the federal government.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   For the safety of aircraft and airmen within this state the commission may designate, establish, or modify a state airways system. The commission may publish and distribute maps, charts, and information relating to that system.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The commission, a commission member or employee, the director, and every state, county, and municipal officer charged with the enforcement of state and municipal laws shall enforce and assist in the enforcement of this act and of rules promulgated under this act, and of all other laws of this state relating to aeronautics. In the aid of enforcement, general police powers are conferred upon the commission, each of its members, the director, and the officers and employees of the commission designated by the commission to exercise those powers. The commission is further authorized to enforce this act and rules promulgated under this act by injunction in the circuit court. The prosecuting attorney of the county in which an offense is committed shall prosecute offenders against this act and other aeronautical laws of this state, or any rule promulgated under this act or order issued by the commission. When a complaint is made before a municipal court in a city having such a court, or the district court in the county, district, or political subdivision in which venue is proper, that court may take cognizance, hear, try, and determine such matters and pass sentence upon offenders in accordance with law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The commission, a commission member, the director, or an employee designated by the commission may hold investigations, inquiries, and hearings concerning matters covered by this act, aircraft accidents, or orders and rules of the commission. Each person designated may administer oaths and affirmations, certify to official acts, issue subpoenas, and compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and the production of papers, books, and documents. In case of failure to comply with a subpoena or order issued under this act, the commission, or its authorized representative, may invoke the aid of a court of general jurisdiction. The court may order the witness to comply with the requirements of the subpoena or order, or to give evidence touching the matter in question. Failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as contempt.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   In order to facilitate investigations by the commission in the interest of public safety and development of aeronautics, the reports of investigations or hearings, or any part of them, shall not be admitted in evidence or used for any purpose in an action or proceeding growing out of a matter referred to in the investigation, hearing, or report, except in case of criminal or other proceedings instituted in behalf of the state under this act or any other law of this state relating to aeronautics. A commissioner, director, or an officer or employee of the commission shall not be required to testify to facts ascertained in, or information gained by reason of, his or her official capacity, or be required to testify as an expert witness in an action or proceeding involving an aircraft. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the commission may make available to appropriate federal and state agencies information and material developed in the course of its hearings and investigations.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   For the purposes of executing its powers and duties under this act, the commission, upon recommendations to the state administrative board, may enter into necessary contracts.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 110.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, an authority created under or pursuant to this section shall be a political subdivision and instrumentality of the local government that owns the airport and shall be considered a public agency of the local government for purposes of state and federal law. An authority created under or pursuant to this section also shall be the airport owner for purposes of appointing and designating an airport manager under this act. An authority shall not levy a tax or special assessment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For a local government that owns or operates a qualified airport on the effective date of this chapter, there is created an authority on the effective date of this chapter. For a local government that operates an airport that becomes a qualified airport after the effective date of this chapter, there is created an authority on the date the airport becomes a qualified airport. An authority is vested with powers granted by this chapter to manage and operate the qualified airport and airport facilities of a qualified airport and any other airport and related airport facilities owned or operated by the local government on the approval date. Before the approval date, an authority may organize and exercise all powers granted under this chapter, except those powers related to the management and operation of a qualified airport. Officials and employees of the local government and the authority shall actively cooperate with the local government, the authority, this state, and the federal government to the end that the FAA will recognize the authority as the sponsor of the qualified airport, and to obtain FAA approval of the transfers contemplated by this chapter. Any action required by this state related to the approval shall be coordinated by the department. The local government shall execute such additional documents as necessary to obtain FAA approval of the transfers contemplated by this chapter and to obtain recognition of the authority as the sponsor with respect to the qualified airport.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A local government that owns or operates an airport that is not a qualified airport may, by resolution, declare its intention to incorporate an authority. In the resolution of intent, the legislative body of the local government shall set a date for the holding of a public hearing on the adoption of a proposed resolution incorporating the authority. After a public hearing, which shall be held in accordance with the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275, if the legislative body of the local government intends to proceed with the incorporation of the authority, it shall adopt, by majority vote of its members, a resolution incorporating the authority. The adoption of the resolution is subject to any applicable statutory or charter provisions in respect to the approval or disapproval by the local chief executive officer or other officer of the local government and the adoption of an ordinance over his or her veto. The resolution shall take effect upon being filed with the secretary of state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The validity of the creation or incorporation of the authority shall be conclusively presumed unless questioned in an original action filed in the court of appeals within 60 days after the creation or incorporation of the authority under this chapter. The court of appeals has original jurisdiction to hear an action under this subsection. The court shall hear the action in an expedited manner. The state transportation department is a necessary party in any action under this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The department shall not promulgate rules under this chapter.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Notwithstanding any law or charter provision to the contrary, appointments by a local chief executive officer under subsection (2) shall not be subject to the approval by the legislative body of the local government.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 118.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The transfer of the operational jurisdiction over an airport to the authority may not in any way impair any contracts with airlines, vendors, tenants, bondholders, or other parties in privity with the local government that owns the airport over which operational jurisdiction has been transferred to an authority.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Upon the transfer of operational jurisdiction over an airport pursuant to section 117, a local government shall be relieved from all further costs and responsibility arising from or associated with control, operation, development, and maintenance of that airport, except as otherwise required under obligations retained by the local government under this chapter or as otherwise agreed by the local government.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A local government that owns an airport for which an authority has been created or incorporated under this chapter shall comply with all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Refrain from any action that would impair an authority's exercise of the powers granted to the authority under this chapter or that would impair the efficient operation and management of the airport.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 119.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   For employees who elect to transfer to the authority under subsection (2) and who are covered by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement with the local government that owns an airport over which operational jurisdiction will be transferred, the authority shall assume and be bound by those existing collective bargaining agreements for the remainder of the term of the agreement. A representative of the employees or a group of employees in the local government who represents or is entitled to represent the employees or a group of employees of the local government, pursuant to 1947 PA 336, MCL 423.201 to 423.217, shall continue to represent the employees or group of employees after the employees transfer to the authority and the authority shall honor all obligations of a public sector employer after the expiration of any collective bargaining agreement with respect to transferring employees.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Local government employees employed at an airport from which operational jurisdiction will be transferred to an authority may agree to transfer to the employment of the authority on or before a date established by the authority. The date established by the authority shall not be later than the approval date. Local government employees, who do not agree to transfer to the employment of the authority, shall be reassigned within the local government. The local government shall not, as a result of the creation or incorporation of an authority for a period of not more than 1 year, layoff or reduce the pay or benefits of any employee of the local government into whose position a local government employee who was previously employed at the airport is reassigned. The authority shall consider any person hired by the authority to fill a position that had been previously filled with a local government employee who did not agree to transfer to the employment of the authority to be under the collective bargaining agreement covering, and to be represented by the collective bargaining representative of, the local government employee who did not agree to transfer to the authority. The authority shall accept the transfers without a break in employment, subject to all rights and benefits held by the transferring employees under a collective bargaining agreement. Transferring employees shall not be placed in a worse position by reason of the transfer for a period of 1 year after the approval date, or any longer period as may be required in connection with the assumption of any applicable collective bargaining agreement, with respect to wages, workers' compensation, pension, seniority, sick leave, vacation, or health and welfare insurance or any other term and condition of employment that a transferring employee may have under a collective bargaining agreement that the employee received as an employee of the local government. The rights and benefits protected by this subsection may be altered by a future collective bargaining agreement except that any employee who as of the effective date of this chapter has the right, by contract or statute, to submit any unresolved disputes to the procedures set forth in 1969 PA 312, MCL 423.231 to 423.247, shall continue to have that right, or, for employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements, by benefit plans as established and adopted by the authority. Employees who elect to transfer shall not by reason of the transfer have their accrued local government pension benefits or credits diminished. If a transferring employee is not vested in his or her local government pension rights at the time of transfer, his or her post-transfer service with the authority shall be credited toward vesting in any local government retirement system in which the transferring employee participated prior to the transfer, but the post-transfer service with the authority shall not be credited for any other purpose under the local government's retirement system, except as provided in subsections (3) and (4). An employee who elects to transfer to the authority may, upon return to employment with the local government within 1 year from the approval date, do so without loss of seniority unless contrary to a collective bargaining agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a political appointee, other than a member of the board appointed under section 111, at an airport previously operated by the local government from which operational authority has been transferred to an authority shall not be placed in a worse position in regards to terms and conditions of employment until December 31 of the year in which the authority is created.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a local government employee described in this section elects to transfer to an authority or if a person is hired by the authority as a new employee after the date on which the authority assumes operational jurisdiction over an airport, the employee shall remain or become a participant in the local government retirement system until the authority has established its own retirement system or pension plan. During this period the employee remains or is a participant in the local government system, the employee's post-transfer service with the authority during this period and his or her post-transfer compensation from the authority during this period shall be counted in determining both eligibility for and the amount of pension benefits that the employee will be eligible to receive from the local government system or plan.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a local government employee described in this section elects to transfer to the authority, then the transferred employee may elect to remain a participant in the local government retirement system in lieu of participation in any retirement system or pension plan of the authority. By electing to remain a participant in the local government system, the employee's post-transfer service with the authority and his or her post-transfer compensation from the authority shall be counted in determining both eligibility for and the amount of pension benefits that the employee will be eligible to receive from the local government system or plan. Any election to remain in a local government system or plan shall be made within 60 days following the date the authority has established its own retirement system or pension plan and shall be irrevocable. Employees eligible to make the election described in this subsection shall be those employees who immediately before their transfer date were participating in the local government system and who agree to make any employee contributions required for continuing participation in the local government system and also agree to meet all requirements and be subject to all conditions which, from time to time, apply to employees of the local government who participate in the local government system.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   For each employee meeting the requirements of subsection (4) who elects to remain a participant in the local retirement system, the authority shall, on a timely basis, contribute the following amounts, as applicable, to the trustees of that retirement system:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   An amount determined by the local government system's actuary toward amortization of unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities which, as of the transfer date, are reasonably allocated to that employee on the local government system's records.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   An amount determined by the local government system's actuary sufficient to fund the liability for all of that employee's retirement and other benefits under the system on a current basis, as those liabilities are accrued on and after the transfer date.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   An amount determined by the local government system's actuary equal to all actuarial losses net of actuarial gains, costs, and administrative expenses of the system which are reasonably allocated to the employee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   An amount equal to the percentage of compensation that the local government would have contributed for the employee had he or she remained in the employ of the local government.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   An amount corresponding to what the local government would have contributed toward retiree health coverage for the employee. However, the authority shall succeed to all rights of the local government to modify, amend, replace, suspend, or discontinue the retiree health coverage being provided to the persons who retire from authority employment.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The authority may make application for and receive loans, grants, guarantees, or other financial assistance in aid of airport facilities and the operation of the airport from any state, federal, county, or municipal government or agency or from any other source, public or private, including financial assistance for purposes of planning, constructing, improving, and operating the airport, for providing security at the airport, and for providing ground access to the airport.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 131.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The legislative body of any political subdivision in this state may submit to the qualified electors of the political subdivision at any regular or special election called for that purpose the question of the issuance of general obligation bonds of the political subdivision, the proceeds of which shall be used for the acquisition, construction, operation, maintenance, and equipping of airports and landing fields, including buildings, structures, or facilities relating to them and the necessary land for them. A majority vote of the qualified voters voting on the question shall authorize the issuance of the general obligation bonds. General obligation bonds issued under this act are subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Revenue bonds may be issued for the purposes set forth in subsection (1), and the legislative body of the political subdivision may pledge as security for the bonds all or any portion of the landing fees, concession fees, rents, charges, or any other revenues derived from the operation of the airport. The revenue bonds shall be issued in accordance with the applicable provisions of the revenue bond act of 1933, 1933 PA 94, MCL 141.101 to 141.140. However, the fees, rents, or charges pledged that are fixed and established under the provisions of a lease or contract shall not be subject to revision or change except in the manner provided in the lease or contract. As additional security for the payment of the principal of and interest on any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this section, any issuing political subdivision may, by resolution adopted by a majority vote of its governing body, agree that if the funds pledged for the payment of the revenue bonds are not sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the bonds as they become due, the political subdivision shall advance sufficient money out of its general funds for the payment of the principal and interest, if the proceeds of the revenue bonds are used exclusively within the territorial limits of the county in which the political subdivision is located, and the treasurer of the political subdivision shall promptly make the advancement. The political subdivision shall be reimbursed for any money advanced out of funds pledged for the payment of the revenue bonds subsequently paid or collected.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except for the additional security that may be agreed upon by resolution of the governing body as provided in this section, the principal of and interest on the revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the revenues described in this section. As used in this section, "revenues" means net revenues after operating expenses.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 133.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In addition to the general powers conferred by this act, a political subdivision that has established or establishes an airport, landing field, or other aeronautical facility may do 1 or more of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Vest authority for the construction, enlargement, improvement, maintenance, equipment, operation, and regulation of the airport, landing field, or other aeronautical facility, in an officer, a board, or body of a political subdivision, by ordinance or resolution that prescribes the powers and duties of the officer, board, or body. In counties operating under the county road system with a population of more than 2,000,000, the board of county road commissioners may implement this section for that county.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Employ a regular airport manager for the airport, landing field, or other aeronautical facility under its control, or in cases where an airport board or body is established, the airport manager may be employed by the board or body.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Adopt and amend all necessary rules, regulations, and ordinances, for the management, government, and use of any properties under its control, whether within or outside of its territorial limits; appoint airport guards or police, with full police powers; establish penalties for the violation of the rules, regulations, and ordinances, and enforce the penalties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Adopt and enact rules, regulations, and ordinances designed to safeguard the public upon or beyond the limits of private airports, landing fields, or other aeronautical facilities within the political subdivision or its police jurisdiction against the perils and hazards of instrumentalities used in aerial navigation. Rules adopted pursuant to this subdivision shall be consistent with and conform as nearly as possible with the laws of this state and the rules of the state transportation department.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Lease for a term of years, donate, or sell, the airport, landing field, or other aeronautical facility, or buildings and structures relating to the airport, landing field, or other aeronautical facility, or real property acquired or set apart for these purposes, to any person or persons, any other political subdivision or the state, or the federal government, or any department of a political subdivision, or the state or federal government, either exclusively or in common with others, for operation and public use; confer the privileges of concessions of supplying upon its airports goods, commodities, things, services, and facilities; enter into leases, contracts, agreements, or grants of privileges of concessions with any person or persons, any other political subdivision or the state government or the federal government, or any department of a political subdivision or the state or federal government, for the operation, use, or occupancy, either exclusively or in common with others, of all or any part of the airport, landing field, or other aeronautical facility, including any buildings and structures of the airport, landing field, or aeronautical facility, under its control, for a term or terms not to exceed 50 years, establishing the charges, rentals, or fees at a fixed or variable rate binding upon the parties for the full term of the lease, contract, agreement, or grant, which lease, contract, agreement, or grant may provide for the resolution of disputes or for the fixing of variable terms through arbitration or similar procedure. The terms, charges, rentals, and fees shall be equal and uniform for the same type of facilities provided, services rendered, or privileges granted with no unjust discrimination between users of the same class for like facilities provided, services rendered, or privileges granted. However, the public shall not be deprived of its rightful, equal, and uniform use of facilities provided, services rendered, or privileges granted. Terms, charges, rentals, and fees may vary if necessary, to provide security and funds for payment of bonds to be issued as authorized by this act to finance improvements to any airport, or to allow for other differing costs of financing, construction of facilities, or maintenance and operation of the facility.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Sell, donate, or lease any property, real or personal, acquired for such purposes and belonging to the political subdivision, which in the judgment of its governing body, may not be subsequently required for aeronautic purposes, in accordance with the laws of this state, or the provisions of the charter of the political subdivision, governing the sale or leasing of similarly owned property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Determine the charges, rentals, or fees for the use of any properties under its control, and the charges for any services or accommodations, and the terms and conditions under which the properties may be used, which rentals, fees, charges, terms, and conditions shall be equal and uniform for the same type of use provided, services rendered, or accommodations granted with no unjust discrimination between users of the same class for like use provided, services rendered, or accommodations granted, except that any charges, rentals, and fees as may be fixed or determined by any lease, contract, agreement, or grant of privileges of concessions to which the political subdivision is a party or is the grantor, shall be binding upon all parties for the full term prescribed in the lease, contract, agreement, or grant unless the same is sooner modified or terminated by mutual consent of the parties. However, the public shall not be deprived of its rightful, equal, and uniform use of such property. Terms, charges, rentals, and fees may vary if necessary, to provide security and funds for payment of bonds to be issued as authorized by this act to finance improvements to any airport, or to allow for other differing costs of financing, construction of facilities, or maintenance and operation of any such facility. Liens may be attached and enforced by law, as provided in such cases, and their enforcement, for repairs to or improvements or storage or care of any personal property, to enforce the payment of the charges.</DIV>

The initial terms of employment, including for purposes of pension and other benefits, for transferring employees must be substantially similar to the terms of employment for the employees immediately before the transfer. The regional authority shall offer to enter into a collective bargaining agreement covering transferring employees who on their transfer date were covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the local government. The agreement offered by the regional authority must have substantially similar terms of employment as the local government collective bargaining agreement and remain in effect for the same period. The regional authority shall become the employer of transferring employees on the date of transfer without a break in employment and shall recognize the length of service of the transferring employees with the local government for purposes of the regional authority's benefit plans and programs. The local government is not an employer of any employee at the airport after the transfer date. The accrued local government pension benefits or credits of a transferring employee must not be diminished because of the transfer. Instead, the pension benefits and credits must be transferred to the retirement system or pension plan established by the regional authority as provided in subsections (2) and (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) By the approval date, the regional authority shall establish a retirement system or pension plan that initially provides benefits to each transferring employee that are substantially similar to the benefits provided by the local government's retirement system or pension plan before the approval date. The regional authority's retirement system or pension plan shall credit a transferring employee for his or her prior employment with the local government, including for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and accruals, and the employee shall make any mandatory employee contribution to the regional authority's retirement system or pension plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The local government shall, as soon as administratively feasible, but not later than 180 days after all employee transfers under subsection (1), transfer to the trustees of the regional authority retirement system or pension plan both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For defined benefit plans, all accrued benefits, all accrued liabilities, and a share of the assets of the local government's plan sufficient to fund the transferring employees' accrued benefits to the extent that the benefits have been funded by the local government on or before the transfer date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For defined contribution plans, the amount credited to each transferring employee's account in the local government's retirement system or pension plan on or before the transfer date. For purposes of this subparagraph, the local government shall fully vest the account of the transferring employee on the day immediately preceding the transfer date and shall make contributions on behalf of the transferring employee for the portion of the transfer year in which the employee was employed by the local government and eligible to participate in the plans regardless of any allocation requirements that otherwise might prevent the transferring employee from receiving a contribution for the year of the transfer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The local government shall transfer the amounts to be transferred under subsection (3) in cash or in some other form acceptable to the trustees. The transfer of money to the trustees under this subsection terminates the local government's obligation to the transferring employees and the transferring employees' rights under the local government's retirement system and pension plans.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the local government has an obligation to provide retiree health benefits or payments to transferring employees, the regional authority shall assume the obligations. The regional authority shall not assume obligations in excess of the amount properly allocable to the transferring employees. The local government shall, as soon as administratively feasible but not later than 180 days after all employee transfers under subsection (1), transfer to the regional authority an amount sufficient to fund the transferring employees' accrued benefits to the extent that the benefits have been funded by the local government on or before the transfer date. The regional authority shall transfer the amounts required to be transferred under this subsection to a qualifying entity established by the regional authority in cash, or in some other form acceptable to the qualifying entity. The transfer of money to a qualifying entity established by the regional authority under this subsection terminates the local government's obligations to the transferring employees and the transferring employees' rights to receive the benefits from the local government.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) This section only applies to local government employees who transfer their employment to the regional authority in accordance with this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An employee hired by the regional authority, other than a transferring employee, is eligible to participate in the benefit plans established by the regional authority, in accordance with and subject to the terms of the plans as established by the regional authority, in its sole discretion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Transfer date" means the earlier of the date of transfer or the deadline for transfer of employment to the regional authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Transferring employee" means an employee at the airport who timely transfers to the regional authority by the transfer date.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The amount of alcohol or the presence of a controlled substance, or both, or any drug or combination of drugs that renders a person incapable of safely operating an aircraft or acting as a crew member of an aircraft, in the operator's blood at the time alleged as shown by chemical analysis of that person's blood, urine, or breath is admissible into evidence in a criminal prosecution for a violation of section 185, 186, or of a local ordinance substantially corresponding to section 185(1), (2), or (3), or section 186.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a test is given, the results of the test shall be made available to the person charged or the person's attorney upon written request to the prosecution, with a copy of the request filed with the court. The prosecution shall furnish the report at least 2 days before the day of the trial and the results shall be offered as evidence by the prosecution in a criminal proceeding. Failure to fully comply with the request shall bar the admission of the results into evidence by the prosecution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except in a prosecution relating solely to a violation of section 185(2), it shall be presumed that the operator was under the influence of intoxicating liquor if the person's blood at the time contained 0.02 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine at the time of testing as shown by chemical analysis of that person's blood, urine, or breath.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A sample or specimen of urine or breath shall be taken and collected in a reasonable manner. Only a licensed physician, or an individual operating under the delegation of a licensed physician under section 16215 of the public health code, Act No. 368 of the Public Acts of 1978, being section 333.16215 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, and qualified to withdraw blood acting in a medical environment, at the request of a peace officer, may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the amount of alcohol or the presence of a controlled substance, or both, or the presence of any drug or combination of drugs that renders a person incapable of safely operating an aircraft or acting as a crew member of an aircraft, in the person's blood, as provided in this act. Liability for a crime or civil damages predicated on the act of withdrawing blood and related procedures shall not attach to a licensed physician or individual operating under the delegation of a licensed physician who withdraws or analyzes blood or assists in the withdrawal or analysis in accordance with this act unless the withdrawal or an analysis is performed in a negligent manner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The tests shall be administered at the request of a peace officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person has committed a crime described in subsection (1). A person who takes a chemical test administered at the request of a peace officer, as provided in this section, shall be given a reasonable opportunity to have a person of his or her own choosing administer 1 of the chemical tests described in this section within a reasonable time after his or her detention, and the results of the test shall be admissible and shall be considered with other competent evidence in determining the innocence or guilt of the defendant. If the person charged is administered a chemical test by a person of his or her own choosing, the person charged shall be responsible for obtaining a chemical analysis of the test sample. The person charged shall be informed that he or she has the right to demand that a person of his or her own choosing administer 1 of the tests provided for in subsection (1), that the results of the test shall be admissible and shall be considered with other competent evidence in determining the innocence or guilt of the defendant, and that the person charged shall be responsible for obtaining a chemical analysis of the test sample.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That if the person refuses the lawful request of a peace officer to take a test described in this section, a test shall not be given without a court order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   That a written report will be forwarded by the peace officer to the federal aviation district office having jurisdiction over the county in which the person refused to submit to the test.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   This section shall not be construed as limiting the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether or not the person was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or any drug or combination of drugs that renders a person incapable of safely operating an aircraft or acting as a crew member of an aircraft, or a combination of intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance or any drug or combination of drugs that renders a person incapable of safely operating an aircraft or acting as a crew member of an aircraft, or whether the person had an alcohol content of 0.02 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine, or whether the person acted or attempted to act as a crew member of an aircraft or operated an aircraft within 8 hours after the consumption of an intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance or any drug or combination of drugs that renders a person incapable of safely operating an aircraft or acting as a crew member of an aircraft.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If after an accident the operator of an aircraft or a crew member of an aircraft involved in the accident is transported to a medical facility and a sample of the person's blood is withdrawn at that time for the purpose of medical treatment, the result of a chemical analysis of that sample shall be admissible in a criminal prosecution for a crime described in subsection (1) to show the amount of alcohol or the presence of a controlled substance, or both, or the presence of any drug or combination of drugs that renders a person incapable of safely operating an aircraft or acting as a crew member of an aircraft, in the person's blood at the time alleged, regardless of whether the person had been offered or had refused a chemical test. The medical facility or person performing the chemical analysis shall disclose the results of the analysis to a prosecuting attorney who requests the results for use in a criminal prosecution as provided in this subsection. A medical facility or person disclosing information in compliance with this subsection shall not be civilly or criminally liable for making the disclosure.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   If after an accident the operator of an aircraft or a crew member of an aircraft involved in the accident is deceased, a sample of the decedent's blood shall be withdrawn in a manner directed by the medical examiner for the purpose of determining blood alcohol content or presence of a controlled substance, or both, or the presence of any drug or combination of drugs that renders a person incapable of safely operating an aircraft or acting as a crew member of an aircraft.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   It is hereby found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of the general public, of users of the airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity, and also, if of the obstruction type, in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing, taking-off, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the airport and the public investment therein. Accordingly, it is hereby declared: (a) That the creation or establishment or maintenance of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the community served by the airport in question; and (b) that it is therefore necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety, and general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport hazards be prevented. It is further declared that both the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, abatement, or marking or lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or property rights therein.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The commission shall formulate, adopt and revise, when necessary, an airport approach plan for each publicly owned airport in this state. Each such plan shall indicate and determine the circumstances in which structures and trees are or would be airport hazards, the airport hazard area within which measures for the protection of the airport's aerial approaches should be taken, and what the height limits and other objectives of such measures should be. In adopting or revising any such plans, the commission shall consider, among other things, the character of the flying operations expected to be conducted at the airport, the traffic pattern and regulations affecting flying operations at the airport, the nature of the terrain, the height of existing structures and trees above the level of the airport, and the possibility of lowering or removing existing obstructions; and the commission may obtain and consider the views of the agency of the federal government charged with the fostering of civil aeronautics, as to the aerial approaches necessary to safe flying operations at the airport.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In order to prevent the creation or establishment of airport hazards, every political subdivision having an airport hazard area wholly or partly within its territorial limits or jurisdiction may make an official determination that the area is in fact an airport hazard area and may thereupon adopt, administer, and enforce, in the interest of public safety and in the manner and upon the conditions prescribed in this act, airport zoning regulations for that part of the airport hazard area which is within its territorial limits or jurisdiction. The regulations may divide the area into zones, and, within those zones, may specify the land uses permitted and regulate and restrict the height to which structures and trees may be erected or allowed to grow.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A political subdivision in which is wholly or partially located an airport hazard area, may adopt, administer, and enforce zoning regulations for that part of an airport hazard area within the political subdivision's territorial limits or jurisdiction to protect public health and safety. The political subdivision may divide the area into zones and specify within the zones the land uses or developments permitted. As used in this subsection, "development" means an activity which materially alters or affects the existing conditions or use on any land.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In each case where an airport hazard area exists in connection with a publicly owned airport and suitable airport zoning regulations have not been adopted, administered and enforced for such airport hazard area in a form and manner deemed reasonably adequate by the commission for the purposes of this act, the commission on behalf of this state shall define and determine such airport hazard area and certify such determination to the board of supervisors of the county or counties within which such airport hazard area is located and to the political subdivision authorized by law to maintain, operate, improve and regulate such airport, hereinafter referred to in this section as the airport operating agency. Whereupon and within 90 days thereafter, the board of supervisors of each county involved shall appoint 3 members and the operating agency and the commission shall each appoint 1 member to a board which shall constitute a joint airport zoning board. Two of the members appointed by the board of supervisors of each county involved shall be from a township or townships within which the hazard area is located and 1 shall be from that part of the county outside the townships where the hazard area is located. Within 120 days after such certification such airport zoning board shall meet and organize and thereafter function in the same manner and with the same powers as joint airport zoning boards provided for under section 14 of this act. Members of joint zoning boards created pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be compensated for services actually rendered at a rate established by the airport operating agency and approved by the commission, and shall be reimbursed for any actual and necessary expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Subject to the approval of the airport operating agency, each joint board created pursuant to the provisions of this section is hereby authorized to make such expenditures, to employ such servants and to engage such professional and consultant services as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this act. All expenses of such joint boards, including the compensation of its members, shall be paid by the airport operating agency. Provided, however, That the commission and the board of supervisors of any county involved, or any of them, are hereby authorized to participate in and contribute toward such compensation and expenses in such amounts and to such extent as may be fixed or provided by agreement.</DIV>

No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a non-conforming structure or tree or non-conforming use to be made or become higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was when the applicable regulation was adopted or than it is when the application for permit is made. Whenever an administrative agency determines that a non-conforming use or non-conforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than 80 per cent torn down, destroyed, deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.</DIV>

The board of appeals shall allow a variance if a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest, but would do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of the regulations. However, a variance may be granted subject to any reasonable condition or condition subsequent that the board of appeals considers necessary to effectuate the purposes of this act.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Not later than April 1 of each year the airport authority board shall prepare a budget containing an itemized statement of the estimated current expenses and the expenses for capital outlay, including the amount necessary to pay the principal and interest of any outstanding bonds or other obligations of the authority maturing during the ensuing fiscal year or which have previously matured and are unpaid, and an estimate of the estimated revenue of the airport authority from all sources for the ensuing fiscal year. Airport authorities consisting only of 2 or more counties shall have until September 1 of each year to prepare this budget. The board shall adopt such budget as shall be deemed necessary and shall ascertain what appropriations are required from the several counties, cities, townships, and villages to meet their respective shares of the amount of the budget in excess of the estimated revenues.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In determining the fair and equitable share of each county, city, and township, the board shall establish the ratio that the state equalized valuation of each for the year in which the appropriation is required bears to the total state equalized valuation for the year in which the appropriation is required of all the counties, cities, and townships included in the airport authority and use the applicable ratio in determining the amount of appropriation required from a county, city, or township. Any village included in the airport authority shall appropriate its proportionate share of the amount apportioned to the township in which it is located, and in determining the division between the township and village, the amount of their respective state equalized valuations for the year the appropriation is required shall be used as the basis for the determination. The board shall certify to each participating county, city, township, and village the amount to be raised by them, and the respective counties, cities, townships, and villages shall include such amounts in their next ensuing budgets and shall pay the amounts so certified from any funds they have available or from the proceeds of a tax which they are authorized to levy, in an amount sufficient therefor, but not exceeding 1 mill. Payment of sums so certified shall be due and payable to the airport authority 120 days subsequent to the date upon which local taxes become due and payable in counties, cities, villages, and townships participating in the airport authority. Each county, city, township, and village shall be liable for the amount so certified.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The board shall also render to each participating county, city, township, and village, on each July 1, during the operation of the airport a certified report of the operation of the airport. Each report shall state the condition of the finances, the amount of money expended, and the money received from all sources. The board shall also file a copy of the report with the department of treasury together with any other information the department of treasury may require. Within 30 days after the formation of any new airport authority, and annually on July 1 thereafter, the airport authority board shall file with the secretary of state a report as the secretary of state may require, showing the date of formation, the names of the member communities, and any other information as the report may call for.</DIV>

If no election or nomination to any state, county, district, or other local office is on the ballot in a given political subdivision within the county on the day of the election regarding the airport authority proposition, and if in that subdivision there is no ballot proposition, proposal, or question submitted by that subdivision, the authority shall pay all, or if the authority proposition is not the only proposition, proposal, or question before the electorate, a pro rata portion of the reasonable costs of the election incurred by that political subdivision as determined by the county clerk.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The tax authorized by this section shall be levied and collected as are all ad valorem property taxes in the state, and the secretary of the board of the authority shall at the appropriate times certify to the proper tax assessing or collecting officers of each city and township in the county the amount of taxes to be levied and collected each year for the authority by each city and township. The board of the authority shall determine on which tax roll of the city or township, if there is more than 1 roll, that the tax authorized by this section shall be collected. However, the tax shall not be levied on a July tax roll unless certified by the authority not later than the immediately preceding June 15, and shall not be levied on a December tax roll unless certified not later than the immediately preceding October 1, except that a tax authorized by this section and approved at an election held on November 3, 1987, may be levied on a December 1987 tax roll. Each tax assessing and collecting officer shall levy and collect the taxes certified by the authority and pay those taxes to the county treasurer in accordance with the same schedule as is applicable pursuant to section 43 of the general property tax act, Act No. 206 of the Public Acts of 1893, being section 211.43 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, with respect to the delivery of county taxes. The county treasurer shall account for and deliver to the authority the tax collections for authority purposes, received by the county treasurer from local collecting officers, within 10 business days after the county treasurer receives the funds. If a tax is certified for levy on a December 1987 tax roll, the reasonable and actual expenses incurred by a township, county, or city in assessing and collecting the tax on that roll, to the extent these expenses are in addition to the expense of collection and assessing any other taxes at the same time and exceed the amount of any fees imposed for the collection of the tax, shall be billed to and paid by the authority.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The budget of the authority, other than the first budget, shall be adopted before commencement of the fiscal year to which the budget relates.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The resolution creating the airport authority may establish or may have established conditions under which the authority shall be dissolved.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 8.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   For the purpose of acquiring, purchasing, constructing, improving, enlarging, or repairing such community airports, the airport authority board may issue self-liquidating bonds of the authority in accordance with Act No. 94 of the Public Acts of 1933, as amended, being sections 141.101 to 141.139 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. The bonds shall not impose any liability upon the counties, cities, villages, and townships included in the airport authority, other than on the amounts which are assessed against the respective municipalities as provided for by this act, which amounts or any portion thereof may be pledged by the governing body of the airport authority for the payment of the bonds for a period not exceeding 40 years. The amount herein required to be paid by any municipality under the provisions of this act shall be considered to be a part of the revenues of the airport authority as that term is defined in section 3(f) of Act No. 94 of the Public Acts of 1933, as amended, being section 141.103 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. The bonds shall be sold for not less than par and shall bear interest at a rate not in excess of the maximum rate permitted under section 12 of Act No. 94 of the Public Acts of 1933, as amended, being section 141.112 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. If a petition for referendum is filed with the secretary of the airport authority in accordance with the provisions of section 33 of Act No. 94 of the Public Acts of 1933, as amended, being section 141.133 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, the governing body of the airport authority shall adopt a resolution establishing the date of the election, which shall be not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days after the adoption of the resolution. The secretary of the authority, within 5 days after the adoption of the resolution, shall transmit a certified copy of the resolution to the governing body of each member community. The governing bodies of the member communities immediately shall provide for an election in accordance with the resolution passed by the authority, in which the question of issuing the bonds and pledging the authority's revenues, including all or any part of the amounts assessed against the respective municipalities as provided for by this act, shall be submitted. The ballots for use in the election shall be provided by the authority and the election shall be conducted in the respective communities except that if any part or all of a village belonging to an airport authority is located in a township belonging to the same authority, the township election shall include that part of the village located in it and the village shall not be required to hold an election except in that portion of the village not located in a township belonging to the authority. The governing bodies of the member communities shall act as a board of canvassers and shall certify the results of the election to the airport authority board, within 5 days after the date of the election, on forms provided by the airport authority. The airport authority board shall compile and tabulate the vote as required from the member communities and certify the result of the election by resolution upon the records of the authority. A majority of the total valid votes cast at such an election voting "yes" on the question submitted shall constitute an approval of the issuance of the bonds.</DIV>
