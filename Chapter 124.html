<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, any 2 or more municipal corporations, by intergovernmental contract, may form a group self-insurance pool to provide for joint or cooperative action relative to their financial and administrative resources for the purpose of providing to the participating municipal corporations risk management and coverage for pool members and employees of pool members, for acts or omissions arising out of the scope of their employment, including any or all of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A group self-insurance pool may not provide for hospital, medical, surgical, or dental benefits to the employees of the member municipalities in the pool except as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the municipal corporation is providing hospital, medical, surgical, or dental benefits as permitted under the public employees health benefit act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the municipal corporation has formed a multiple employer welfare arrangement under chapter 70 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.7001 to 500.7090, for hospital, medical, surgical, or dental benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the hospital, medical, surgical, or dental benefits arise from the obligations and responsibilities of the pool in providing automobile insurance coverage, including motor vehicle liability insurance coverage and security for motor vehicles owned or operated, as required by section 3101 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.3101, and protection against other liability and loss associated with the ownership of motor vehicles. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A group self-insurance pool may assume, cede, and sell risk for coverages set forth in subsection (1). If a group self-insurance pool obtains reinsurance, the reinsurance contract shall be made available to the commissioner upon request. If the reinsurance contract is not available to the group self-insurance pool, the group self-insurance pool shall provide the commissioner with written documentation of coverage as is requested by the commissioner.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The legislature hereby finds and determines that insurance protection is essential to the proper functioning of municipal corporations; that the resources of municipal corporations are burdened by the securing of insurance protection through standards carriers; that proper risk management requires spreading risk to minimize fluctuation in insurance needs; and that, therefore, all contributions of financial and administrative resources made by a municipal corporation pursuant to an intergovernmental contract authorized under this act are made for a public and governmental purpose, and that those contributions benefit each contributing municipal corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Two or more municipal corporations shall not form a group self-insurance pool to provide the coverages described in subsection (1) other than pursuant to sections 5 to 12b.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>124.79 Public employer pooled plan; requirements; effect of insufficient reserves; authority of commissioner to take certain actions.</B><P>Sec. 9.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) In addition to other requirements as provided in this act, a public employer pooled plan established on or after October 1, 2007 shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Establish and maintain minimum cash reserves of not less than 25% of the aggregate contributions in the current fiscal year or in the case of new applicants, 25% of the aggregate contributions projected to be collected during its first 12 months of operation, as applicable; or not less than 35% of the claims paid in the preceding fiscal year, whichever is greater. As an alternative, a pooled plan that has operated for 5 years or more may elect to maintain minimum cash reserves in an amount equal to 2.5% of the immediately preceding year's claims plus its most recent designated reserve for incurred but not reported claims, as indicated in its financial statement filed with the commissioner under subdivision (b). Reserves established pursuant to this section must be maintained in a separate, identifiable account and must not be commingled with other funds of the pooled plan. The pooled plan shall invest the required reserve in the types of investments allowed under section 910, 912, or 914 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.910, 500.912, and 500.914. Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the pooled plan may satisfy up to 100% of the reserve requirement in the first year of operation, up to 75% of the reserve requirement in the second year of operation, and up to 50% of the reserve requirement in the third and subsequent years of operation, through an irrevocable and unconditional letter of credit. A pooled plan that elects the alternative minimum cash reserve may not satisfy any portion of the reserve requirement with a letter of credit. As used in this subdivision, "letter of credit" means a letter of credit that meets all of the following requirements:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Is issued by a federally insured financial institution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Is issued upon such terms and in a form as approved by the commissioner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Is subject to draw by the commissioner, upon giving 5 business days' written notice to the pooled plan, or by the pooled plan for the member's benefit if the pooled plan is unable to pay claims as they come due.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, file with the commissioner financial statements audited by a certified public accountant. An actuarial opinion regarding reserves for known claims and associated expenses and incurred but not reported claims and associated expenses, in accordance with subdivision (d), must be included in the audited financial statement. The opinion must be rendered by an actuary approved by the commissioner or who has 5 or more years of experience in this field.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Within 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter, file with the commissioner unaudited financial statements, affirmed by an appropriate officer or agent of the pooled plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Within 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter, file with the commissioner a report certifying that the pooled plan maintains reserves that are sufficient to meet its contractual obligations, and that it maintains coverage for excess loss as required in this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) File with the commissioner a schedule of premium contributions, rates, and renewal projections.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Possess a written commitment, binder, or policy for excess loss insurance issued by an insurer authorized to do business in this state in an amount approved by the commissioner. The binder or policy must provide not less than 30 days' notice of cancellation to the commissioner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Establish a procedure, to the satisfaction of the commissioner, for handling claims for benefits in the event of dissolution of the pooled plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Provide for administration of the plan using personnel of the pooled plan, provided that the pooled plan has within its own organization adequate facilities and competent personnel to service the medical benefit plan, or by awarding a competitively bid contract, to an authorized third party administrator, an insurer, a nonprofit health care corporation, or other entity authorized to provide services in connection with a noninsured medical benefit plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the commissioner finds that a pooled plan's reserves are not sufficient to meet the requirements of subsection (1)(a), the commissioner shall order the pooled plan to immediately collect from any public employer that is or has been a member of the pooled plan appropriately proportionate contributions sufficient to restore reserves to the required level. The commissioner may take such action as he or she considers necessary, including, but not limited to, ordering the suspension or dissolution of a pooled plan, if the pooled plan is consistently failing to maintain reserves as required in this section; is using methods and practices that render further transaction of business hazardous or injurious to its members, employees, beneficiaries, or to the public; has failed, after written request by the commissioner, to remove or discharge an officer, director, trustee, or employee who has been convicted of any crime involving fraud, dishonesty, or moral turpitude; has failed or refused to furnish any report or statement required under this act; or if the commissioner, upon investigation, determines that it is conducting business fraudulently or is not meeting its contractual obligations in good faith. Any proceedings by the commissioner under this subsection are governed by the requirements and procedures of sections 7074 to 7078 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.7074 to 500.7078.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The authority and any of its constituent municipalities or an Indian tribe may enter into a contract or contracts providing for the acquisition, construction, improvement, enlargement, extension, operation, and financing of a sewage disposal system, a water supply system, a solid waste management system, or a combination of systems. The contract or contracts shall provide for the allocation and payment of the share of the total cost to be borne by each contracting municipality or Indian tribe in annual installments for a period of not exceeding 40 years. Each contracting municipality may pledge its full faith and credit for the payment of the obligation in the manner and times specified in the contract or contracts. If a contracting municipality makes such a pledge, it may include in its annual tax levy an amount sufficient so that the estimated collections from the tax levy will be sufficient to promptly pay when due the portion of the obligation falling due before the time of the following year's tax collection. The contract is not subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821. If the contract or an unlimited tax pledge in support of the contract has been approved by the electors of a municipality, the tax may be in addition to any tax that the municipality may otherwise be authorized to levy and may be imposed without limitation as to rate or amount but shall not be in excess of the rate or amount necessary to pay the contractual obligation. If at the time of making the annual tax levy there are other funds on hand earmarked for the payment of the contractual obligation, credit for those funds may be taken upon the annual levy for the payment of the obligation. Other funds may be raised by each contracting municipality by the use of 1 or more of the following additional methods:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The levy of special assessments on property benefited by a sewage disposal system, water supply system, or a combination of systems. The procedures relative to the levying and collection of the special assessments shall conform as nearly as is applicable to charter or statutory provisions for the levying and collection, except that a petition is not required from property owners.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The levy and collection of charges to users and beneficiaries of the service or services furnished by the sewage disposal system, water supply system, solid waste management system, or combination of systems.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The exaction of connection charges to be paid by owners of land directly or indirectly connected with the sewage disposal system, water supply system, solid waste management system, or combination of systems.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The receipt of money derived from the imposition of taxes by this state, except to the extent that the use of the money for this purpose is expressly prohibited by the state constitution of 1963.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The receipt of other funds that may be validly used for this purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The contract or contracts under subsection (1) may provide for any matters relating to the acquisition, construction, operation, and financing of the sewage disposal system, water supply system, solid waste management system, or combination of systems as are considered necessary, including authorization to the authority to issue bonds secured by the full faith and credit pledges of the contracting municipalities, as authorized by section 9. The contract or contracts may provide for an appropriate remedy or remedies in case of default.</div>

If, before November 19, 1981, a municipality published a resolution authorizing the execution of a contract under this section in substantial compliance with this section as then in effect, and the referendum period formerly provided by this section expired, but the bonds were not issued, the resolution and the publication of the resolution are valid and, if a petition for a referendum on execution of the contract was not signed and filed within the time period formerly provided by this section, the contract may be executed and shall become effective without submitting the proposition for approval to the electors, or if a petition was so signed and filed, the contract may be executed and become effective if approved at an election as formerly provided in this section. A special election called for the purpose provided in this section shall not be included in any statutory or charter limitation as to the number of special elections to be called within any period of time. Signatures on the petition shall be verified under oath as the actual signatures of the persons whose names are signed to the petition. The clerk of the municipality has the same power to reject signatures as city clerks under section 25 of the home rule city act, 1909 PA 279, MCL 117.25.

</P>
<P>Sec. 12b.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    As an additional or alternative method of financing a water supply system or sewage disposal system, hereinafter generally referred to in this section and section 12c as the "project", any authority proposing a project to cost a sum of $50,000,000.00 or more for such purposes, is authorized to proceed under the provisions of this section and section 12c. In such event the authority is hereby authorized by resolution or resolutions of its governing body to provide for the issuance of revenue bonds for the purpose of paying all or any portion of the cost of the project, or for the purpose of refunding the bonds, including refunding bonds, or for any combination of such purposes. The term "cost of the project" includes all expenditures made in connection with the acquisition and construction thereof, financing charges, interest to accrue on the bonds during the period of construction of the project and for a period of not to exceed 1 year thereafter, cost of engineering and legal expenses, plans, specifications and surveys, other expenses necessary or incident to determining the feasibility or practicability of constructing the project, administrative expense, and such other expense as may be necessary or incident to the construction of the project, the financing of the project and the placing of the project in operation, including the repayment of any moneys advanced by constituent municipalities of the authority for any of the above purposes. The authority may enter into such contracts for financial, fiscal agents, legal or engineering services in connection with the financing and construction of the project as it deems necessary and advisable. The authority shall not contract for the payment of stand-by bids or finders' fees.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Principal of and interest and redemption premiums on the bonds issued under this section shall be payable solely from the revenues of the project, except that payments may also be made from the proceeds of refunding bonds issued under this section. The term "revenues of the project" as used in this section and section 12c means revenues derived from contracts with municipalities entered into pursuant to the provisions of section 10 of this act, and all other sources of revenue of the authority derived from the operation of the project. The bonds may be either serial bonds or term bonds, or any combination thereof. Any serial bonds shall have annual or semiannual maturities, the first maturity of which shall be payable not more than 10 years from their date. Any bonds shall be redeemable commencing with an interest payment date to be determined at such prices and upon such terms and conditions as prescribed by the authorizing resolution of the governing body of the authority, and recited upon the face of the bonds. The bonds shall mature not more than 40 years from their date, shall be coupon bonds bearing interest at not more than 6% per annum, payable semiannually, except as to the first coupon, which may be for any number of months not exceeding 10, shall be payable in such medium, shall be in such form and executed in such manner, shall have such privilege of registration as to principal or principal and interest, shall be payable at such places within or without the state, and shall otherwise have such other details as may be fixed by resolution of the governing body of the authority. The resolution of the governing body of the authority may provide the terms and conditions under which additional revenue bonds may be issued, having parity of lien with those issued and outstanding for the purpose of completing the project or providing for additions, extensions and improvements thereto. All bonds issued under the provisions of this section shall contain a statement on their face that they are payable solely and only from the revenues of the authority specifically pledged for their payment, and that the authority is authorized to pay such bonds and interest only from the revenues pledged thereto under the provisions of this section. If any official whose signature appears on the bonds or coupons ceases to be such officer before delivery of the bonds, the signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes with like effect as though the person had remained in office until delivery. All such bonds are hereby declared to be fully negotiable and to have all of the qualities incident to negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the state, subject only to the provisions for registration of the bonds which may appear therein. The bonds shall be exempt from all taxation by the state or any of its political subdivisions, and may be sold by the governing body of the authority in such manner as it, in its sole discretion, determines to be in the best interest of the authority, but no sale shall be made at a price that will result in an interest cost of more than 6% per annum. The issuance and sale of bonds shall not be subject to the approval or authorization of any other agency of government, whether federal, state or local, but shall be entirely within the discretion and judgment of the governing body of the authority. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the governing body of the authority may provide for the issuance of temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. The proceedings authorizing the bonds may provide that the bonds shall contain a recital that they are issued pursuant to this act, and such recital shall be conclusive evidence of their validity and the regularity of their issuance.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 12c.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In the discretion of the governing body of the authority, any series of bonds issued pursuant to the authorization of section 12b may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state, but no trust indenture shall convey or mortgage the project or any part of the project. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of bonds or the trust indenture may contain the provisions for the security and payment of the bonds and for the protection and enforcement of the rights and remedies of the bondholders as deemed advisable by the governing body of the authority, not in violation of the constitution of this state, including specifically covenants setting forth the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The duties of the authority in relationship to the construction, maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Rights and remedies of the bondholders and the trustee, if any, and the restrictions thereon as may be considered advisable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Any other and additional provisions ordinarily found in trust agreements securing bond issues protecting and enforcing the rights and security of the holders of the bonds and designed to make the bonds more attractive and salable at the best available prices.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The resolution or trust indenture shall contain a provision requiring an annual audit of the books and records of the authority, or any fiscal agent or trustee specified in the resolution or trust indenture by a certified public accountant or accountants to be selected by the governing body of the authority and approved by the manager or managers of the account purchasing the bonds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Any bank or trust company designated as trustee or as depositary for any funds, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, is authorized to pledge as collateral security for moneys deposited in such bank or trust company direct obligations of, or obligations the principal and interest of which are unconditionally guaranteed by the government of the United States, or other marketable securities eligible as security for the deposit of trust funds under regulations of the federal reserve board and having a market value, exclusive of accrued interest, at least equal to the amount of the deposit; or in lieu of the collateral security as to all or any part of the deposit, there may be lodged with the trustee, or with the governing body of the authority in case of moneys deposited or remaining on deposit with the trustee, and remain in full force and effect as security for the moneys deposited, the indemnifying bonds of a surety company or companies qualified as surety for deposits of the government of the United States and qualified to transact business in this state, in a sum at least equal to the amount of moneys deposited with such bank or trust company, if such indemnity bond or bonds be approved by the governing body of the authority. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions appearing in any trust indenture or bond resolution and the cost of any surety bond furnished may be treated as part of the cost of maintaining and operating the project. The resolution or trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the governing body of the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders, including, but without limitation, covenants prescribing all happenings or occurrences that constitute events of default and the terms and conditions upon which bonds may become or be declared to be due before maturity and as to the rights, liabilities, powers, and duties arising upon the breach by the authority of any of its duties and obligations.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Nothing contained in the 1958 amendments to this act shall be construed to authorize the issuance of other than revenue bonds.</DIV>

Where the authority has acquired, constructed or initiated a system which includes routes or service which originates in, terminates in or passes through areas not included in the authority then those routes, service and maintenance of service as well as the rates therefor shall be under the jurisdiction of the public service commission in the same manner and to the same degree as any other common motor carrier of passengers for hire operating outside the authority area. If the counties in which these areas are situate become part of the authority the jurisdiction of the public service commission as to the routes, service maintenance of service and rates of the authority in that county shall terminate. Any person aggrieved by any rate or service or change of service fixed by the authority may bring an appeal against the authority in the proper court in any county in the metropolitan area in which the charge, service or change of service is applicable, for the purpose of protesting against any such charge, service or change of service. The grounds for such appeals shall be restricted to an abuse of discretion or an error of law; otherwise, all such actions by the authority are final. Whenever 2 or more appeals are brought against the same action of the authority, exclusive jurisdiction for the determination thereof shall be vested in the first court to receive an appeal, and all other courts receiving subsequent appeals against the same action shall transfer the appeals to the first court. Upon the finding of an error of law or a manifest and flagrant abuse of discretion, the court shall issue an order setting forth the abuse or error and returning the matter to the authority for such further action as is not inconsistent with the findings of the court. No cause of action shall exist on behalf of any person directly or indirectly, under which any court shall have jurisdiction or power to issue or grant any temporary or preliminary injunction or restraining order to prevent or suspend the operation of any order or rule of the authority which fixes rates, fares, tolls, rents or other charges for the use of or which changes any services of the transportation facilities under the jurisdiction of the authority.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A public authority formed under this act may levy a tax on all of the taxable property within the limits of the public authority for public transportation purposes as authorized by this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The tax authorized in subsection (1) shall not exceed 5 mills of the state equalized valuation on each dollar of assessed valuation of taxable property within the limits of the applicable public authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The tax authorized under subsection (1) shall not be levied except upon the approval of a majority of the registered electors residing in the public authority affected and qualified to vote and voting on the tax at a general or special election. The election may be called by resolution of the board of the public authority.

If the county treasurer and the public authority fail to reach an agreement for the collection by the county of the July property tax levy of the public authority, the July property tax levy shall be collected with the December property tax levy. Any agreement negotiated under this subsection shall guarantee the collecting unit its reasonable expenses. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a city or township which is levying a July property tax.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If, pursuant to subsection (6), the public authority has reached a proposed agreement with a county treasurer on the collection of its July property tax levy against property located in a city or township with which an agreement to collect this levy could not be made pursuant to subsection (6), the public authority shall notify by April 15 that city or township of the terms of that fact and the city or township shall have 15 days in which to exercise an option to collect the public authority's July property tax levy.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Interest shall be added to taxes collected after September 14 at that rate imposed by section 59 of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.59, on delinquent property tax levies which became a lien in the same year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) All or a portion of fees or charges, or both, authorized under section 44 of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.44, may be imposed on taxes paid before March 1 and shall be retained by the treasurer actually performing the collection of the July property tax levy of the public authority, regardless of whether all or part of these fees or charges, or both, have been waived by the township or city.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An agreement for the collection of a July property tax levy of a public authority with a county treasurer shall include a schedule for delivering collections to the public authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) To the extent applicable and consistent with the requirements of this section, the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157, shall apply to proceedings in relation to the assessment, spreading, and collection of taxes pursuant to this section. Additionally, in relation to the assessment, spreading, and collection of taxes pursuant to this section, the county treasurer shall have powers and duties similar to those prescribed by the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157, for township supervisors, township clerks, and township treasurers. However, this section shall not be considered to transfer any authority over the assessment of property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If a county treasurer collects the July property tax levy of the public authority, the township or city shall deliver by June 1 a certified copy of the assessment roll containing state equalized valuations for each parcel of taxable property in the township or city to the treasurer collecting the July property tax levy of the public authority. The county treasurer receiving this certified copy of the assessment roll shall remit the necessary cost incident to the reproduction of the assessment roll to the township or city.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A county treasurer collecting taxes pursuant to this section shall be bonded for tax collection in the same amount and in the same manner as a township treasurer would be for undertaking the duties prescribed by this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) An agreement for the collection of a July property tax levy between a public authority and a county may cover July collections for 2 years. If an agreement covers July collections for 2 years, the notice required by subsection (7) and the option to reconsider provided by subsection (7) shall not apply for July collections in the second year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) If collections are made pursuant to this section by a county treasurer, all payments from a public authority for collecting its July property tax levy and all revenues generated from collection fees shall be deposited, when received or collected, in a fund, which fund shall be used by the county treasurer to pay for the cost of collecting the public authority's July property tax levy.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) This section does not limit the rights of employees, under applicable law, to assert that a bargaining representative protected by subsection (7) is no longer their representative. The employees of the joint exercise of power are eligible as of the day the joint exercise of power becomes effective through its contract to choose their representative under 1947 PA 336, MCL 423.201 to 423.217. This subsection does not extend the time limits as provided in subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If multiple labor organizations assert the right to represent all or part of the workforce of the joint exercise of power or where a substantial portion of the transferred employees were not previously represented, in the absence of a voluntary mutual agreement, at the request of any party or on the initiative of the Michigan employment relations commission, the Michigan employment relations commission shall conduct a representation election.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) In the absence of a voluntary mutual agreement, the workforce of the joint exercise of power shall be merged by using a single seniority list for each of the same or similar classifications.

Disputes concerning the single seniority list or use of the single seniority list shall be heard by a single arbitrator appointed by the Michigan employment relations commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Nothing in this section requires a public agency or a joint exercise of power to assume a collective bargaining agreement between another public agency and its employees.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The contents or language of a contract for a transfer of functions or responsibilities under this act shall be a permissive subject of collective bargaining between a political subdivision and a bargaining representative of its employees. If a political subdivision and a bargaining representative of its employees engage in collective bargaining before the contract for a transfer of functions or responsibilities is approved and that political subdivision and that bargaining representative reach an agreement on issues that would obligate the political subdivision that will function as an employer in the joint system, the contract for that transfer of functions or responsibilities shall include those obligations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Nothing in this act creates an employment relationship between the existing employees of a political subdivision and the proposed joint system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A joint system is effective through its contract at least 180 days before the actual transfer of functions or responsibilities.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) This section does not limit the rights of employees, under applicable law, to assert that a bargaining representative protected by subsection (7) is no longer their representative. The employees of the joint system are eligible as of the day the joint system becomes effective through its contract to choose their representative under 1947 PA 336, MCL 423.201 to 423.217. This subsection does not extend the time limits as provided in subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If multiple labor organizations assert the right to represent all or part of the joint system's workforce or where a substantial portion of the transferred employees were not previously represented, in the absence of a voluntary mutual agreement, at the request of any party or on the initiative of the Michigan employment relations commission, the Michigan employment relations commission shall conduct a representation election.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) In the absence of a voluntary mutual agreement, the joint system's workforce shall be merged by using a single seniority list for each of the same or similar classifications. The single seniority list shall be composed of all employees from each political subdivision employed or having recall rights on the date of transfer and shall be used for purposes that include, but are not limited to, initial assignments, layoffs, recalls, and job bidding. Disputes concerning the single seniority list or use of the single seniority list shall be heard by a single arbitrator appointed by the Michigan employment relations commission.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The municipalities that are parties to an authority entered into pursuant to this act have the responsibility, authority, and right to manage and direct on behalf of the public the emergency services performed or exercised to the extent provided in the articles of incorporation creating the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The contents or language of the articles of incorporation under this act shall be a permissive subject of collective bargaining between a municipality and a bargaining representative of its employees. If a municipality and a bargaining representative of its employees engage in collective bargaining before the articles of incorporation are approved and that municipality and that bargaining representative reach an agreement on issues that would obligate an entity that will function as an employer in the authority, the articles of incorporation shall include those obligations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Nothing in this act creates an employment relationship between the existing employees of a municipality and the proposed authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An authority is effective through its articles of incorporation at least 180 days before the actual transfer of personnel and equipment. Before the authority's effective date, the incorporating municipalities shall affirm in writing to the authority those employees who will be transferred to the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If employees who are transferred to the authority are represented by a labor organization, those employees are subject to their previous terms and conditions of employment until those terms and conditions of employment are modified in accordance with 1947 PA 336, MCL 423.201 to 423.217, or for 6 months after the transfer to the authority, whichever is earlier. Negotiations on a collective bargaining agreement with an authority shall begin no later than 180 days before the date the employees transfer to the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Subject to subsection (7), a representative of the employees or group of employees in a municipal emergency service who previously represented or was entitled to represent the employees or group of employees in a municipal emergency service under 1947 PA 336, MCL 423.201 to 423.217, shall continue to represent the employees or group of employees after those employees or group of employees are transferred to the authority's emergency service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) This section does not limit the rights of employees, under applicable law, to assert that a bargaining representative protected by subsection (6) is no longer their representative. The employees of the authority are eligible as of the day the authority becomes effective through its articles of incorporation to choose their representative under 1947 PA 336, MCL 423.201 to 423.217. This subsection does not extend the time limits as provided in subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If multiple labor organizations assert the right to represent all or part of the authority's workforce or where a substantial portion of the transferred employees were not previously represented, in the absence of a voluntary mutual agreement, at the request of any party or on the initiative of the Michigan employment relations commission, the Michigan employment relations commission shall conduct a representation election.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) In the absence of a voluntary mutual agreement, the authority's workforce shall be merged by using a single seniority list for each of the same or similar classifications. The single seniority list shall be composed of all employees from each incorporating municipality employed or having recall rights on the date of transfer and shall be used for purposes that include, but are not limited to, initial assignments, layoffs, recalls, and job bidding. Disputes concerning the single seniority list or use of the single seniority list shall be heard by a single arbitrator appointed by the Michigan employment relations commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Nothing in this section requires a municipality or an authority to assume a collective bargaining agreement between another municipality and its employees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) An employee who left the employ of the municipal emergency response service to enter the military service of the United States shall have the same employment rights as to the emergency service as they would have had under the municipal emergency response service under 1951 PA 263, MCL 35.351 to 35.356.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 12.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    An authority may levy a tax on all of the taxable property within the limits of the authority for the purposes of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The tax authorized under subsection (1) shall not be levied without the approval of a majority of the registered electors residing in the authority affected and qualified to vote and voting on the tax at a general or special election. The election may be called by resolution of the board of the authority. The recording officer of the authority shall file a copy of the resolution of the board calling the election with the clerk of each incorporating municipality not less than 60 days before the date of the election. The resolution calling the election shall contain a statement of the proposition to be submitted to the electors. Each municipal clerk and all other municipal officials of an incorporating municipality shall undertake those steps to properly submit the proposition to the electors of the incorporating municipality at the election specified in the resolutions of the authority. The election shall be conducted and canvassed in accordance with the Michigan election law, Act No. 116 of the Public Acts of 1954, being sections 168.1 to 168.992 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, except that if the authority is located in more than 1 county, the election shall be canvassed by the state board of canvassers. The results of the election shall be certified to the governing body of the authority promptly after the date of the election. Not more than 1 election may be held in an authority in a calendar year for approval of the tax authorized under subsection (1). If the election is a special election, the authority in which the election is held shall pay its share of the costs of the election.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The taxes authorized by this section may be levied at a rate not to exceed 20 mills and for a period as determined by the authority in the resolution calling the election and as shall be set forth in the proposition submitted to the electors.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The tax rate authorized by this section shall be levied and collected as are all ad valorem property taxes in the state, and the recording officer of the authority shall at the appropriate times certify to the proper tax assessing or collecting officers of each tax collecting municipality the amount of taxes to be levied and collected each year by each municipality. The authority shall determine on which tax roll, if there is more than 1, of each incorporating municipality that the taxes authorized by this section shall be collected. Each tax assessing and collecting officer and each county treasurer shall levy and collect the taxes certified by the authority and shall pay those taxes to the authority by the time provided in section 43 of the general property tax act, Act No. 206 of the Public Acts of 1893, being section 211.43 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. The tax rate authorized by this section may be first levied by the authority as a part of the first tax roll of the appropriate municipalities occurring after the election described in subsection (2). The tax may be levied and collected on the December tax roll next following the date of election, if the tax is certified to the proper tax assessing officials not later than September 15 of the year in which the election is held.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   To the extent applicable and consistent with the requirements of this section, the general property tax act, Act No. 206 of the Public Acts of 1893, being sections 211.1 to 211.157 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, shall apply to proceedings in relation to the assessment, spreading, and collection of taxes pursuant to this section. Additionally, in relation to the assessment, spreading, and collection of taxes pursuant to this section, the county treasurer shall have powers and duties similar to those prescribed by Act No. 206 of the Public Acts of 1893, for township supervisors, township clerks, and township treasurers. However, this section shall not be considered to transfer any authority over the assessment of property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A county treasurer collecting taxes pursuant to this section shall be bonded for tax collection in the same amount and in the same manner as a township treasurer would be for undertaking the duties prescribed by this section.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 9.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An authority may initiate an expedited quiet title and foreclosure action under this section to quiet title to real property held by the authority or interests in tax reverted property held by the authority by recording with the register of deeds in the county in which the property subject to expedited quiet title and foreclosure is located a notice of pending expedited quiet title and foreclosure action in a form prescribed by the department of treasury. The notice shall include a legal description of the property, the street address of the property if available, the name, address, and telephone number of the authority, a statement that the property is subject to expedited quiet title proceedings and foreclosure under this act, and a statement that any legal interests in the property may be extinguished by a circuit court order vesting title to the property in the authority. If a notice is recorded in error, the authority may correct the error by recording a certificate of correction with the register of deeds. A notice or certificate under this subsection need not be notarized and may be authenticated by a digital signature or other electronic means. Property is not subject to an expedited quiet title and foreclosure action under this section if the property was forfeited under section 78g of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.78g, and remains subject to foreclosure under section 78k of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.78k. If an authority has reason to believe that a property subject to an expedited quiet title and foreclosure action under this section may be the site of environmental contamination, the authority shall provide the department of environmental quality with any information in the possession of the authority that suggests the property may be the site of environmental contamination.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   After recording the notice under subsection (1), an authority shall initiate a search of records identified in this subsection to identify the owners of a property interest in the property who are entitled to notice of the quiet title and foreclosure hearing under this section. The authority may enter into a contract with or may request from 1 or more authorized representatives a title search or other title product to identify the owners of a property interest in the property as required under this subsection or to perform the other functions set forth in this section required for the quieting of title to property under this act. The owner of a property interest is entitled to notice under this section if that owner's interest was identifiable by reference to any of the following sources before the date that the authority records the notice under subsection (1):</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Land title records in the office of the county register of deeds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Tax records in the office of the county treasurer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Tax records in the office of the local assessor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Tax records in the office of the local treasurer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   An authority may file a single petition with the clerk of the circuit court in which property subject to expedited foreclosure under this section is located listing all property subject to expedited foreclosure by the authority and for which the authority seeks to quiet title. If available to the authority, the list of properties shall include a legal description of, a tax parcel identification number for, and the street address of each parcel of property. The petition shall seek a judgment in favor of the authority against each property listed and shall include a date, within 90 days, on which the authority requests a hearing on the petition. The petition shall request that a judgment be entered vesting absolute title in the authority, without right of redemption for each parcel of property listed, as provided in this section. Prior to the entry of judgment under this section, the authority may request the court to remove property erroneously included in the petition, or any tax delinquent properties redeemed prior to the hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The clerk of the circuit court in which a petition is filed under subsection (3) shall immediately set the date, time, and place for a hearing on the petition for foreclosure. The date shall be set by the clerk and shall not be more than 10 days after the date requested by the authority in the petition. In no event may the clerk schedule the hearing later than 90 days after the filing of a petition by the authority under subsection (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   After completing the records search under subsection (2), an authority shall determine the address or addresses reasonably calculated to inform those owners of a property interest in property subject to expedited foreclosure under this section of the pendency of the quiet title and foreclosure hearing under subsection (11). If, after conducting the title search, the authority is unable to determine an address reasonably calculated to inform persons with a property interest in property subject to expedited tax foreclosure, or if the authority discovers a deficiency in notice under subsection (10), the following shall be considered reasonable steps by the authority to ascertain the addresses of persons with a property interest in the property subject to expedited foreclosure or to ascertain an address necessary to correct a deficiency in notice under subsection (10):</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   For an individual, a search of records of the county probate court for the county in which the property is located.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   For an individual, a search of the qualified voter file established under section 509o of the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.509o, which is authorized by this subdivision.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   For a partnership, a search of partnership records filed with the county clerk.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   For a business entity other than a partnership, a search of business entity records filed with the corporation division of the department.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Not less than 30 days before the quiet title and foreclosure hearing under subsection (11), the authority shall send notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the hearing to the persons identified under subsection (5) with a property interest in property subject to expedited foreclosure. The authority shall also send a notice via regular mail addressed to the "Occupant" for each property subject to expedited foreclosure if an address for the property is ascertainable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Not less than 30 days before the quiet title and foreclosure hearing under subsection (11), the authority or its authorized representative or authorized agent shall visit each parcel of property subject to expedited foreclosure and post conspicuously on the property notice of the hearing.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   If the authority is unable to ascertain the address reasonably calculated to inform the owners of a property interest entitled to notice under this section, or is unable to provide notice under subsection (6) or (7), the authority shall provide notice by publication. Prior to the hearing, a notice shall be published for 3 successive weeks, once each week, in a newspaper published and circulated in the county in which the property is located. If no paper is published in that county, publication shall be made in a newspaper published and circulated in an adjoining county.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   If prior to the quiet title and foreclosure hearing under subsection (11) the authority discovers any deficiency in the provision of notice under this section, the authority shall take reasonable steps in good faith to correct the deficiency before the hearing. The provisions of this section relating to notice of the quiet title and foreclosure hearing are exclusive and exhaustive. Other requirements relating to notice and proof of service under other law, rule, or other legal requirement are not applicable to notice or proof of service under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   If a petition for expedited quiet title and foreclosure is filed under subsection (3), before the hearing, the authority shall file with the clerk of the circuit court proof of notice by certified mail under subsection (6), proof of notice by posting on the property under subsection (7), and proof of notice by publication, if applicable. A person claiming an interest in a parcel of property set forth in the petition for foreclosure who desires to contest that petition shall file written objections with the clerk of the circuit court and serve those objections on the authority before the date of the hearing. The circuit court may appoint and utilize as the court considers necessary a special master for assistance with the resolution of any objections to the foreclosure or questions regarding the title to property subject to foreclosure.

The circuit court's judgment shall specify all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The legal description and, if known, the street address of the property foreclosed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   That fee simple title to property foreclosed by the judgment is vested absolutely in the authority, except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (c) and (e), without any further rights of redemption.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   That all liens against the property, including any lien for unpaid taxes or special assessments, except future installments of special assessments and liens recorded by this state or the authority under the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.101 to 324.90106, are extinguished.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   That, except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (c) and (e), the authority has good and marketable fee simple title to the property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   That all existing recorded and unrecorded interests in that property are extinguished, except a visible or recorded easement or right-of-way, private deed restrictions, plat restrictions, or restrictions or other governmental interests imposed under the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.101 to 324.90106.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   A finding that all persons entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard have been provided that notice and opportunity. A person shall be deemed to have been provided notice and an opportunity to be heard if the authority followed the procedures for provision of notice by mail, for visits to property subject to expedited quiet title and foreclosure, and for publication under this section, or if 1 or more of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The person had constructive notice of the hearing by acquiring an interest in the property after the date of the recording under subsection (1) of the notice of pending expedited quiet title and foreclosure action.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   The person appeared at the hearing under this subsection or submitted written objections to the clerk of the circuit court under this subsection prior to the hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   Prior to the hearing under this subsection, the person had actual notice of the hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (11)(c) and (e), fee simple title to property set forth in a petition for foreclosure filed under subsection (3) shall vest absolutely in the authority upon the effective date of the judgment by the circuit court and the authority shall have absolute title to the property. The authority's title is not subject to any recorded or unrecorded lien, except as provided in subsection (11) and shall not be stayed or held invalid except as provided in subsection (13). A judgment entered under this section is a final order with respect to the property affected by the judgment and shall not be modified, stayed, or held invalid after the effective date of the judgment, except as provided in subsection (14).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   An authority or a person claiming to have a property interest under subsection (2) in property foreclosed under this section may within 21 days of the effective date of the judgment under subsection (12) appeal the circuit court's order or the circuit court's judgment foreclosing property to the court of appeals. An appeal under this subsection is limited to the record of the proceedings in the circuit court under this section. The circuit court's judgment foreclosing property shall be stayed until the court of appeals has reversed, modified, or affirmed that judgment. If an appeal under this subsection stays the circuit court's judgment foreclosing property, the circuit court's judgment is stayed only as to the property that is the subject of that appeal and the circuit court's judgment foreclosing other property that is not the subject of that appeal is not stayed. To appeal the circuit court's judgment foreclosing property, a person appealing the judgment shall pay to the authority any taxes, interest, penalties, and fees due on the property and provide notice of the appeal to the authority within 21 days after the circuit court's judgment is effective. If the circuit court's judgment foreclosing the property is affirmed on appeal, the amount determined to be due shall be refunded to the person who appealed the judgment. If the circuit court's judgment foreclosing the property is reversed or modified on appeal, the authority shall refund the amount determined to be due to the person who appealed the judgment, if any, and forward the balance to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions in accordance with the order of the court of appeals.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(14)   The authority shall record a notice of judgment for each parcel of foreclosed property in the office of the register of deeds for the county in which the foreclosed property is located in a form prescribed by the department of treasury. If an authority records a notice of judgment in error, the authority may subsequently record a certificate of correction. A notice or certificate under this subsection need not be notarized and may be authenticated by a digital signature or other electronic means. After the entry of a judgment foreclosing the property under this section, if the property has not been transferred by the authority, the authority may cancel the foreclosure by recording with the register of deeds of the county in which the property is located a certificate of error in a form prescribed by the department of treasury, if the authority discovers any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The description of the property used in the expedited quiet title and foreclosure proceeding was so indefinite or erroneous that the foreclosure of the property was void.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   An owner of an interest in the property entitled to notice of the expedited quiet title and proceedings against the property under this section was not provided notice sufficient to satisfy the minimum due process requirements of the constitution of this state and the constitution of the United States.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A judgment of foreclosure was entered under this section in violation of an order issued by a United States bankruptcy court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(15)   If a judgment of foreclosure is entered under subsection (12), and all existing recorded and unrecorded interests in a parcel of property are extinguished as provided in subsection (12), the owner of any extinguished recorded or unrecorded interest in that property who claims that he or she did not receive notice of the expedited quiet title and foreclosure action shall not bring an action for possession of the property against any subsequent owner, but may only bring an action to recover monetary damages as provided in this subsection. The court of claims has original and exclusive jurisdiction in any action to recover monetary damages under this subsection. An action to recover monetary damages under this subsection shall not be brought more than 2 years after a judgment for foreclosure is entered under subsection (12). Any monetary damages recoverable under this subsection shall be determined as of the date a judgment for foreclosure is entered under subsection (12) and shall not exceed the fair market value of the interest in the property held by the person bringing the action under this section on that date, less any taxes, interest, penalties, and fees owed on the property as of that date. The right to sue for monetary damages under this subsection shall not be transferable except by testate or intestate succession.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(16)   The owner of a property interest with notice of the quiet title and foreclosure hearing under subsection (11) may not assert any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That notice to the owner was insufficient or inadequate in any way because some other owner of a property interest in the property was not notified.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   That any right to redeem tax reverted property was extended in any way because some other person was not notified.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(17)   A person holding or formerly holding an interest in tax reverted property subject to expedited foreclosure under this section is barred from questioning the validity of the expedited foreclosure under this section if 1 or more of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Prior to the transfer of the property to the authority, the property was deeded to this state under section 67a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.67a, and the person or the person's predecessor in title was notified of a hearing regarding the deeding of the property as required by section 131e of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.131e.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Prior to the transfer of the property to the authority, title to the property vested in a foreclosing governmental unit following a circuit court hearing under section 78k of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.78k, and the person or the person's predecessor in title was notified of the hearing under section 78i of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.78i.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(18)   The failure of an authority to comply with any provision of this section shall not invalidate any proceeding under this section if a person with a property interest in property subject to foreclosure was accorded the minimum due process required under the state constitution of 1963 and the constitution of the United States.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(19)   It is the intent of the legislature that the provisions of this section relating to the expedited quiet title and foreclosure of property by an authority satisfy the minimum requirements of due process required under the constitution of this state and the constitution of the United States but that the provisions do not create new rights beyond those required under the state constitution of 1963 or the constitution of the United States. The failure of an authority, this state, a political subdivision of this state, or a local unit of government to follow a requirement of this section relating to the expedited quiet title and foreclosure of property held by an authority shall not be construed to create a claim or cause of action against an authority, this state, a political subdivision of this state, or a local unit of government unless the minimum requirements of due process accorded under the state constitution of 1963 or the constitution of the United States are violated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(20)   As used in this section, "authorized representative" includes 1 or more of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A title insurance company or agent licensed to conduct business in this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   An attorney licensed to practice law in this state.</DIV>
