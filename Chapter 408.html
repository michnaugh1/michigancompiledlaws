<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this act, an employee shall receive compensation at not less than 1-1/2 times the regular rate at which the employee is employed for employment in a workweek in excess of 40 hours.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) This state or a political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of this state does not violate subsection (1) with respect to the employment of an employee in fire protection activities or an employee in law enforcement activities, including security personnel in correctional institutions, if any of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) In a work period of 28 consecutive days, the employee receives for tours of duty, which in the aggregate exceed 216 hours, compensation for those hours in excess of 216 at a rate not less than 1-1/2 times the regular rate at which the employee is employed. The employee's regular rate shall be not less than the statutory minimum hourly rate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For an employee to whom a work period of at least 7 but less than 28 days applies, in the employee's work period the employee receives for tours of duty, which in the aggregate exceed a number of hours which bears the same ratio to the number of consecutive days in the employee's work period as 216 bears to 28 days, compensation for those excess hours at a rate not less than 1-1/2 times the regular rate at which the employee is employed. The employee's regular rate shall be not less than the statutory minimum hourly rate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If an employee engaged in fire protection activities would receive overtime payments under this act solely as a result of that employee's trading of time with another employee pursuant to a voluntary trading time arrangement, overtime, if any, shall be paid to employees who participate in the trading of time as if the time trade had not occurred. As used in this subdivision, "trading time arrangement" means a practice under which employees of a fire department voluntarily substitute for one another to allow an employee to attend to personal matters, if the practice is neither for the convenience of the employer nor because of the employer's operations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) This state or a political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of this state engaged in the operation of a hospital or an establishment that is an institution primarily engaged in the care of the sick, the aged, or the mentally ill or developmentally disabled who reside on the premises does not violate subsection (1) if both of the following conditions are met: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Pursuant to a written agreement or written employment policy arrived at between the employer and the employee before performance of the work, a work period of 14 consecutive days is accepted instead of the workweek of 7 consecutive days for purposes of overtime computation. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For the employee's employment in excess of 8 hours in a workday and in excess of 80 hours in the 14-day period, the employee receives compensation at a rate of 1-1/2 times the regular rate, which shall be not less than the statutory minimum hourly rate at which the employee is employed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Subsections (1), (2), and (3) do not apply to any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, including an employee employed in the capacity of academic administrative personnel or teacher in an elementary or secondary school. However, an employee of a retail or service establishment is not excluded from the definition of employee employed in a bona fide executive or administrative capacity because of the number of hours in the employee's workweek that the employee devotes to activities not directly or closely related to the performance of executive or administrative activities, if less than 40% of the employee's hours in the workweek are devoted to those activities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An individual who holds a public elective office.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A political appointee of a person holding public elective office or a political appointee of a public body, if the political appointee described in this subdivision is not covered by a civil service system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) An employee employed by an establishment that is an amusement or recreational establishment, if the establishment does not operate for more than 7 months in a calendar year.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) An employee who is not subject to the minimum hourly wage provisions of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The director of the department of licensing and regulatory affairs shall promulgate rules under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, to define the terms used in subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For purposes of administration and enforcement, an amount owing to an employee that is withheld in violation of this section is unpaid minimum wages under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The legislature shall annually appropriate from the general fund to each political subdivision affected by subsection (2) an amount equal to the difference in direct labor costs before and after the effective date of this act arising from any change in existing law that results from the enactment of subsection (2) and incurred by the political subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) In lieu of monetary overtime compensation, an employee subject to this act may receive compensatory time off at a rate that is not less than 1-1/2 hours for each hour of employment for which overtime compensation is required under this act, subject to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The employer must allow employees a total of at least 10 days of leave per year without loss of pay and must provide the compensatory time to the employee under either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Applicable provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, memorandum of understanding, or any other written agreement between the employer and representative of the employee. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agent or other representative designated by the employee, a plan adopted by the employer and provided in writing to its employees that provides employees with a voluntary option to receive compensatory time off for overtime work when there is an express, voluntary written request to the employer by an individual employee for compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay before the performance of any overtime assignment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The employee has not earned compensatory time in excess of the applicable limit prescribed by subdivision (d). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The employee is not required as a condition of employment to accept or request compensatory time. An employer shall not directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten, or coerce or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce an employee for the purpose of interfering with the employee's rights under this section to request or not request compensatory time off in lieu of payment of overtime compensation for overtime hours, or requiring an employee to use compensatory time. In assigning overtime hours, an employer shall not discriminate among employees based upon an employee's choice to request or not request compensatory time off in lieu of overtime compensation. An employer who violates this subsection is subject to a civil fine of not more than $1,000.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) An employee may not accrue more than a total of 240 hours of compensatory time. An employer shall do both of the following:</div>

A nonprofit organization shall obtain a written consent from an employee for deductions to that nonprofit organization that qualify as charitable contributions under federal law. However, this subsection does not require the nonprofit organization to obtain from an employee a separate written consent for each subsequent paycheck from which deductions that qualify as charitable contributions that benefit the employer are made. An employee at any time may rescind in writing his or her authorization to have charitable contributions deducted from his or her paycheck. As used in this subsection, "nonprofit organization" means an organization that is exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 501(c)(3).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The miscalculation, error, or misprint described in subdivision (a) was made by the employer, the employee, or a representative of the employer or employee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The employer provides the employee with a written explanation of the deduction at least 1 pay period before the wage payment affected by the deduction is made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The deduction is not greater than 15% of the gross wages earned in the pay period in which the deduction is made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The deduction is made after the employer has made all deductions expressly permitted or required by law or a collective bargaining agreement, and after any employee-authorized deduction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The deduction does not reduce the regularly scheduled gross wages otherwise due the employee to a rate that is less than the greater of either of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The department may suspend a permit issued under this act for any of the following reasons:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Upon inspection, the ride is determined to be hazardous or unsafe.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An inspection of a ride has been impeded, obstructed, or interfered with.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An owner fails to submit a completed application or pay the required fee within 30 calendar days of March 1.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) An owner fails to request an inspection as required under section 12.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An owner shall not operate a carnival or amusement ride without a permit or while a permit is suspended or revoked. At the request of the director, the attorney general may bring an action seeking a civil fine against the owner of a carnival or amusement ride for a violation of this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For each day that the owner operates a carnival or amusement ride without a permit or while a permit is suspended or revoked in violation of subsection (2), an owner may be ordered to pay a civil fine of $2,500.00. A civil fine collected under this section must be paid to the general fund and credited to the department for performance of its duties under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the department suspends a permit under subsection (1), a reinspection must take place before a permit is reinstated. The owner may request a reinspection when they believe they are in compliance with this act. The reinspection must take place not more than 10 days after the date on which the owner requests the reinspection and the department must give the owner advance notice of the reinspection. If after 3 reinspections, during a suspension period, the department finds the carnival or amusement ride remains noncompliant, the department may revoke the permit for the carnival or amusement ride.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a permit for a carnival or amusement ride is revoked by the department under this section, the owner of the carnival or amusement ride may not apply for another permit or inspection certificate for that ride until March 1 of the year following the year in which the date of the department's ordered revocation occurred. If judicial review is sought and a stay of the revocation is obtained, the owner may not apply for another permit or inspection certificate until March 1 of the year following the year in which the date of a final order of the court sustaining the revocation was entered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) In addition to the remedies provided in this section, and notwithstanding the existence of any other adequate remedy at law, the department may bring an action to enjoin the violation of any provision of this act, or any rule promulgated by the department under this act, in the circuit court of the county in which the violation occurs or is about to occur. On competent and substantial evidence of the violation or threatened violation presented by the department to the court, the court shall immediately issue the temporary or permanent injunction sought by the department. The court shall issue the injunction without bond.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Before the attorney general brings an action seeking a civil fine under this section or before seeking any remedies or penalties under this section for a violation of this act, or any rule promulgated by the department under this act, the department may issue a letter of warning to the owner of the carnival or amusement ride specifying the violation and directing the owner to immediately correct the violation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Subject to section 19a, except for the late payment of fees as provided in section 8(2) and except as provided in subsection (9), a person who violates this act is guilty of a misdemeanor. Each day a violation occurs is a separate offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The penalty provided in subsection (8) does not apply to the violation of this act by a rider or the rider's parent or guardian.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A person shall not install or alter an elevator without first obtaining a permit from the department. The department shall only issue a permit to a person that is licensed by the director as an elevator contractor. Elevator hoistway enclosures shall meet the requirements of the standard. The licensee shall submit detailed plans and specifications of all elevator equipment and the elevator hoistway enclosure, in triplicate, to the department, and approval of those plans and specifications is required before the permit is issued. A person shall apply for a permit on a form provided by the department. The department shall not issue a permit if the appropriate fee is not paid.

An application is considered received on the date the application is received by any agency or department of this state. If an application is considered incomplete by the department, the department shall notify the applicant in writing, or make the information electronically available, within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The 90-day period is tolled from the date the applicant is notified by the department of a deficiency until the date the requested information is received by the department. The determination of the completeness of an application does not operate as an approval of the application for the license or permit and does not confer eligibility of an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license or permit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the department fails to issue or deny a license or permit within the time required by subsection (3), the department shall return the license or permit fee and shall reduce the license or permit fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. A failure to issue a license or permit within the time required under this section does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and the department shall place that application, when completed, in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based on the fact that the license or permit fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The director of the department shall submit a report by December 1 of each year to the standing committees and appropriations subcommittees of the senate and house of representatives concerned with occupational issues.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) This state or a political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of this state does not violate subsection (1) with respect to the employment of an employee in fire protection activities or an employee in law enforcement activities, including security personnel in correctional institutions, if any of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) In a work period of 28 consecutive days, the employee receives for tours of duty, which in the aggregate exceed 216 hours, compensation for those hours in excess of 216 at a rate not less than 1-1/2 times the regular rate at which the employee is employed. The employee's regular rate shall be not less than the statutory minimum hourly rate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For an employee to whom a work period of at least 7 but less than 28 days applies, in the employee's work period the employee receives for tours of duty, which in the aggregate exceed a number of hours which bears the same ratio to the number of consecutive days in the employee's work period as 216 bears to 28 days, compensation for those excess hours at a rate not less than 1-1/2 times the regular rate at which the employee is employed. The employee's regular rate shall be not less than the statutory minimum hourly rate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If an employee engaged in fire protection activities would receive overtime payments under this act solely as a result of that employee's trading of time with another employee pursuant to a voluntary trading time arrangement, overtime, if any, shall be paid to employees who participate in the trading of time as if the time trade had not occurred. As used in this subdivision, "trading time arrangement" means a practice under which employees of a fire department voluntarily substitute for one another to allow an employee to attend to personal matters, if the practice is neither for the convenience of the employer nor because of the employer's operations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) This state or a political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of this state engaged in the operation of a hospital or an establishment that is an institution primarily engaged in the care of the sick, the aged, or the mentally ill or developmentally disabled who reside on the premises does not violate subsection (1) if both of the following conditions are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Pursuant to a written agreement or written employment policy arrived at between the employer and the employee before performance of the work, a work period of 14 consecutive days is accepted instead of the workweek of 7 consecutive days for purposes of overtime computation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For the employee's employment in excess of 8 hours in a workday and in excess of 80 hours in the 14-day period, the employee receives compensation at a rate of 1-1/2 times the regular rate, which shall be not less than the statutory minimum hourly rate at which the employee is employed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Subsections (1), (2), and (3) do not apply to any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, including an employee employed in the capacity of academic administrative personnel or teacher in an elementary or secondary school. However, an employee of a retail or service establishment is not excluded from the definition of employee employed in a bona fide executive or administrative capacity because of the number of hours in the employee's workweek that the employee devotes to activities not directly or closely related to the performance of executive or administrative activities, if less than 40% of the employee's hours in the workweek are devoted to those activities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An individual who holds a public elective office.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A political appointee of a person holding public elective office or a political appointee of a public body, if the political appointee described in this subdivision is not covered by a civil service system.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) An employee who is not subject to the minimum hourly wage provisions of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The director of the department of licensing and regulatory affairs shall promulgate rules under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, to define the terms used in subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For purposes of administration and enforcement, an amount owing to an employee that is withheld in violation of this section is unpaid minimum wages under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The legislature shall annually appropriate from the general fund to each political subdivision affected by subsection (2) an amount equal to the difference in direct labor costs before and after the effective date of this act arising from any change in existing law that results from the enactment of subsection (2) and incurred by the political subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) In lieu of monetary overtime compensation, an employee subject to this act may receive compensatory time off at a rate that is not less than 1-1/2 hours for each hour of employment for which overtime compensation is required under this act, subject to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The employer must allow employees a total of at least 10 days of leave per year without loss of pay and must provide the compensatory time to the employee under either of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The employee has not earned compensatory time in excess of the applicable limit prescribed by subdivision (d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The employee is not required as a condition of employment to accept or request compensatory time. An employer shall not directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten, or coerce or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce an employee for the purpose of interfering with the employee's rights under this section to request or not request compensatory time off in lieu of payment of overtime compensation for overtime hours, or requiring an employee to use compensatory time. In assigning overtime hours, an employer shall not discriminate among employees based upon an employee's choice to request or not request compensatory time off in lieu of overtime compensation. An employer who violates this subsection is subject to a civil fine of not more than $1,000.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) An employee may not accrue more than a total of 240 hours of compensatory time. An employer shall do both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Maintain in an employee's pay record a statement of compensatory time earned by that employee in the pay period that the pay record identifies.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Upon the request of an employee who has earned compensatory time, the employer shall, within 30 days following the request, provide monetary compensation for that compensatory time at a rate not less than the regular rate earned by the employee at the time the employee performed the overtime work.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) An employee who has earned compensatory time authorized under this subsection shall, upon the voluntary or involuntary termination of employment or upon expiration of this subsection, be paid unused compensatory time at a rate of compensation not less than the regular rate earned by the employee at the time the employee performed the overtime work.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) An employee shall be permitted to use any compensatory time accrued under this subsection for any reason unless use of the compensatory time for the period requested will unduly disrupt the operations of the employer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Unless prohibited by a collective bargaining agreement, an employer may terminate a compensatory time plan upon not less than 60 days' notice to employees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) As used in this subsection:</div>

In addition to the standard incorporated by reference in this subsection, sections 14b to 14l apply to an employer subject to this act.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Beginning November 25, 1985, employers who are chemical manufacturers in a classification provided by sector 31-33 — manufacturing, of the North American industry classification system, United States, 1997, published by the office of management and budget or in a standard industrial classification of 20 through 39 of the standard industrial classification code published by the federal department of management and budget, importers, and distributors shall label containers of hazardous chemicals leaving their workplaces, provide safety data sheets with initial shipments, and otherwise comply with any applicable provision of the standard incorporated by reference pursuant to subsection (1) and of sections 14b to 14l. A chemical manufacturer, importer, or distributor subject to this subsection shall provide a safety data sheet and an appropriately labeled container to each employer in this state, regardless of the employer's standard industrial classification in the standard industrial classification code, who purchases a hazardous chemical.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Beginning May 25, 1986, an employer in a classification provided by sector 31-33 — manufacturing, of the North American industry classification system, United States, 1997, published by the office of management and budget or in a standard industrial classification of 20 through 39 of the standard industrial classification code published by the federal department of management and budget shall comply with the requirements of the standard incorporated by reference pursuant to subsection (1) and with sections 14b to 14l with respect to the use of hazardous chemicals in the workplace.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An exposed employee, a health professional providing medical or other occupational health services to exposed employees, or an authorized employee representative of an exposed employee may petition the director to review a denial of a written request for disclosure of a specific chemical identity. This review shall be conducted as a contested case pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, and shall be confidential.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) When promulgating occupational health standards, the director shall promulgate a standard that most adequately assures, to the extent feasible and on the basis of the best available evidence, that an employee will not suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity, even if the employee has regular exposure to a hazard dealt with by the standard for the period of his or her working life.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The director shall promulgate an emergency standard pursuant to section 48 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.248, if the director finds that employees are exposed to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful and the emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from that danger.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An occupational health standard shall prescribe appropriate forms of warning that are necessary to insure that employees are apprised of health hazards to which they are exposed, relevant symptoms, and the conditions and precautions for safe use or exposure, including appropriate emergency treatment. If appropriate, a standard shall prescribe suitable protective equipment, control, or technological procedures to be used and shall require an employer to monitor or measure employee exposure, to allow employees or their representatives to observe the monitoring and have access to the records of the monitoring, and to conduct the monitoring in a manner that is necessary for the protection of the employees' health. Former employees shall have access to the records indicating their exposure to toxic materials and harmful physical agents.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If appropriate, the director shall prescribe by standard that medical examinations or tests are made available, at the employer's cost, to employees to determine if they are adversely affected by exposure to health hazards. If the examination is performed by a physician other than a physician who is retained for that purpose by the employer, the employer is responsible only for the reasonable costs of the examination, and only for costs related to the performance of the examination required by the standard. The results of the examinations or tests shall be furnished to the employer, the employee, and upon request of the employee, to the employee's personal physician. Upon request of the director, the employer shall furnish results of the examinations or tests to the director. However, this act does not authorize or require medical examinations, immunizations, or treatments for those who object to them on religious grounds, except if necessary for the protection of the health or safety of others.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 27.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An employer may apply to the department of labor or the department of public health for a temporary order granting a variance from a standard or a provision thereof. A temporary order shall be granted only if the employer files an application which meets the requirements of subsection (2) and establishes that the employer is unable to comply with a standard by its effective date because of unavailability of professional or technical personnel or of materials and equipment needed to come into compliance with the standard or because necessary construction or alteration of facilities cannot be completed by the effective date, that the employer is taking all available steps to safeguard his employees against the hazards covered by the standard, and that the employer has an effective program for complying with the standard as quickly as practicable. A temporary order issued under this subsection shall prescribe the practices, means, methods, operations, and processes which the employer shall adopt and use while the order is in effect, and state in detail the employer's program for complying with the standard. A temporary order may be granted only after notice to employees and an opportunity for a hearing. However, the department of labor or the department of public health may issue an interim order to be effective until a decision is made on the basis of the hearing. A temporary order may not be in effect for longer than the period needed by the employer to achieve compliance with the standard or 1 year, whichever is lesser, except that the order may be renewed not more than twice so long as the requirements of this subsection are met and if an application for renewal is filed not less than 90 days before the expiration date of the order. An interim renewal of an order may not remain in effect for longer than 180 days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An application for a temporary order under this section shall contain:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A specification of the standard or portion thereof from which the employer seeks a variance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A statement by the employer that he is unable to comply with the standard or portion thereof and a detailed statement of the reasons therefor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A statement of the steps the employer has taken and will take, with specific dates, to protect employees against the hazard covered by the standard.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A statement of when the employer shall comply with the standard and what steps the employer has taken and will take, with dates specified, to comply with the standard.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   A certification that the employer has informed his employees of the application by giving a copy thereof to their authorized representative, posting a statement giving a summary of the application, and specifying where a copy may be examined at the place or places where notices to employees are normally posted and by other appropriate means. A description of how employees were informed shall be contained in the certification. The information to employees shall also inform the employees of their right to petition the department of labor or the department of public health for a hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The department of labor or the department of public health may grant a variance from a standard or a portion thereof when it determines that the variance is necessary to permit an employer to participate in an experiment approved by it designed to demonstrate or validate new and improved techniques to safeguard the health or safety of workers.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   An affected employer may apply to the appropriate department for a rule or an order for a variance from a standard. Affected employees or their representatives shall be given notice of each application and an opportunity to participate in a hearing. The appropriate department shall issue a rule or an order if it determines on the record, after opportunity for an inspection where appropriate and a hearing, that the proponent of the variance has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the conditions, practices, means, methods, operations, or processes used or proposed to be used by an employer will provide employment and places of employment to his employees which are as safe and healthful as those which would prevail if he complied with the standard. The rule or order issued shall prescribe the conditions the employer shall maintain and the practices, means, methods, operations, and processes which he shall adopt and utilize to the extent they differ from the standard in question. The rule or the order may be modified or revoked upon application by an employer, employees, their representatives, or by the appropriate department on its own motion under this subsection at any time after 6 months from its issuance.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 28.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An employee or employee representative, who believes that a violation of a standard exists that threatens physical harm to an employee, may request an inspection by giving written notice of the condition to the appropriate department. The notice shall set forth with reasonable detail the grounds for the request and shall be signed by the employee or employee representative giving the notice. Upon receipt of a complaint, and if the department determines there are reasonable grounds for the complaint, the department shall conduct an inspection. A copy of the request shall be provided the employer or the employer's agent not later than the time of the inspection. Upon the request of the person giving the notice, his or her name and the names of employees referred to in the notice shall not appear in the copy or on a record which is published, released, or made available. If the department determines that there are not reasonable grounds to believe that an inspection should be conducted, it shall notify, in writing, the complainant of its determination.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If an employee or employee representative believes that a condition exists which may present an imminent danger to a person, the employee or employee representative may notify either the department of labor or the department of public health in the most expedient manner without regard to a written notice. Upon notification of an alleged imminent danger, the department shall cause an immediate inspection to be made or take other action that it finds necessary to abate the danger.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Before or during an inspection of a place of employment, an employee, or a representative of employees, may notify the department representative responsible for conducting the inspection, in writing, of a violation of this act or of a rule promulgated under this act, which the employee or employee representative believes exists in the place of employment. If the department determines, after an inspection or investigation conducted upon a written notification from an employee or employee representative of an alleged violation, that there are not reasonable grounds to believe that the alleged violation exists, it shall notify, in writing, the complainant and the employer of its determination. Upon request of the person giving the notice, that person's name and the names of employees referred to in the notice shall not appear in the copy or on a record which is published, released, or made available to the employer or any other person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The department of labor and the department of public health shall establish procedures for informal review of any decision resulting from a request or notice, under this section, to inspect for an alleged violation. The appropriate department shall furnish the employees or representative of employees requesting a review a written statement of the final disposition of the notice or complaint and reasons for the disposition.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   An employee or the representative of the employee shall be afforded an opportunity, with or without compensation, to attend all meetings between the department of labor or the department of public health and an employer relative to that department's decision concerning a citation, abatement period, or proposed penalty.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 29.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   To implement this act, a department representative, upon presenting appropriate credentials, may enter without delay, and at reasonable times, a place of employment to physically inspect or investigate conditions of employment and all pertinent conditions, equipment, and materials in the place of employment, and to question privately the employer, owner, operator, agent, or an employee with respect to safety or health. The inspection or investigation shall be conducted without unreasonably disrupting the employer's operations.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If permission to enter a place of employment is denied, the department may apply to the proper judicial officer for a warrant commanding the sheriff or a peace officer to aid the department in the conduct of an inspection or investigation to determine if there is a violation of this act or a rule promulgated under this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In the conduct of inspections and investigations, the appropriate department may require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence under oath. Witnesses shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the circuit courts. In case of a contumacy, failure, or a refusal of a person to obey an order, the circuit court within the jurisdiction of which the investigation is conducted, or where the person is found or resides or transacts business, or the circuit court for the county of Ingham, upon application of the appropriate department, may issue an order requiring the person to appear and produce evidence or give testimony relating to the matter under investigation or in question, and a failure to obey the order of the court may be punished as a contempt.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A representative of the employer and a representative authorized by the employees shall be given the opportunity to accompany the department representative during the inspection or investigation of a place of employment to aid the inspection or investigation, subject to rules promulgated by the department. In case of controversy, the department representative, at the time he or she goes into an establishment, shall determine who may walk around as employer and employee representatives. If a representative authorized by the employee does not participate, the department representative shall consult with a reasonable number of employees concerning matters of safety or health in the place of employment. The right of accompaniment may be denied by the department representative to a person whose conduct interferes with a fair and orderly inspection or investigation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   In conducting or preparing to conduct an inspection or investigation, advance notice of the inspection or investigation shall not be given except in the following situations:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   In cases of apparent imminent danger, to enable the employer to abate the danger as quickly as possible.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   In circumstances where the inspection most effectively can be conducted after regular business hours or where special preparations are necessary for an inspection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If necessary to assure the presence of representatives of the employer and employees, or the appropriate personnel needed to aid in the inspection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   In other circumstances where the department determines that the giving of advance notice would enhance the probability of an effective and thorough inspection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Advance notice in any of the situations described in subsection (5) shall not be given more than 24 hours before the inspection or investigation is scheduled to be conducted, except in apparent imminent danger situations and in other unusual circumstances.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   During the conduct of an inspection or an investigation, the department representative may conduct tests and gather samples of materials and substances as are necessary to aid in the evaluation of the place of employment. In implementing this subsection, the confidentiality of trade secrets shall be protected as prescribed in this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Subject to rules promulgated by the departments, following the completion of an inspection or investigation, an opportunity for a conference shall be afforded the employer; the employee or employee representative; and the employer and the employee or employee representative if a joint conference is requested.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) When and as soon as a department representative determines that an imminent danger exists in a place of employment, the department representative shall inform the employer and the affected employees of a determination of the imminent danger. The department representative immediately shall recommend to the director that an order be issued to require that steps be taken as may be necessary to avoid, correct, or remove the imminent danger. After receiving authorization for the issuance of an order from the director, the department representative shall apply a tag to the equipment or process that is the source of the imminent danger identifying that an imminent danger exists. The tag shall be removed only by the department representative. At request of the employer, an area supervisor shall, within 24 hours after a request, make an on site review of any tagging and recommend continuance or removal. The order shall prohibit the employment or presence of an individual in locations or under conditions where imminent danger exists, except individuals whose presence is necessary to avoid, correct, or remove the imminent danger in a safe and orderly manner. In tagging the equipment or process that is the source of imminent danger and in issuing the order, consideration shall be given to any necessity to maintain the capacity of a continuous process operation and to the reestablishment of normal operations without a complete cessation of operations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An employer shall not permit an employee, other than an employee whose presence is necessary to avoid, correct, or remove the imminent danger, to operate equipment or engage in a process that has been tagged by the department and that is the subject of an order issued by the department identifying that an imminent danger exists. An employee who suffers a loss of wages or fringe benefits or is in any manner discriminated against for refusing to operate equipment or engage in a process that has been tagged by the department and that is the subject of an order issued by the department, as provided in this section, may file a discrimination complaint, and the department of licensing and regulatory affairs may order appropriate relief as provided in section 65. This section does not prohibit an employer from assigning an employee to an operation not affected by the imminent danger situation, subject to any collective bargaining agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Upon failure of the employer to promptly comply with a department order, as described in subsection (1), the department shall petition the circuit court having jurisdiction to restrain a condition or practice in a place of employment that the department has determined to cause the imminent danger.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the department arbitrarily or capriciously fails to seek relief under this section, an employee who may be injured by reason of the failure, or the representative of those employees, may bring action against the department in the circuit court having jurisdiction for a writ of mandamus to compel the department to seek an order and for further relief, as may be appropriate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The department of licensing and regulatory affairs shall respond within 24 hours after receipt of an imminent danger complaint concerning an unknown and unlabeled container of chemicals or an imminent danger complaint concerning a container of hazardous chemicals that is not labeled or for which a safety data sheet is not available as required by the standard incorporated by reference in section 14a and by sections 14b to 14l.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Before a department representative seeks authorization to issue an order pursuant to the procedures prescribed in subsection (1), an employer shall be given a reasonable opportunity to identify, label, or provide the safety data sheet for the container that is the subject of the imminent danger determination.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If, as the result of an inspection or investigation, the department representative believes that an employer has violated this act, an order issued pursuant to this act, or a rule or standard promulgated pursuant to this act, he or she shall issue a citation immediately or within 90 days after the completion of the physical inspection or investigation. The citation shall be in writing and shall describe with particularity the nature of the violation, including a reference to the provision of this act, or an order issued or a rule or standard promulgated pursuant to this act, alleged to have been violated. The citation shall state a reasonable time by which the violation is to be abated. The citation shall state on its face that it is an allegation of a violation. The date shall be set with due regard to the seriousness of the hazard and the difficulty of abating it. The citation and the proposed penalty, if any, may be presented to and shall, in each case, be sent by registered mail to the employer, and a copy shall be filed at the time of issuance with the appropriate department.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The employer shall post a copy of the citation at or near the place of the violation, and the citation copy shall remain posted at that site until compliance is achieved or for 3 working days, whichever is later.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The employer upon whom a citation is served shall notify the appropriate department of compliance with this act, an order issued pursuant to this act, or a rule or standard promulgated pursuant to this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If an employer fails to correct a violation for which a citation was issued within the period permitted for its correction, the department shall notify the employer by registered mail of that failure and of the penalty proposed to be assessed under section 35 for the failure.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If it is determined upon inspection or investigation that a violation of this act, an order issued pursuant to this act, or a rule or standard promulgated pursuant to this act exists, but that the conditions that constitute the violation have no direct or immediate relationship to the safety or health of workers, the department may issue a notice in place of a citation. A notice issued under this subsection shall be referred to as a "de minimis notice of violation". The employer shall post a copy of the de minimis notice of violation at or near the place of violation for 3 working days. The department shall promulgate all necessary rules for administering the de minimis notice of violation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A citation for an alleged violation of this act, an order issued pursuant to this act, or a rule or standard promulgated pursuant to this act shall be vacated if it is shown that the employer has provided the equipment or training, educated employees regarding use of the equipment or implementation of the training, and taken reasonable steps including, where appropriate, disciplinary action to assure that employees utilize the equipment and comply with the training as referenced in this section.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 55.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A safety education and training fund is created. Except as provided in subsection (2), the fund shall be used to accomplish the objectives outlined in sections 54 and 56. The state treasurer shall be custodian of the fund and may invest the surplus of the fund in investments as in the state treasurer's judgment are in the best interest of the state. Earnings from those investments shall be credited to the fund. The state treasurer shall notify the director of labor, the director of public health, and the legislature of interest credited and the balance of the safety education and training fund as of December 31 of each year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   On October 1, 1991, $2,300,000.00 is transferred from the safety education and training fund to the state general fund for the operation of the programs specified in this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The director of labor shall supervise and administer the fund. Except as provided in this section, the director shall annually assess a levy based on the total annual worker's disability compensation losses, excluding medical payments, paid in the immediately preceding calendar year by employers under the worker's disability compensation act of 1969, Act No. 317 of the Public Acts of 1969, as amended, being sections 418.101 to 418.941 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. Except as provided in this section, each year the director shall assess upon and collect from each carrier and self-insured employer a sum equal to that proportion of 50% of the current fiscal year appropriation of safety education and training funds which the total worker's disability compensation benefits, exclusive of medical payments, paid by each carrier or each self-insured employer bears to the total of the compensation benefits paid by all carriers and self-insured employers during the immediately preceding calendar year. However, the total amount levied annually shall not exceed 3/4 of 1% of the total of the compensation benefits paid by all carriers and self-insured employers during the immediately preceding calendar year. Funds that are unexpended at the end of each fiscal year shall be returned to the safety education and training fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If at any time during the fiscal year in which the assessment required by subsection (3) is made the balance of money in the safety education and training fund is less than $1,500,000.00, the assessment shall equal the total fiscal year appropriation of safety education and training funds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Notice of the assessments shall be sent by the director of labor by mail to each carrier. Payment of assessments shall be received in the principal office of the department of labor before a date specified uniformly in the notice, but not less than 90 days after the date of mailing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The levy assessments shall constitute an element of loss for the purpose of establishing rates for worker's disability compensation insurance. Funds derived from this levy shall be deposited in the safety education and training fund and shall be appropriated by the legislature for the operation of this program.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   To enable full and complete legislative review of the assessment process, the department of labor, not later than September 30 of each year, shall submit to the regulatory subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees and the house and senate committees that consider labor matters a written report on the status of the safety education and training assessment required by this section. The report shall include, but is not limited to, information on the amount of the assessment, the percentage of the assessment as compared to losses, an explanation of all expenditures from the safety education and training fund, and the balance of money in the safety education and training fund.</DIV>
