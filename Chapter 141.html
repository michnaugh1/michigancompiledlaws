For any permanent improvement that may lawfully be made by the county authorities on the faith and credit of the county, the bonds of the county may be issued and sold to raise the money to pay for the improvement, or the bonds may be issued and negotiated to secure the payment of indebtedness incurred in making the permanent improvements.

</P>
<P>Sec. 7.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   For the purpose of defraying the whole or a part of project costs, a public corporation may borrow money and issue its negotiable bonds. The bonds shall not be issued unless and until authorized by an ordinance, which shall set forth a brief description of the contemplated project, the estimated cost of the project, and the amount, maximum rate of interest, and time of payment of the bonds. The bonds shall be serial bonds or term bonds, or a combination of serial and term bonds, and shall be payable semiannually or annually by maturity of serial bonds or maturity or required redemption of term bonds. The last annual principal installment shall be not longer than the estimated period of usefulness of the public improvement for which the bond is issued, but the last installment shall not be more than 40 years from the date of the bond. The bonds shall bear interest, payable as provided in the authorizing ordinance, except that the first interest installment shall be payable not later than 10 months following the delivery date of the bonds. The bonds and coupons shall be substantially in the form provided in the authorizing ordinance and shall be executed in the manner prescribed in the bond, which may be by facsimile signature or signatures. The bonds and the interest on the bonds shall be made payable in lawful money of the United States, and shall be exempt from taxation by this state or by any taxing authority within this state. The public corporation may provide that the redemption of term bonds may be satisfied in whole or in part by the purchase and cancellation of term bonds otherwise required to be redeemed. As used in this subsection, "annual principal installment" means a maturity of serial bonds, an amount of term bonds required to be redeemed in that year, or a maturity of term bonds less amounts previously required to be redeemed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The principal of and interest on the bonds shall be payable, except as provided in this act, solely from the net revenues derived from the operation of the public improvement purchased, acquired, constructed, improved, enlarged, extended, or repaired from the proceeds of the bonds, as shall be pledged to the bonds in the authorizing ordinance, which may include if the ordinance so provides, net revenues derived by reason of future improvements, enlargements, extensions, or repairs to the improvement, and payments made to the public corporation issuing the bonds by any other governmental entity pursuant to another law of this state or the United States for payment of principal and interest on the bonds, even though the payments are made from or include grants or other funds provided by this state or the United States or the proceeds of taxes levied on taxable property as provided by other law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   As additional security for the payment of bonds that are used to finance the local share of projects that receive more than 25% of financing from federal or state grants or that are being initially purchased, in whole or in part, by the Michigan municipal bond authority created under the shared credit rating act, 1985 PA 227, MCL 141.1051 to 141.1076, or if specifically authorized by another law pertaining to the public improvements for which bonds are to be issued under this act, a public corporation, by majority vote of the elected members of its governing body, may include as a part of the ordinance authorizing the issuance of the bonds a pledge of its full faith and credit for payment of the principal of an interest on the bonds. For bonds issued for airports or airport improvements under the aeronautics code of the state of Michigan, 1945 PA 327, MCL 259.1 to 259.208, a public corporation, by majority vote of the elected members of its governing body, may agree that if funds pledged for payment of bonds are not sufficient to pay principal and interest on the bonds as the bonds become due, the public corporation shall advance sufficient funds out of its general funds for the payment if the proceeds of the bonds are used exclusively within the territorial limits of the county in which the political corporation is located. If a pledge is made, and the net revenues primarily pledged to the payment are insufficient to make a payment, the public corporation shall be obligated to pay the bonds and interest on the bonds in the same manner and to the same extent as other general obligation bonds of the public corporation, including the levy, when necessary, of a tax on all taxable property in the public corporation without limitation as to rate or amount, in addition to all other taxes that the public corporation is authorized to levy, but not exceeding the rate or amount necessary to make the payment. If a public corporation makes payment from taxes or general funds pursuant to a full faith and credit pledge or agreement to advance, it shall be reimbursed from net revenues subsequently received by the public improvement for which the bonds are issued that are not otherwise pledged or encumbered. A bond or coupon issued under this act shall not be general obligation or constitute an indebtedness of the borrower unless its full faith and credit are pledged. Unless a public corporation pledges its full faith and credit for the payment of bonds issued pursuant to this act, or unless otherwise exempt, the amount of the bonds shall not be included in computing the net bonded indebtedness of the public corporation for the purposes of debt limitations imposed by any statutory or charter provisions. Bonds may be made registerable as to principal, or principal and interest, under terms and conditions determined by the governing body of the borrower.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The governing body in the ordinance authorizing the bonds or in an agreement entered into under section 7a(1)(a) may pledge any funds established by the ordinance or agreement for the payment of the bonds or other obligations of the public corporation under the agreement and create a statutory first lien in favor of the holders of the bonds or a party subject to the agreement.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    A public corporation in determining to issue bonds, including refunding bonds, may do the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   As additional security to assure timely payment of the bonds, authorize and enter into an insurance contract, agreement for lines of credit, letter of credit, commitment to purchase obligations, remarketing agreement, reimbursement agreement, tender agreement, and any other transaction to provide security to assure timely payment of any bond, and may pledge and create a statutory lien on 1 or more of the following for timely payment of the bonds or payment of any obligations of the public corporation under any of the foregoing:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)    Deliver bonds partly to refund bonds and partly for any other authorized purpose.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the bonds are additionally secured as provided in subsection (1)(a) and notwithstanding other provisions of this act, the bonds, including an obligation of the public corporation to a provider of additional security under subsection (1)(a) relating to that additional security, may be made payable on demand or prior to maturity at the option of the public corporation or the holder, or made subject to a tender, right, or obligation, at the time and in the manner determined by the governing body in the ordinance authorizing the bonds.

If so provided by the governing body in the ordinance authorizing the bonds, bonds which are additionally secured under the provisions of subsection (1)(a) may contain provisions under which the holders of the bonds may be considered to have tendered the bonds pursuant to the ordinance and the bonds. For purposes of determining the aggregate authorized amount of bonds outstanding, bonds which are considered tendered are no longer outstanding and may be replaced without redemption by bonds which may be sold or remarketed as provided in this subsection without the sale or remarketing being a reissuance or refunding.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The remarketing or resale of tendered bonds or the incurrence of an obligation of the public corporation pursuant to an agreement providing additional security under subsection (1)(a) is not subject to referendum by the qualified electors of the public corporation pursuant to section 33 and may be sold or remarketed in the case of tendered bonds, or incurred in the case of an obligation pursuant to an agreement providing additional security under section 7a(1)(a), at public or private sale as determined by the governing body in the ordinance authorizing the bonds. The remarketing or resale of tendered bonds is not subject to the prior approval of the department of treasury as provided in this act if the original issue of bonds to which the tendered bonds or agreement relates was approved or excepted from approval by the department of treasury. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The provisions of this section specify general authority under this act, may be exercised notwithstanding a charter provision to the contrary, and may be included in bonds issued before the effective date of this section which bonds are ratified and validated by this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The amendatory act which added this section shall not be construed to expand or diminish the authority of a public corporation to pledge its full faith and credit without a referendum of the qualified electors. </DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A county treasurer in any county that has continued a delinquent tax revolving fund under section 87b of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.87b, and that has authorized the issuance of notes under this act pursuant to section 87f of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.87f, may by order of the county treasurer and without a vote of the electors borrow money and issue its revenue notes on behalf of itself and the local units of government secured by delinquent tax revenues from the county's delinquent tax revolving fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In the order authorizing the borrowing and issuance of notes, the delinquent tax revenues from which the borrowing is to be repaid shall be pledged as security for the payment of the principal and interest on the notes. Money and other property held in the delinquent tax revolving fund, including collections on the delinquent tax revenues, shall be kept separate from and shall not be commingled with any other money in the custody of the county treasurer. The segregated fund or account shall be established as a part of the delinquent tax revolving fund and shall be accounted for separately on the books of the county treasurer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The proceeds of the notes shall be placed in and used as the whole or part of the delinquent tax revolving fund established under section 87b of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.87b, after the expenses of borrowing have been deducted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The notes issued pursuant to this section shall comply with all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Be in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the aggregate amount of all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The delinquent tax revenues pledged, exclusive of interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) At the option of the county treasurer, and to the extent authorized under section 87f of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.87f, a note reserve fund in an amount not to exceed 15% of each borrowing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The cost of issuance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Bear interest not exceeding 14.5% per annum.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Be in those denominations, and mature on the date not exceeding 6 years after their date of issue, as the county treasurer by order determines.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) May be issued at an original issue discount not to exceed 2% of the face value of the note issued.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The order authorizing issuance of the notes may provide that all or part of the notes shall be subject to prepayment and, if subject to prepayment, shall provide the amount of call premium payable, if any, the number of days' notice of prepayment that shall be given, and whether the notice shall be written or published, or both. Otherwise, the notes shall not be subject to prepayment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The sale and award of notes shall be conducted and made by the county treasurer at a public or private sale. If a public sale is held, the notes shall be advertised for sale once not less than 5 days before sale in a publication printed in the English language and circulated in this state that carries as a part of its regular service notices of the sales of municipal bonds and that has been designated in the resolution as a publication complying with these qualifications. The notice of sale shall be in the form designated by the county treasurer. The notes may be sold subject to the option of the county treasurer, and the county treasurer may withhold a part of the issue from delivery if, in his or her opinion, sufficient funds are available before delivery of the notes to make full delivery unnecessary to the purposes of the borrowing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the county board of commissioners provides by resolution, the notes may also be limited tax full-faith and credit obligations of the county subject to the state constitution of 1963 as to the levying of any taxes not authorized by the voters or by law unless the county has held an election pursuant to section 87d of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.87d, if the county's voters have approved the proposition found in section 87d(1) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.87d, permitting the county to pledge the county's unlimited taxing power for the purpose of providing money for the delinquent tax revolving fund. If the proceeds of the taxes pledged are not sufficient to pay the principal and interest of the notes when due, the county shall impose a general ad valorem tax without limitation as to rate or amount on all taxable property in the county to pay the principal and interest and may reimburse itself from delinquent taxes collected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the county board of commissioners provides by resolution, the notes may be secured additionally by a pledge of the county's general fund and are subject to all the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The notes shall be designated general obligation limited tax notes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The notes shall be the full faith and credit obligations of the county issuing them. If the proceeds of the taxes and interest and, when pledged, county property tax administration fees, or note reserve fund are not sufficient to pay the principal and interest, when due, the county shall pay the principal and interest from its general funds or any additional tax which may be levied within its constitutional and statutory debt limits, and the county may subsequently reimburse itself from delinquent taxes collected. The county's obligation to pay from its general funds shall be its first budget obligation and shall be provided for in the borrowing resolution in the following language:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>"This note issue, in addition, shall be a general obligation of the county of _________, secured by its full faith and credit, which shall include this county's limited tax obligation, within applicable constitutional and statutory limits, and its general funds. The county budget shall provide that if the pledged delinquent taxes and any other pledged amounts are not collected in sufficient amounts to meet the payments of principal and interest due on these notes, the county, before paying any other budgeted amounts, will promptly advance from its general funds sufficient money to pay that principal and interest.".</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, all the following apply:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Secured by a letter of credit issued by a bank under an agreement entered into by the county treasurer or by any other collateral that the county treasurer's order may authorize.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Callable as set forth in the order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Reissued by the county treasurer once reacquired by the county treasurer under any put or repurchase agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The county treasurer may by order do 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Authorize the issuance of renewal notes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Refund or refund in advance notes by the issuance of new notes, whether the notes to be refunded have or have not matured.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Issue notes partly to refund notes and partly for any other purposes authorized by this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Buy and sell any notes issued under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Renewal, refunding, or advance refunding notes shall comply with all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Shall be sold and the proceeds applied to the purchase redemption or payment of the notes to be renewed or refunded.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Shall not be subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) May be sold or resold at a public or private sale.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) May pledge the delinquent taxes pledged in the issue to be refunded in advance after the original issue is defeased by the advance refunding issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Notes may be issued and secured by a second lien on delinquent tax revenues, interest, and property tax administration fees already the subject of a first lien because of the issuance of a prior note issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Any notes issued may be secured in whole or in part under a trust or escrow agreement, which agreement may also govern the issuance of renewal notes, refunding notes, and advance refunding notes. The agreement may authorize the trustee or escrow agent to make investments of any type authorized in the agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The notes issued under this section and interest on the notes shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America and shall be exempt from all taxation by this state or a taxing authority in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The notes issued under this section may be made payable at a bank or trust company, or may be made registrable as to principal or as to principal and interest under the terms and conditions specified in the authorizing resolution or by the county treasurer when awarding the notes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) To the extent authorized under section 87f of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.87f, a county treasurer shall have all the powers granted by this act to a public corporation and shall exercise those powers by order. A copy of that order shall be maintained in the records of the county treasurer, and a second copy shall be filed with the county clerk on December 31 each year for all such orders issued that year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Notwithstanding 1966 PA 293, MCL 45.501 to 45.521, a county operating under a home rule charter shall not be restricted by the provisions of the home rule charter in connection with the powers granted to the county treasurer to issue notes by this section. The treasurer of a county described in this subsection, notwithstanding any charter provisions to the contrary, shall have all of the powers granted to county treasurers by this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If the treasurer so authorizes in the order authorizing the notes, any notes issued may be secured in whole or in part under a trust or escrow agreement. That agreement may authorize the trustee or escrow agent to make investments of any type authorized in the agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Notes issued under this act are exempt from the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 20.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    If a borrower has outstanding any bonds issued under this act, it may issue and negotiate new bonds under this act for the purpose of providing for the retirement of those outstanding bonds, in whole or in part. The new bonds shall be designated "revenue refunding bonds". Except as otherwise provided in the refunding ordinance, revenue refunding bonds shall be secured to the same extent and shall have the same source of payment as the bonds to be refunded, or may be payable from earnings on investments held in trust to pay refunded bonds for the period of time specified in the ordinance authorizing the bonds or from any other source provided in the ordinance authorizing the refunding bonds. The revenue refunding bonds may be issued to include the amount of any premium to be paid upon the calling of the bonds to be refunded, interest to the maturity or the earliest or any subsequent redemption date of the bonds to be refunded, and the cost of issuing the refunding bonds, or if the bonds are not callable, any premium necessary to be paid in order to secure the surrender of the bonds to be refunded. This section shall not be construed as providing for the redemption of noncallable unmatured bonds without the consent of the holder or holders of the bonds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The borrower may issue bonds partly to refund outstanding bonds, which portion shall be considered a revenue refunding bond for purposes of this section, and partly for any other purpose contemplated by this act but which would not include loans for private mortgage purposes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Bonds issued to refund outstanding bonds and bonds issued partly to refund outstanding bonds and partly for any other purposes may be issued in a principal amount and may bear an interest rate that is greater than, the same as, or lower than the principal amount and interest rate of the bonds to be refunded. The refunding bonds and the bonds issued pursuant to subsection (2) may be sold as provided in section 12 or, to the extent the bond is issued to refund an outstanding bond, may be exchanged for the obligations to be refunded by the obligations, and if sold, the proceeds attributable to the purpose of refunding an outstanding obligation shall be deposited in a bank, trust company, savings and loan association, or credit union in a special trust account or escrow account to be used only for the payment at maturity or redemption or purchase of the outstanding bonds. If refunding bonds or bonds issued pursuant to subsection (2) are to be issued and sold for the sole or partial purpose of refunding unmatured noncallable bonds, the latter shall be surrendered and canceled at the time of the delivery to the purchaser of the refunding bonds, or the proceeds of the bonds attributable to the purpose of refunding an outstanding obligation and sufficient other funds shall be deposited in trust to pay principal and interest to maturity or principal, interest, and redemption premium to the earliest or any subsequent redemption date together with irrevocable instructions to the paying agent to call the bonds for redemption on that date. The borrower may deposit in trust direct obligations of, or obligations the principal and interest of which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States that do not permit redemption at the option of the issuer and the principal and interest on which when due, without reinvestment, provide funds sufficient to pay principal, interest, and call premium, when due, on the bonds being refunded.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 20b.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If a township, city, or village has outstanding bonds issued for acquiring or constructing public improvements, whether the bonds are payable from revenues, special assessments, or taxes, it may issue revenue bonds under this act for the purpose of retiring the outstanding bonds. If a city or village has issued refunding bonds, including in a single series, or bonds for 1 or more of the public improvements together with bonds for other purposes, the governing body may designate by number and amount the refunding bonds of the series that represent the original bonds issued for the public improvements and may refund the bonds designated by the issuance of revenue refunding bonds under this act. The revenue refunding bonds shall be valid notwithstanding a defect in the proceedings for the issuance of the bonds refunded or for the acquisition of the public improvement if, at the time of refunding, the public improvement can be acquired and revenue bonds can be issued for the improvement under this act. If this act applies to the issuance, the new bonds shall be authorized in the same manner, shall be subject to the same conditions, shall be secured to the same extent, and shall have the same source of payment as other bonds issued under this act for like improvements. The bonds may include the costs of issuing the bonds and the amount of the premium to be paid on the calling of the outstanding bonds, or if the bonds are not callable, the premium necessary to be paid to secure the surrender of the bonds. If revenue refunding bonds are to be issued, the amount due upon a bond to be refunded may be reduced by consent of the holder of the bond, and refunding bonds may be issued for the reduced amount. This section shall not be construed as providing for the redemption of noncallable unmatured bonds without the consent of the holder of the bond. The bonds may be exchanged for the outstanding bonds or may be sold as provided in section 12. If sold, the proceeds shall be deposited in a bank, trust company, savings and loan association, or credit union in a special trust account or escrow account to be used only for the redemption or purchase of the outstanding bonds. If refunding bonds are to be issued and sold for the purpose of refunding noncallable unmatured bonds, the noncallable unmatured bonds shall be surrendered and canceled at the time of the delivery to the purchaser of the refunding bonds, or sufficient funds deposited in trust to pay principal and interest to maturity on noncallable bonds and principal, interest, and redemption premium to the earliest redemption date on callable bonds together with irrevocable instructions to the paying agent to call the bonds for redemption on that date. If the ordinance authorizing the bonds to be refunded permits, the borrower may deposit in trust direct obligations of, or obligations the principal and interest of which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States that do not permit redemption at the option of the issuer and the principal and interest on which when due, without reinvestment, provide funds sufficient to pay principal, interest, and call premium, when due, on the bonds being refunded.</DIV>

The special assessment bonds may pledge the full faith and credit of the public corporation issuing them, as determined by the governing body of the public corporation. The special assessment bonds may be issued to include the amount of any premium to be paid upon the calling of the parking revenue bonds to be refunded or if such bonds are not callable, any premium necessary to be paid in order to secure the surrender of the bonds to be refunded; but the amount of the premium so included shall not exceed 5% of the principal amount of the bonds to be refunded.

</P>
<P>Sec. 21.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Rates for services furnished by a public improvement shall be fixed before the issuance of the bonds. The rates shall be sufficient to provide for all the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The payment of the expenses of administration and operation and the expenses for the maintenance of the public improvement as may be necessary to preserve the public improvement in good repair and working order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The payment of the interest on and the principal of bonds payable from the public improvements when the bonds become due and payable. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The creation of any reserve for the bonds as required in the ordinance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Other expenditures and funds for the public improvement as the ordinance may require.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The rates shall be fixed and revised by the governing body of the borrower so as to produce the amount described in subsection (1). The borrower shall covenant and agree in the ordinance authorizing the issuance of the bonds and on the face of each bond to maintain at all times the rates for services furnished by the public improvement sufficient to provide for the amount described in subsection (1). Rates pledged for the payment of bonds that are fixed and established pursuant to a contract or lease shall not be subject to revision or change, except in the manner provided in the lease or contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Charges for services furnished to a premises may be a lien on the premises, and those charges delinquent for 6 months or more may be certified annually to the proper tax assessing officer or agency who shall enter the lien on the next tax roll against the premises to which the services shall have been rendered, and the charges shall be collected and the lien shall be enforced in the same manner as provided for the collection of taxes assessed upon the roll and the enforcement of the lien for the taxes. The time and manner of certification and other details in respect to the collection of the charges and the enforcement of the lien shall be prescribed by the ordinance adopted by the governing body of the public corporation. However, in a case when a tenant is responsible for the payment of the charges and the governing body is so notified in writing, the notice to include a copy of the lease of the affected premises, if there is one, then the charges shall not become a lien against the premises after the date of the notice. In the event of filing of the notice, the public corporation shall render no further service to the premises until a cash deposit in a sum fixed in the ordinance authorizing the issuance of bonds under this act is made as security for the payment of the charges. In addition to any other lawful enforcement methods, the payment of charges for water service to any premises may be enforced by discontinuing the water service to the premises and the payment of charges for sewage disposal service or storm water disposal service to a premises may be enforced by discontinuing the water service, the sewage disposal service, or the storm water disposal service to the premises, or any combination of the services. The inclusion of these methods of enforcing the payment of charges in an ordinance adopted before February 26, 1974, is validated.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In the authorizing ordinance the governing body of the borrower shall provide that the revenues of the public improvement be accounted for separately from the other funds and accounts of the borrower in the following order of recorded priority:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   After provision for the payment for the next succeeding period of all current expenses of administration and operation and the current expenses for that period for maintenance as may be necessary to preserve the public improvement in good repair and working order. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   There shall be next set aside a sum sufficient to provide for the payment of the principal of and the interest upon all bonds payable from those revenues, as and when the bonds become due and payable. This account shall be designated "bond and interest redemption account". In the event that the revenues of any operating year over and above those necessary for the operation and maintenance expenses shall be insufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds maturing in any operating year, then an additional amount sufficient to pay the principal and interest shall be set aside out of the revenues of the next succeeding operating year, after provision for the expenses of operation and maintenance. In respect to the allocation and use of money in the bond and interest redemption account, due recognition shall be given as to priority rights, if any, between different issues or series of outstanding bonds. The public corporation may provide by ordinance that a reasonable excess amount shall be set aside in the bond and interest redemption account from time to time so as to produce and provide a reserve to meet any possible future deficiencies. </DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided by law, the legislative body of a local unit may provide by resolution for the acquisition or financing of energy conservation improvements to be made to facilities or infrastructure owned or operated by the local unit and may pay for the improvements or the financing or refunding of the improvements from the general fund of the local unit or from the savings that result from the energy conservation improvements. Energy conservation improvements may include, but are not limited to, heating, ventilating, or air-conditioning system improvements, fenestration improvements, roof improvements, the installation of any insulation, the installation or repair of heating, ventilating, or air-conditioning controls, entrance or exit way closures, information technology improvements associated with an energy conservation improvement, and municipal utility improvements associated with an energy conservation improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The legislative body of a local unit may acquire, finance, or refund 1 or more of the energy conservation improvements described in subsection (1) by installment contract, which may include a lease-purchase agreement described in subsection (5), or may borrow money and issue notes for the purpose of securing funds for the improvements or may enter into contracts in which the cost of the energy conservation improvements is paid from a portion of the savings that result from the energy conservation improvements. These contractual agreements may provide that the cost of the energy conservation improvements are paid only if the energy savings are sufficient to cover their cost. An installment contract, a lease-purchase agreement described in subsection (5), or notes issued pursuant to this subsection shall extend for a period of time not to exceed 20 years from the date of the final completion of the energy conservation improvements or the useful life of the aggregate energy conservation improvements, whichever is less. Notes issued pursuant to this subsection shall be limited full faith and credit, tax limited obligations of the local unit, payable from tax levies and the general fund as pledged by the legislative body of the local unit. The notes shall be subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821. A lease-purchase agreement issued pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821, and shall not be a municipal security or a debt as those terms are defined in that act. This subsection does not limit in any manner the borrowing or bonding authority of a local unit as provided by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Prior to entering into a contract for energy conservation improvements under this section, the legislative body of a local unit shall determine the following information and, within 60 days of the completion of the improvements, shall report the following information to the Michigan public service commission: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Name of each facility to which an improvement is made and a description of the energy conservation improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Actual energy consumption during the 12-month period before commencement of the improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Project costs and expenditures, including the total of all lease payments over the duration of the lease-purchase agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Estimated annual energy savings, including projected savings over the duration of the installment contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If energy conservation improvements are made as provided in this section, the legislative body of a local unit shall report to the Michigan public service commission, by July 1 of each of the 5 years after the improvements are completed, only the actual annual energy consumption of each facility to which improvements are made. The forms for the reports required by this section shall be furnished by the Michigan public service commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An installment contract described in this section may include a lease-purchase agreement, which may be a multiyear contractual obligation that provides for automatic renewal unless positive action is taken by the legislative body to terminate that contract. Payments under a lease-purchase agreement shall be a current operating expense subject to annual appropriations of funds by the legislative body and shall obligate the legislative body only for those sums payable during the fiscal year of contract execution or any renewal year thereafter. The legislative body may make payments under a lease-purchase agreement from any legally available funds or from a combination of energy or operational savings, capital contributions, future replacement costs avoided, or billable revenue enhancements that result from energy conservation improvements, provided that the legislative body has determined that those funds are sufficient to cover, in aggregate over the full term of the contractual agreement, the cost of the energy conservation improvements. The lease-purchase agreement will terminate immediately and absolutely and without further obligation on the part of the legislative body at the close of the fiscal year in which it was executed or renewed or at such time as appropriated and otherwise unobligated funds are no longer available to satisfy the obligations of the legislative body under the lease-purchase agreement. During the term of the lease-purchase agreement, the legislative body shall be the vested owner of the energy conservation improvements and may grant a security interest in the energy conservation improvements to the provider of the lease-purchase agreement. Upon the termination of the lease-purchase agreement and the satisfaction of the obligations of the legislative body, the provider of the lease-purchase agreement shall release its security interest in the energy conservation improvements.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The state treasurer shall cause to be distributed from the health and safety fund the following amounts in the 1988-89 fiscal year and in each following fiscal year: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) One-fourth of the collections deposited in the fund under section 3(2) shall be used for indigent volume adjusters for hospitals within the medicaid program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) After the distribution in subdivision (a), $16,000,000.00 of the amount deposited in the fund under section 3(2) shall be distributed as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (iii), to a county that received a loan authorized under section 3(2) or (3) of the emergency municipal loan act, 1980 PA 243, MCL 141.933, to pay outstanding obligations of the county; for the repayment of principal and interest on any loans made to the county under the emergency municipal loan act, 1980 PA 243, MCL 141.931 to 141.942; and for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest due during a fiscal year on bonds issued by that county under the fiscal stabilization act, 1981 PA 80, MCL 141.1001 to 141.1011.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Except as provided in subparagraph (iii), to the extent that $16,000,000.00 is no longer necessary to satisfy the obligations under subparagraph (i), a portion of the amount not required for satisfaction of obligations shall be distributed to each county that receives or has received a loan authorized under section 3(2) or (3) of the emergency municipal loan act, 1980 PA 243, MCL 141.933, in an amount determined by multiplying the amount available for distribution under this subparagraph by a fraction, the numerator of which is the population of the county receiving the distribution and the denominator of which is the total population of the state according to the most recent decennial census. The distribution under this subparagraph shall be made at the same times and shall be used, subject to section 6, for the same purposes described in subdivision (c). The remaining amount available for distribution under this subparagraph shall be used on a per capita basis to offset the cost to the state of the assumption of the financing of the state court system in the counties not receiving a distribution under this subparagraph.</div>

A distribution under this subdivision shall be made each February, May, August, and November from the collections that were deposited in the fund under section 3(2) in the immediately preceding calendar quarter. Subject to section 6, 12/17 of the distribution under this subdivision shall be distributed to each local health department as defined in section 1105 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.1105, in the county receiving the distribution on a per capita basis, based on the most recent decennial census, to be used only for public health prevention programs and services. This distribution is in addition to and is not intended as a replacement for any other state or county payments to these health departments. This distribution satisfies the requirements of former section 7a(3) of 1947 PA 265. The remaining 5/17 of the distribution shall be used only for 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The operation, maintenance, or expansion of an existing county jail facility or juvenile facility. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The governing body of a city, by a lawfully adopted ordinance that incorporates by reference the uniform city income tax ordinance set forth in chapter 2, may levy, assess, and collect an excise tax on income as provided in the ordinance. The ordinance shall state the rate of the tax which shall be the rate authorized by 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The uniform city income tax ordinance under section 11 of chapter 2.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Section 3a, 3b, or 3c of this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In a city with a population of more than 600,000, the governing body may levy and collect a tax at a rate to be determined from time to time, that rate to be not more than 2% on corporations and the following maximum tax rates on resident individuals and nonresident individuals for the following years:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Before July 1, 1999, 3.00% on resident individuals and 1.50% on nonresident individuals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Beginning July 1, 1999 and each July 1 after 1999 through July 1, 2012, except for 2008 and 2009, the maximum tax rate under this subsection on resident individuals shall be reduced by 0.1 until the rate on resident individuals is 2.0%. The tax rate imposed on nonresident individuals shall be 50% of the tax rate imposed on resident individuals each year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for the 2008 and 2009 calendar years, the city shall impose the same tax rate on resident individuals and nonresident individuals as the city had imposed for the 2007 calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Except as otherwise provided under subdivision (e), beginning January 1, 2013 and each year after 2013, a rate of not more than 2.40% on resident individuals and 1.20% on nonresident individuals. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Beginning January 1 of the year immediately succeeding the year that all bonds, obligations, and other evidence of indebtedness issued by a lighting authority have been fully paid and each year thereafter, a rate of not more than 2.20% on resident individuals and 1.10% on nonresident individuals. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any ordinance of the city to the contrary, a city that forms a lighting authority shall deposit an amount equal to the sum of the revenue collected from 0.2% of the rate levied on resident individuals pursuant to subsection (2)(d) and 0.1% of the rate levied on nonresident individuals pursuant to subsection (2)(d) directly into the budget of the city's police department and use it exclusively to retain or hire police officers. The transfer and use of the revenue as provided under this subsection shall continue until all bonds, obligations, or other evidence of indebtedness issued by a lighting authority have been fully paid and revenue is no longer being pledged from taxes levied under the city utility users tax act, 1990 PA 100, MCL 141.1151 to 141.1177, to the lighting authority. As used in this subsection, "lighting authority" means a lighting authority incorporated under the municipal lighting authority act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The governing body of a city may adopt the uniform city income tax ordinance with the alternative sections as set forth in chapter 3 instead of the similarly numbered sections as set forth in chapter 2. The uniform city income tax ordinance may be lawfully adopted or rescinded by the governing body at any time. The adoption of an ordinance is effective on and after January 1 or July 1 following adoption of the ordinance, as specified in the ordinance, but an ordinance shall not become effective earlier than 45 days after adoption or until approved by the electors if a referendum petition is filed as authorized in this act or a referendum is otherwise required. The rescission of an ordinance shall become effective on the following December 31. The ordinance may be rescinded at any time by the governing body in the same manner in which it was adopted and with appropriate enforcement, collection, and refund provisions with respect to liabilities incurred prior to the effective date of the rescission of the ordinance. The ordinance shall not be amended except as provided by the legislature. A city may amend the ordinance to change the tax rate to a rate authorized by this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Petitions for a referendum election on the question of adopting an ordinance adopted by the governing body may be filed with the city clerk not later than the sixth Monday following the adoption of the ordinance. The petitions shall be signed by a number of registered electors of the city equal to at least 10%, but not more than 20%, of the registered electors of the city voting in the last general municipal election prior to the adoption of the ordinance by the governing body. If proper petitions are filed, the question of adopting the ordinance shall be submitted by the governing body to the city electors at the next primary or general election or at a special election called for the purpose, in any case held not less than 45 days nor more than 90 days after the clerk has reported the filing of the referendum petition to the city's governing body. The checking of names on the petitions, the counting, canvassing, and return of the votes on the question, and other procedures for the election shall be as provided by law or charter. Upon a favorable vote of the city electors, the ordinance shall be effective as specified in the ordinance which may be amended by the governing body of the city following the election to specify July 1 or January 1 as the effective date of the ordinance, if the effective date originally specified in the ordinance is considered impractical or inconvenient for any reason. The provisions in this section for a referendum election, and for delaying the effective date of the ordinance if petitions for a referendum are filed, are not applicable to a city that on January 1, 1964 had in effect a valid ordinance levying and imposing an excise tax levied on or measured by income. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, if an ordinance becomes effective on any date other than January 1, each tax year shall end on December 31, and the provisions of the ordinance based on a full tax year are modified accordingly to be applicable to the partial tax year.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 25.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   An alternative method of accounting shall be used if the taxpayer or the administrator demonstrates that the net profits of the taxpayer allocable to the city cannot be justly and equitably determined under the separate accounting method or the business allocation percentage method, or if undue expense to the taxpayer would result from complying therewith because of the taxpayer's manner of operations and methods of accounting. In such case the administrator, upon application of the taxpayer or upon his own initiative, may approve or specify factors or methods of determination as will effect a just, nondiscriminatory and reasonable result. Application to the administrator to substitute other factors in the formula or to use a different method to allocate net profits shall be made in writing and state the specific grounds on which the substitution of factors or use of a different method is requested and the relief sought. No specific form need be followed in making the application. Once a taxpayer has filed under a substitute method, he shall continue so to file until given permission by the administrator to change.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 26.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Capital gains and capital losses, other than gains and losses on securities issued by the government of the United States, shall be included in income only to the extent of that portion of the gains or losses which occur after the effective date of this ordinance. In determining the amount of gain or loss, the taxpayer may use net proceeds from the sale or exchange less fair market value as of the effective date of this ordinance. The fair market value of property shall be determined by an appraisal or similar reliable evidence. The fair market value of a security shall be the last quoted price on the last business day prior to the effective date. For a security traded over the counter the last quoted price shall be the last bid price on the last business day prior to the effective date. The taxpayer may determine the gain or loss on a transaction in the same manner as for federal income tax purposes taking into account only that portion thereof which occurs after the effective date. The portion of that gain or loss includible in computing taxable income will be the same proportion of the total gain or loss as the period of time the property was held after the effective date of the ordinance bears to the total time the property was held. In any city adopting this ordinance which had a valid local income tax ordinance in effect on January 1, 1964, capital gains and losses shall be included to the extent of that portion of such gains or losses which occur after the effective date of the original city income tax ordinance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If capital losses exceed capital gains in a taxable year, the unused portion may be utilized to the same extent and on the same basis as under the federal internal revenue code.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   An estate or trust is not subject to tax under this ordinance, except that it shall be treated as a nonresident individual for purposes of section 11 of this ordinance to the extent income of the estate or trust described in section 13 is not includible in the return of a resident individual as "income from estates and trusts". A resident individual shall include "income from estates and trusts" in his income subject to tax under this ordinance without regard to the situs of the estate or trust.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    "Income from estates" means "income" as defined in section 643 (b) of the federal internal revenue code, properly paid, credited or distributed but not in excess of the resident individual's share of the distributable net income of the estate decreased by the amount of depreciation or depletion allowed the resident individual as a deduction under section 642 of the federal internal revenue code. The exceptions hereinafter set forth with respect to trusts are also applicable to income from estates. "Income from trusts" means the amount of "income" as defined in section 643 (b) of the federal internal revenue code, distributed or required to be distributed under sections 652 (a) or 662 (a) (1) of the federal internal revenue code, decreased by the amount of depreciation or depletion allowed the resident individual as a deduction by section 642 of the federal internal revenue code, with the following exceptions: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Dividends on stock of state and national banks and trust companies.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Interest from obligations of the United States, the states or subordinate units of government of the states.</DIV>

With respect to trusts where the income is taxed to the grantor or some other person under subpart E of subchapter J of the federal internal revenue code, the grantor or other person shall include in his return all items of income and deductions allowed by this ordinance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   An individual shall include "income from estates and trusts" in his return in the same year as provided in the federal internal revenue code with respect to distributions of income from estates and trusts. The amount of income included in the return for the first tax year of a resident individual, with respect to estates and trusts, shall be computed as though the tax year of the estate or trust for federal income tax purposes began on the effective date of this ordinance and ended with the end of the tax year of the estate or trust for federal income tax purposes which ends next following the effective date.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Upon passage of a further ordinance, a city, as determined by its governing body, may provide for either an exemption from the tax levied under this act if that person's adjusted gross income for that tax year is less than a certain amount to be as specified by the ordinance, or an exemption in an amount to be specified by the ordinance, for a person with respect to whom a deduction under part 1 of the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.1 to 206.532 is allowable to another taxpayer during the tax year and is therefore not considered to have a personal exemption under subsection (1).</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 35.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance and to the extent and for the duration provided in the Michigan renaissance zone act, Act No. 376 of the Public Acts of 1996, being sections 125.2681 to 125.2696 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, for the 1997 tax year and each tax year after 1997, a qualified taxpayer may deduct from gross income in determining income subject to tax under this ordinance, to the extent a deduction is applicable to income subject to the tax under this ordinance, an amount equal to 1 of the following for the specified types of taxpayers:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   For a qualified taxpayer as defined in subsection (12)(c)(i):</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   (i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii), income subject to the tax that is earned or received in the tax year during the period of time that the taxpayer was a qualified taxpayer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   (ii) Capital gains subject to the tax that are received during the tax year during the period of time that the taxpayer was a qualified taxpayer. The deduction allowed under this subdivision shall be prorated based on the percentage of time that the asset was held by the taxpayer while the taxpayer was a qualified taxpayer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   (iii) Income received by the qualified taxpayer from winning an on-line lottery game sponsored by this state but only if the date on which the drawing for that game was held is after the taxpayer became a qualified taxpayer of a renaissance zone and income received by the taxpayer from winning an instant lottery game sponsored by this state but only if the taxpayer was a qualified taxpayer of a renaissance zone on the validation date of the lottery ticket for that game.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   For a qualified taxpayer as defined in subsection (12)(c)(ii), the amount determined pursuant to section 14, 19, 20 to 24, or 25 of this ordinance multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the percentage that the average net book value of the tangible personal property owned and the real property, including leasehold improvements, owned or used by the qualified taxpayer in the business and situated within the renaissance zone during the taxable period, is of the average net book value of all such property, including leasehold improvements, owned or used by the taxpayer in the business during the same period situated in the city plus the percentage that the total compensation paid to employees for work done or for services performed within the renaissance zone is of the total compensation paid to all the taxpayer's employees within the city during the period covered by the return and the denominator of which is 2. For allocation purposes, compensation shall be computed on the cash or accrual basis in accordance with the method used in computing the entire net income of the taxpayer. Real property includes real property rented or leased by the qualified taxpayer and the value of that property is considered to be 8 times the annual gross rental on the property. "Gross rental on the property" means gross rental of real property as that term is defined in section 21 of this ordinance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   For a qualified taxpayer as defined in subsection (12)(c)(iii), the amount determined pursuant to section 15 of this ordinance multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the percentage that the average net book value of the tangible personal property owned and the real property, including leasehold improvements, owned or used by the qualified taxpayer in the business and situated within the renaissance zone during the taxable period, is of the average net book value of all such property, including leasehold improvements, owned or used by the taxpayer in the business during the same period situated in the city plus the percentage that the total compensation paid to employees for work done or for services performed within the renaissance zone is of the total compensation paid to all the taxpayer's employees within the city during the period covered by the return and the denominator of which is 2. For allocation purposes, compensation shall be computed on the cash or accrual basis in accordance with the method used in computing the entire net income of the taxpayer. Real property includes real property rented or leased by the qualified taxpayer and the value of that property is considered to be 8 times the annual gross rental on the property. "Gross rental on the property" means gross rental of real property as that term is defined in section 21 of this ordinance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For a qualified taxpayer as defined in subsections (12)(c)(ii) and (iii), any portion of income subject to tax under this ordinance derived from illegal activity conducted in a renaissance zone shall not be used to calculate a deduction allowed under this section. For a qualified taxpayer who is an individual, any portion of income subject to tax under this ordinance derived from illegal activity conducted anywhere shall not be used to calculate the deduction allowed under this section. For a qualified taxpayer as defined in subsection (12)(c)(ii) and (iii), any portion of the taxpayer's tax liability that is attributable to business activity related to the operation of a casino, and business activity that is associated or affiliated with the operation of a casino including, but not limited to, the operation of a parking lot, hotel, motel, or retail store, shall not be used to calculate a credit under this section. As used in this subsection, "casino" means a casino regulated by this state pursuant to the Michigan gaming control and revenue act, Initiated Law of 1996, being sections 432.201 to 432.216 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a qualified taxpayer completes the residency requirements under subsection (12)(c) before the end of the tax year in which the qualified taxpayer first resided in the renaissance zone, the qualified taxpayer may claim the deduction allowed under this section for that tax year. If the qualified taxpayer completes the residency requirements under subsection (12)(c) in a tax year subsequent to the tax year in which the qualified taxpayer first resided in the renaissance zone, the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the qualified taxpayer completes the residency requirement in a tax year subsequent to the tax year in which the taxpayer first resided in the renaissance zone and before the date for filing the annual return under this ordinance for the tax year in which the taxpayer first resided in the renaissance zone, the taxpayer may claim the deduction allowed under this section for the tax year in which the taxpayer first resided in the renaissance zone.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the qualified taxpayer completes the residency requirement in a tax year subsequent to the tax year in which the taxpayer first resided in the renaissance zone and after the date for filing the annual return under this ordinance for the tax year in which the taxpayer first resided in the renaissance zone, the qualified taxpayer may claim the deduction allowed under this section for the tax year in which the residency requirement is completed on the annual return for the tax year in which the residency requirement is completed and may claim the deduction for the tax year in which the qualified taxpayer first resided in the renaissance zone by filing an amended return for that tax year in which the qualified taxpayer first resided in the renaissance zone.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   To be eligible for the deduction under this section, a taxpayer shall file an annual return under this ordinance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A qualified taxpayer shall file a withholding form prescribed by the city with his or her employer after the date the qualified taxpayer completes the requirements under subsection (12)(c) or, at the option of the city, for taxpayers who claim to be qualified taxpayers under subsection (12)(c)(i), the taxpayer shall file a form prescribed by the city with the city after the date the taxpayer completes the requirements under subsection (12)(c)(i). If the city verifies the information on the form, the city shall issue a certificate of qualification to the taxpayer which the taxpayer shall file with his or her employer. When a taxpayer who filed a form under this subsection is no longer a qualified taxpayer under subsection (12)(c)(i), the taxpayer shall send a written notice of that change in status to the city not more than 10 days after the change in status occurs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If the administrator finds that a taxpayer has claimed a deduction under this section to which he or she is not entitled, the taxpayer is subject to the interest and penalty provisions under this ordinance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The deduction allowed under this section continues through the tax year in which the renaissance zone designation expires.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   A net operating loss deduction allowed under this ordinance shall be calculated without regard to any deduction allowed under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   If a taxpayer who was a qualified taxpayer during the tax year changes status and is not a qualified taxpayer or vice versa, income subject to tax under this ordinance shall be determined separately for income in each status.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   A qualified taxpayer as defined in subsection (12)(c)(i) is a resident of a renaissance zone for purposes of Act No. 376 of the Public Acts of 1996.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   "Qualified taxpayer" means 1 of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   (i) A taxpayer who is an individual, a resident of the city as determined under this ordinance, and is domiciled in an area of the city that is designated a renaissance zone for a period of 183 consecutive days. A taxpayer may begin calculating the 183-day period during the 183 days immediately preceding the designation of the area as a renaissance zone. Qualified taxpayer under this subparagraph includes the estate of an individual who was a qualified taxpayer at the time of death. After a taxpayer has completed the 183-day requirement under this subparagraph, the taxpayer is considered to have been a qualified taxpayer of that renaissance zone beginning from the first day used to determine if the 183-day requirement has been met.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   (ii) A taxpayer that is a corporation and that is located and conducts business activity in a renaissance zone in the city.  (iii) A person who is located in and conducts business activity as an unincorporated business, profession, or other activity in a renaissance zone and is not a qualified taxpayer under subparagraph (i) or (ii).</DIV>

<P>Sec. 43.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    A balance of the tax that is due the city at the time of filing an annual return shall be paid with the return unless the balance is less than $1.00, in which case payment is not required.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the annual return reflects an overpayment of the tax, the declaration of the overpayment on the return constitutes a claim for refund. Subject to subsection (6), if the city or the department agrees that a claim is valid, the city or the department shall apply the overpayment first to a delinquent tax liability under this ordinance of the taxpayer to the city. The city shall apply any remaining overpayment against a subsequent liability under this ordinance or, at the election of the taxpayer and if indicated on the return, shall refund the overpayment. However, the city shall not pay a refund of less than $1.00.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a valid claim for a refund of taxes, except a refund under section 61, due for the taxable year 1992 or a taxable year after 1992 is filed, interest at the rate established in section 30(3) of Act No. 122 of the Public Acts of 1941, being section 205.30 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, shall be added to the refund beginning 45 days after the claim is filed or 45 days after the date established under this ordinance for the filing of the return, whichever is later. For tax years after the 1996 tax year and for which a city has entered into an agreement pursuant to section 9 of chapter 1, a claim for refund shall be paid from money in the city income tax trust fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   For tax years after the 1995 tax year and for which a city has entered into an agreement pursuant to section 9 of chapter 1, if a taxpayer pays, when filing his or her annual return, an amount less than the sum of the declared tax liability under this act, and the declared tax liability under the income tax act of 1967, Act No. 281 of the Public Acts of 1967, being sections 206.1 to 206.532 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, and there is no indication of the allocation of payment between the tax liabilities against which the payment should be applied, the amount paid shall first be applied against the taxpayer's tax liability under this act and any remaining amount of payment shall be applied to the taxpayer's tax liability under Act No. 281 of the Public Acts of 1967. The taxpayer's designation of a payee on a payment is not a dispositive determination of the allocation of that payment under this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the claim for refund is reflected on a joint tax return, the administrator shall allocate to each joint taxpayer his or her share of the refund. The amount allocated to each taxpayer shall be applied to his or her respective liabilities under this ordinance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If the administrator or the department determines that all or a portion of a refund claimed on a joint tax return is subject to application to a liability of an obligated spouse, the administrator or the department shall notify the joint taxpayers by first class mail sent to the address shown on the joint return. The notice shall be accompanied by a nonobligated spouse allocation form. The notice shall state all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That all or a portion of the refund claimed by the joint taxpayers is subject to interception to satisfy a liability or liabilities of 1 or both spouses.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The nature of the liability and the name of the obligated spouse or spouses.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   That a nonobligated spouse may claim his or her share of the refund by filing a nonobligated spouse allocation form with the city or the department not more than 30 days after the date the notice was mailed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A statement of the penalties under subsection (9).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A nonobligated spouse who wishes to claim his or her share of a tax refund shall file with the city or the department a nonobligated spouse allocation form. The nonobligated spouse allocation form shall be in a form specified by the administrator or the department and shall require the spouses to state the amount of income or other tax base and all adjustments to the income or other tax base, including all subtractions, additions, deductions, credits, and exemptions, stated on the joint tax return that is the basis for the claimed refund, and an allocation of those amounts between the obligated and nonobligated spouse. In allocating these amounts, all of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Individual income shall be allocated to the spouse who earned the income. Joint income shall be allocated equally between the spouses.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Each spouse shall be allocated the personal exemptions he or she would be entitled to claim if separate federal returns had been filed, except that dependency exemptions shall be prorated according to the relative income of the spouses. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Adjustments resulting from a business shall be allocated to the spouse who claimed income from the business.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Ownership of other assets relevant to the allocation shall be disclosed upon request of the administrator or the department.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   A nonobligated spouse allocation form shall be signed by both joint taxpayers. However, the form may be submitted without the signature of the obligated spouse if his or her signature cannot be obtained. The nonobligated spouse shall certify that he or she has made a good faith effort to obtain the signature of the obligated spouse and shall state the reason that the signature was not obtained.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   A person who knowingly makes a false statement on a nonobligated spouse allocation form is subject to a penalty of $25.00 or 25% of the excessive claim for his or her share of the refund, whichever is greater, and other penalties as provided in this ordinance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   A nonobligated spouse to whom the administrator or the department has sent a notice under subsection (6), who fails to file a nonobligated spouse allocation form within 30 days after the date the notice was mailed, shall be barred from commencing any action against the city or the department to recover an amount withheld to satisfy a liability of the obligated spouse to which a joint tax refund is applied under this section. The payment by the city or the department of any amount applied to a liability of a taxpayer under this section shall release the department or the city and the administrator from all liability to the obligated spouse, the nonobligated spouse, and any other person having or claiming any interest in the amount paid. A payment by the department of treasury under this subsection shall be made from the city income tax trust fund created in section 5 of chapter 1.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   As used in this section:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Nonobligated spouse" means a person who has filed a joint city income tax return and who is not liable for an obligation of his or her spouse described in this ordinance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Obligated spouse" means a person who has filed a joint city income tax return and who is liable for an obligation described in this ordinance for which his or her spouse is not liable.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) At a rate equal to the difference in the percentage rate of tax on resident individuals as set by ordinance to be levied under this ordinance less the percentage rate of tax levied by any other city in which the employee works, on all compensation earned by the resident in another city.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The filing of a declaration of estimated tax does not excuse the taxpayer from filing an annual return even though there is no change in the declared tax liability. An annual return shall be filed with the city by the end of the fourth month or for tax years after the 1996 tax year and for which a city has entered into an agreement pursuant to section 9 of chapter 1, filed with the department on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year following that for which the declaration was filed. Upon written request of a taxpayer the administrator or the department may extend the time for filing the annual return for not to exceed 6 months. The administrator or the department may require a tentative return and payment of the estimated tax.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A penalty or interest shall not be assessed if the return is filed and the final tax paid within the extended time and all other filing and payment requirements of this ordinance are satisfied, and the estimated tax paid equals 70% or more of the tax shown due on the final return or 70% or more of the tax shown due on the taxpayer's return for the immediately preceding taxable year.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 64a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    If a person liable for the tax imposed under this ordinance sells a business or the stock of goods of a business or quits a business, the person shall make a final return to the city or the department within 15 days after the date the business or stock of goods is sold or the person quits the business. The purchaser or succeeding purchasers, if any, who purchase a going or closed business or stock of goods of a going or closed business shall escrow sufficient money to cover the amount of taxes, interest, and penalties that may be due and unpaid until the former owner produces a receipt from the administrator that shows that the taxes due have been paid, or a certificate that states that taxes are not due. If the owner provides a written waiver of confidentiality, the administrator may release to a purchaser a business's known tax liability for the purposes of establishing an escrow account for the payment of taxes. If the purchaser or succeeding purchasers of a business or stock of goods of a business fail to comply with the escrow requirements of this subsection, the purchaser is personally liable for the payment of the taxes, interest, and penalties accrued and unpaid by the business of the former owner. The purchaser's or succeeding purchaser's personal liability is limited to the fair market value of the business less the amount of any proceeds applied to balances due on secured interests that are superior to any lien provided for in this ordinance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a corporation that is liable for the tax imposed under this ordinance fails for any reason to file the required returns or to pay the tax due, any officers of the corporation that have control or supervision of, or who are charged with the responsibility for, making the returns or payments are personally liable for the failure to file or pay. The signature of any corporate officer on a return or negotiable instrument submitted in payment of a tax is prima facie evidence of the officer's responsibility for making the returns and payments. The dissolution of a corporation does not discharge an officer's liability for a prior failure of the corporation to make a return or remit a tax due. The sum due for a liability may be assessed and collected under this ordinance.</DIV>

The administrator or the department may examine the books, papers, and records of any person, employer, taxpayer, or agent or representative of any person, employer, or taxpayer or audit the accounts of any person, employer, or taxpayer or any other records pertaining to the tax, to verify the accuracy and completeness of a return filed, or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax, withholding, penalties, or interest due under this ordinance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The administrator or the department may examine any person, under oath, concerning income which was or should have been reported for taxation under this ordinance, and for this purpose may compel the production of books, papers, and records and the attendance of all parties before him or her, whether as parties or witnesses, if he or she believes those persons have knowledge of the income. For a city that has entered into an agreement with the department pursuant to section 9 of chapter 1, all of the following apply to implement this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The department shall send to the taxpayer or employer a letter of inquiry stating, in a courteous and unintimidating manner, the department's opinion that the taxpayer or employer needs to furnish further information or owes taxes to the city, and the reason for that opinion. A letter of inquiry shall also explain the procedure by which the taxpayer or employer may initiate communication with the department to resolve any dispute. A letter of inquiry may be served on the taxpayer in any manner determined appropriate by the department. This subdivision does not apply in any of the following circumstances: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The taxpayer or employer files a return that shows a tax due and fails to pay that tax.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The deficiency resulted from an audit of the taxpayer's or employer's books and records by the city or the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The taxpayer or employer otherwise affirmatively admits that a tax is due and owing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days after the department sends the taxpayer or employer a letter of inquiry or if a letter of inquiry is not required under subdivision (a), the department, after determining the amount of tax due from a taxpayer or employer, shall give notice to the taxpayer or employer of the department's notice of intent to assess the tax.

<P>Sec. 82.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    All taxes imposed in a taxable year before the 1992 taxable year on a taxpayer and money withheld by an employer under this ordinance and remaining unpaid after the taxes or money withheld are due bear interest from the due date at the rate of 1/2 of 1% per month until paid. For the 1992 taxable year and each subsequent taxable year before the 1997 taxable year, all taxes imposed on a taxpayer and money withheld by an employer under this ordinance and remaining unpaid after the taxes or money withheld are due bear interest from the due date at the current monthly rate of 1 percentage point above the adjusted prime rate per annum per month until the tax or money is paid. For taxable years after the 1996 taxable year, if the amount of a tax paid is less than the amount that should have been paid or an excessive claim for credit has been made, the deficiency and interest on the deficiency at the current monthly interest rate of 1 percentage point above the adjusted prime rate per annum from the time the tax was due, and until paid, are due and payable after a final assessment as provided in section 85. A deficiency in an estimated payment required by this ordinance shall be treated in the same manner as a tax due and is subject to the same current monthly interest rate of 1 percentage point above the adjusted prime rate per annum from the time the payment was due, until paid. The term "adjusted prime rate" means the average predominant prime rate quoted by not less than 3 commercial banks to large businesses, as determined by the department of treasury. For tax years before the 1997 tax year, the adjusted prime rate is to be based on the average prime rate charged by not less than 3 commercial banks during the 12-month period ending on September 30. One percentage point shall be added to the adjusted prime rate, and the resulting sum shall be divided by 12 to establish the current monthly interest rate. The resulting current monthly interest rate based on the 12-month period ending September 30 becomes effective on January 1 of the following year. For tax years after the 1996 tax year, "adjusted prime rate" means that term as defined in and determined under section 23(2) of Act No. 122 of the Public Acts of 1941, being section 205.23 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A person who fails to file a return, pay the tax, or remit withholding, when due, is liable, in addition to the interest, to a penalty of 1% of the amount of the unpaid tax for each month or fraction of a month, not to exceed a total penalty of 25% of the unpaid tax. If a return is filed or remittance is paid after the time specified and it is shown to the satisfaction of the city or the department that the failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the penalty shall be waived by the administrator or the department. If the total interest or interest and penalty to be assessed is less than $2.00, the administrator or the department shall instead assess $2.00.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as provided in subsection (4), if any part of the deficiency or an excessive claim for credit is due to negligence, but without intent to defraud, a penalty of $10.00 or 10% of the total amount of the deficiency in the tax, whichever is greater, plus interest as provided in subsection (1), shall be added. The penalty becomes due and payable after a final assessment is issued as provided in section 85. If a taxpayer subject to a penalty under this subsection demonstrates to the satisfaction of the administrator or the department that the deficiency or excess claim for credit was due to reasonable cause, the administrator or the department shall waive the penalty.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If any part of the deficiency or an excessive claim for credit is due to intentional disregard of this ordinance, but without intent to defraud, a penalty of $25.00 or 25% of the total amount of the deficiency in the tax, whichever is greater, plus interest as provided in subsection (1), shall be added. The penalty becomes due and payable after a final assessment is issued as provided in section 85. If a penalty is imposed under this subsection and the taxpayer subject to the penalty successfully disputes the penalty, the administrator or the department shall not impose a penalty prescribed by subsection (3) to the tax otherwise due.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If any part of the deficiency or an excessive claim for credit is due to fraudulent intent to evade the tax imposed under this ordinance, or to obtain a refund for a fraudulent claim, a penalty of 100% of the deficiency, plus interest as provided in subsection (1), shall be added. The penalty becomes due and payable after a final assessment is issued as provided in section 85 .</DIV>

For a city that has entered into an agreement with the department pursuant to section 9 of chapter 1, a taxpayer or employer who serves written notice upon the department within 60 days of the issuance of a credit audit or a refund denial is entitled to an informal conference in the same manner as required for a notice of intent to assess under this subsection. Except as otherwise provided under this chapter, upon request, the department shall conduct the informal conference in accordance with section 21 of 1941 PA 122, MCL 205.21. A taxpayer or employer must not file an appeal under section 92a unless an informal conference has been requested and conducted as required by this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a protest to the proposed assessment or notice of intent to assess the tax filed under this section is determined by the administrator or the department, whichever is applicable, to be a frivolous protest or a desire by the taxpayer or employer to delay or impede the administration of the tax under this ordinance, a penalty of $25.00 or 25% of the amount of tax under protest, whichever is greater, shall be added to the tax.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Notwithstanding section 86, a city that has entered into an agreement with the department pursuant to section 9 of chapter 1 may recover the tax with interest and penalties without a judgment or order from a court of competent jurisdiction by imposing a lien as provided under this section. A lien imposed pursuant to this section is a lien in favor of the city against all property and rights of property, both real and personal, tangible and intangible, owned at the time the lien attaches, or afterwards acquired by any person liable for the tax, to secure the payment of the tax. The lien shall attach to the property from and after the date that any report or return on which the tax is levied is required to be filed and shall continue for 7 years after the date of attachment. The lien may be extended for another 7 years by refiling under subsection (2) if the refiling is done within 6 months prior to the expiration date of the original 7-year period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The lien imposed by this section shall take precedence over all other liens and encumbrances, except bona fide liens recorded before the date the lien under this ordinance is recorded. However, bona fide liens recorded before the lien under this ordinance is recorded shall take precedence only to the extent of disbursements made under a financing arrangement before the forty-sixth day after the date of the tax lien recording or before the person making the disbursements had actual knowledge of a tax lien recording under this ordinance, whichever is earlier. A lien shall be recorded and discharged in the same manner required for a state tax lien under the state tax lien registration act, 1968 PA 203, MCL 211.681 to 211.687.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A purchaser or succeeding purchaser of property, from a taxpayer in other than the ordinary course of business, against which a lien has been properly recorded as provided under subsection (2) is personally liable for the unpaid taxes that are due on the lien. The purchaser's liability is limited to the value of the property less any proceeds that were applied to balances due on secured interests which are superior to the lien recorded under subsection (2).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Notwithstanding section 86, a city that has entered into an agreement with the department pursuant to section 9 of chapter 1 may cause a demand to be made on a taxpayer for the payment of a tax due under this ordinance. If the liability remains unpaid for 10 days after the demand and proceedings are not taken to review the liability, a warrant may be issued. Except as provided in this section, the city, through any officer or agent or person authorized to serve process or through authorized employees, may levy on all property and rights to property, real and personal, tangible and intangible, belonging to the taxpayer or on which a lien is provided by law for the amount of the deficiency, and sell the real and personal property of the taxpayer found within the state for the payment of the amount due, the cost of executing the warrant, and the additional penalties and interest. Except as provided in subsection (6), the officer or agent or person serving the warrant shall proceed upon the warrant in all respects and in the same manner as prescribed by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments by a court of record. A city, through its authorized representative, may bid for and purchase any property sold pursuant to this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A person that refuses or fails to surrender any property or rights to property subject to levy, upon demand by the city, is personally liable to the city in a sum equal to the value of the property or rights not surrendered, but not exceeding the amount due for which the levy was made, together with costs and interest on the sum at the rate provided in section 82 from the date of the levy. Any amount, other than costs, recovered under this subsection shall be credited against the liability for the collection of which the levy was made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In addition to the personal liability imposed by subsection (2), if a person required to surrender property or rights to property fails or refuses to surrender the property or rights to property without reasonable cause, the person shall be liable for a penalty equal to 50% of the amount recoverable under subsection (2), none of which penalty shall be credited against the liability for the collection of which the levy was made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A person in possession of, or obligated with respect to, property or property rights subject to levy and upon which a levy has been made who, upon demand of the city, surrenders the property or rights to property or discharges the obligation to the city or who pays a liability under subsection (1) shall have that obligation to a person delinquent in payment of a tax reduced in an amount equal to the property or rights to property surrendered or amounts paid to the city.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Property described in section 6334 of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 6334, is exempt from levy under this section for an unpaid tax. The effect of a levy on salary or wages shall be continuous from the date the levy is first made until the liability out of which the levy arose is satisfied.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A warrant notice of levy may be served by certified mail, return receipt requested, on any person in possession of, or obligated with respect to, property and rights to property, real and personal, tangible and intangible, belonging to the taxpayer or on which a lien is provided by law. The date of delivery on the receipt shall be the date the levy is made. A person may, upon written notice to the department, on behalf of the city, have all notices of levy sent to 1 designated office.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    If the administrator or the department believes that collection of the tax withheld from an employee's compensation as imposed under this ordinance will be jeopardized by delay, the administrator or the department, whether or not the time otherwise prescribed by the ordinance for making the return and paying the tax has expired, shall immediately assess the tax and interest and additions provided by the ordinance. The tax, interest, and additions shall become immediately due and payable, and the administrator or the department shall make an immediate notice and demand for payment, notwithstanding when the withheld tax is otherwise due and payable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the administrator or the department finds that a person liable for the tax administered under this ordinance intends quickly to depart from the city or to remove property from this city, to conceal the person or the person's property in the city, or to do any other act tending to render wholly or partly ineffectual proceedings to collect the tax unless proceedings are brought without delay, the administrator or the department of treasury shall give notice of the findings to the person, together with a demand for an immediate return and immediate payment of the tax. A warrant or warrant-notice of levy may issue immediately upon issuance of a jeopardy assessment. When the warrant or warrant-notice is issued, the tax shall become immediately due and payable. If the person is not in default in making a return or paying a tax prescribed by this ordinance, and furnishes evidence satisfactory to the administrator or the department that the return will be filed and the tax to which the finding relates will be paid, then the tax shall not be payable before the time otherwise fixed for payment. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    If the administrator or the department believes that collection of the tax withheld from an employee's compensation as imposed under this ordinance will be jeopardized by delay, the administrator or the department of treasury, whether or not the time otherwise prescribed by the ordinance for making the return and paying or depositing the tax has expired, shall immediately assess the tax and interest and additions provided by the ordinance.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the administrator or the department finds that a person liable for the tax administered under this ordinance intends quickly to depart from the city or to remove property from this city, to conceal the person or the person's property in the city, or to do any other act tending to render wholly or partly ineffectual proceedings to collect the tax unless proceedings are brought without delay, the administrator or the department of treasury shall give notice of the findings to the person, together with a demand for an immediate return and immediate payment of the tax. A warrant or warrant-notice of levy may issue immediately upon issuance of a jeopardy assessment. When the warrant or warrant-notice is issued, the tax shall become immediately due and payable. If the person is not in default in making a return or paying a tax prescribed by this ordinance, and furnishes evidence satisfactory to the administrator or the department of treasury that the return will be filed and the tax to which the finding relates will be paid, then the tax shall not be payable before the time otherwise fixed for payment.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The legislature finds all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Tourism is a major source of employment, income, and tax revenues in this state, and the expansion of the tourism industry is vital to the growth of the state's economy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The tourism industry is important to this state, not only because of the number of people it serves and the vast human, financial, and physical resources it employs, but because of the benefits tourism and related activities confer on individuals and on society as a whole.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) State oversight and resources are needed to implement a coordinated and effective marketing program consistent with the master plan developed by this state to promote travel to, and within, this state under the Michigan tourism policy act, 1945 PA 106, MCL 2.101 to 2.103a, and to optimize the considerable investment of time, energy, capital, and resources being made by the tourism industry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) This state can best undertake effective tourism marketing through the coordinated efforts of existing state government agencies in tourism promotion and private convention and tourism promotional bureaus who are better able than state agencies to market and promote their unique assessment districts, which will maximize the economic and employment benefits of the tourism industry to this state and its citizens.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The coordinated efforts within this act to market and promote tourism represent a broader regulator scheme that does not impinge on an individual's First Amendment rights.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Nothing in this act shall be construed to do 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Restrain an owner or participant from communicating its own message or marketing plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Require any owner or participant to adopt any actual or symbolic speech.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Upon the effective date of an assessment under section 3a, each owner of a transient facility in the assessment district shall be liable for payment of the assessment, computed by multiplying the percentage set forth in the marketing program notice by the aggregate room charges imposed by the transient facility during a calendar month. The assessment shall be paid by the owner of each transient facility to the bureau or the person designated by the bureau within 30 days after the end of each calendar month, and shall be accompanied by a statement of room charges imposed by the transient facility for that calendar month. This act does not prohibit an owner from reimbursing the transient facility by adding the assessment imposed under this act to room charges payable by transient guests. However, the owner shall disclose that the transient facility has been reimbursed for the assessment imposed under this act on the bill presented to the transient guest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A bureau or person designated by the bureau may enter into an agreement with a regional tourism marketing organization established under the regional tourism marketing act, 1989 PA 244, MCL 141.891 to 141.900, to accept from owners subject to an assessment under this act the payment of assessments that are levied by a regional marketing organization under section 6 of the regional tourism marketing act, 1989 PA 244, MCL 141.896.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Interest shall be paid by an owner to the bureau on any assessments not paid within the time required under this act.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The legislature finds all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Tourism is a major source of employment, income, and tax revenues in this state, and the expansion of the tourism industry is vital to the growth of the state's economy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The tourism industry is important to this state, not only because of the number of people it serves and the vast human, financial, and physical resources it employs, but because of the benefits tourism and related activities confer on individuals and on society as a whole.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) State oversight and resources are needed to implement a coordinated and effective marketing program consistent with the master plan developed by this state to promote travel to, and within, this state under the Michigan tourism policy act, 1945 PA 106, MCL 2.101 to 2.103a, and to optimize the considerable investment of time, energy, capital, and resources being made by the tourism industry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) This state can best undertake effective tourism marketing through the coordinated efforts of existing state government agencies in tourism promotion and private convention and tourism promotional bureaus who are better able than state agencies to market and promote their unique assessment districts, which will maximize the economic and employment benefits of the tourism industry to this state and its citizens.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The coordinated efforts within this act to market and promote tourism represent a broader regulator scheme that does not impinge on an individual's First Amendment rights.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Nothing in this act shall be construed to do 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Restrain an owner or participant from communicating its own message or marketing plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Require any owner or participant to adopt any actual or symbolic speech.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>141.891a Legislative findings.</B><P>Sec. 1a.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The legislature finds all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Tourism is a major source of employment, income, and tax revenues in this state, and the expansion of the tourism industry is vital to the growth of this state's economy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The tourism industry is important to this state, not only because of the number of people it serves and the vast human, financial, and physical resources it employs, but because of the benefits tourism and related activities confer on individuals and on society as a whole.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) State oversight and resources are needed to implement a coordinated and effective marketing program consistent with the master plan developed by this state to promote travel to, and within, this state under the Michigan tourism policy act, 1945 PA 106, MCL 2.101 to 2.103a, and to optimize the considerable investment of time, energy, capital, and resources being made by the tourism industry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) This state can best undertake effective tourism marketing through the coordinated efforts of existing state government agencies in tourism promotion and private convention and tourism promotional bureaus who are better able than state agencies to market and promote their unique assessment districts, which will maximize the economic and employment benefits of the tourism industry to this state and its citizens.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The coordinated efforts within this act to market and promote tourism represent a broader regulator scheme that does not impinge on an individual's First Amendment rights.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Nothing in this act shall be construed to do 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Restrain an owner or participant from communicating its own message or marketing plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Require any owner or participant to adopt any actual or symbolic speech.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Endorse or finance any political speech or ideological view.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Upon the effective date of an assessment under section 4, each owner is liable for payment of the assessment computed by multiplying the percentage set forth in the tourism marketing program notice by the aggregate room charges imposed by the transient facility during a calendar month.

If an owner is subject to assessments under this act and Act No. 395 of the Public Acts of 1980, and an agreement is entered into under this subsection, the owner may satisfy the payment requirements under subsection (1) by paying the assessment under this act to the bureau or the person designated by the bureau under Act No. 395 of the Public Acts of 1980 at the same time the assessment under Act No. 395 of the Public Acts of 1980 is paid by the owner. The regional marketing organization shall reimburse a bureau or the person designated by the bureau under Act No. 395 of the Public Acts of 1980 for reasonable administrative costs incurred to receive and forward assessments due a regional marketing organization under this act. The regional marketing organization may agree with the bureau to allow the bureau or the person designated by the bureau under Act No. 395 of the Public Acts of 1980 to withhold a portion of an assessment received on behalf of the regional marketing organization as reimbursement for the reasonable administrative costs incurred. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Within 30 days after the close of each calendar quarter, each owner shall forward to the independent certified public accountants who audit the financial statements of the regional marketing organization copies of the state use tax returns of the transient facility for the preceding quarter. The copies of the state use tax returns shall be used solely by the certified public accountants to verify and audit the payment of the assessment by the owner under this act, and shall not be disclosed to the regional marketing organization except as the director determines necessary to enforce this act. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   An owner shall pay interest to the regional marketing organization on any assessment not paid within the time required under this act. The interest shall accrue at the rate of 1.5% per month. An owner delinquent for more than 90 days in paying an assessment, in addition to interest, shall pay a penalty of 1.5% per month or fraction of a month on the amount of the delinquent assessment. The regional marketing organization may sue in its own name to collect the assessment, interest, and penalty.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   An owner is not liable for payment of an assessment until a tourism marketing program notice and, if the owner is eligible to vote, the referendum ballot has been mailed to the owner at the last known address of the transient facility pursuant to sections 3 and 4.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) For state fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1992 and ending before October 1, 1996, the collections from the state income tax otherwise available for distribution to counties in November for the quarter period ending the prior September 30 shall be increased by $35,900,000.00 and the collections from the state income tax otherwise available for distribution to counties in August for the quarter period ending the prior June 30 shall be decreased by $35,900,000.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For the 1996-1997 and 1997-1998 state fiscal years, the department of treasury shall cause to be paid to counties on a per capita basis an amount equal to 24.5% of the difference between 21.3% of the sales tax collections at a rate of 4% in the 12-month period ending June 30 of the state fiscal year in which the payments are made and the total distribution for the state fiscal year under section 12a. Subject to section 13d, for the 1998-1999 through 2005-2006 state fiscal years and for the period of October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007, the department of treasury shall cause to be paid to counties all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Except as provided in subdivision (c) and subsection (6), an amount equal to the amount the county was eligible to receive under section 12a in the 1997-1998 state fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Except as provided in subdivision (c) and subsection (6), an amount equal to 25.06% of 21.3% of the sales tax collections at a rate of 4% in the 12-month period ending June 30 of the state fiscal year in which the payments are made minus the amount determined under subdivision (a) which shall be distributed on a per capita basis. If the amount appropriated under this section to counties is less than 25.06% of 21.3% of the sales tax rate of 4%, any reduction made necessary by this appropriation in distributions to counties shall first be applied to the distribution under this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For the 2002-2003 state fiscal year only, each county shall receive the lesser of 96.5%, or the percentage determined under this subdivision, of the amount that the county would have received if the total available for distribution under subdivisions (a) and (b) were $211,549,002.00. The total amount available for distribution to all counties under this subdivision shall not exceed $204,144,787.00.

For the 2003-2004 state fiscal year only, each county shall receive the lesser of 92%, or the percentage determined under this subdivision, of the amount distributed to the county under this subsection for the 2002-2003 state fiscal year. For the 2003-2004 state fiscal year, the percentage under this subdivision shall be determined by dividing the sum of all payments under section 10 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 and $724,800,000.00 by $1,407,850,000.00 and then subtracting 0.08.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The payments under subsection (3) shall be made from revenues collected during the state fiscal year in which the payments are made and shall be made during each October, December, February, April, June, and August. Payments shall be based on collections from the sales tax at a rate of 4% in the 2-month period ending the prior August 31, October 31, December 31, February 28, April 30, and June 30, and for the 1996-1997 and 1997-1998 state fiscal years only the payments shall be reduced by 1/6 of the total distribution for the state fiscal year under section 12a. For state fiscal years after the 1995-1996 state fiscal year, the collections from the sales tax otherwise available for distribution to counties under subsection (3) in December shall be increased by $17,000,000.00 and the collections from the sales tax otherwise available for distribution to counties under subsection (3) in April shall be decreased by $17,000,000.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For state fiscal years beginning after September 30, 2004, the total amount distributed to each county under this section shall equal the amount by which the balance in its revenue sharing reserve fund under section 44a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.44a, for the county's most recent fiscal year that ends prior to the January 1 of the state's fiscal year is less than the amount calculated under section 44a(13) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.44a, for the county fiscal year that begins in the state's fiscal year. Payments under this subsection shall be adjusted as necessary to reflect partial county fiscal years and prorated based on the total amount appropriated for distribution to all counties. Upon the exhaustion of each county's revenue sharing reserve fund, state revenue sharing within that county will be fully and permanently restored in an amount equal to the total payments made to that county under this act in the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, adjusted annually through the date of restoration by the inflation rate, without regard to an executive order issued after May 17, 2004, and prorated based on the amount of the reserve fund used by the county in the fiscal year during which payments are required to resume under this subsection. As used in this subsection, "inflation rate" means that term as defined in section 34d of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.34d. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7)   The department of treasury may withhold all or a portion of payments under this section to a county that has not timely furnished the statement required under section 151(1) of the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1751, or distributed an industrial facilities tax as required under 1974 PA 198, MCL 207.551 to 207.572, or the specific tax as required under section 21b of the enterprise zone act, 1985 PA 224, MCL 125.2121b. Before withholding all or a portion of the payments under this section to a county, the department shall inform the county in writing of the intent to withhold payments and offer an opportunity for an informal conference on the matter.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) For a state fiscal year in which the sales tax collections decrease from the sales tax collections for the immediately preceding state fiscal year, the department shall reduce the amount to be distributed to a city with a population of 750,000 or more under subsection (6) by an amount determined by subtracting the amount the city is eligible for under section 10 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 for the state fiscal year from $333,900,000.00 and multiplying that result by the same percentage as the percentage decrease in sales tax collections for that state fiscal year as compared to sales tax collections for the immediately preceding state fiscal year. This subsection does not apply to the 2002-2003 through 2006-2007 state fiscal years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section for the 1998-1999 state fiscal year, the total combined amount received by each city, village, and township under this section and section 10 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 shall not be less than the combined amount received under this section, section 12a, and section 10 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 in the 1997-1998 state fiscal year. The increase, if any, for each city, village, and township from the 1997-1998 state fiscal year, other than a city that receives a distribution under subsection (6), shall be reduced by a uniform percentage to the extent necessary to fund distributions under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) The payments under subsections (3), (4), and (5) shall be made during each October, December, February, April, June, and August. Payments under subsections (3), (4), and (5) shall be based on collections from the sales tax at the rate of 4% in the 2-month period ending the prior August 31, October 31, December 31, February 28, April 30, and June 30, and for the 1996-1997 and 1997-1998 state fiscal years only, the payments shall be reduced by 1/6 of the total distribution for the state fiscal year under section 12a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) Payments under this section shall be made from revenues collected during the state fiscal year in which the payments are made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) Distributions provided for by this act are subject to an annual appropriation by the legislature.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) After the department has informed a city, village, or township in writing of the intent to withhold all or a portion of payments under this section and offered the affected city, village, or township an opportunity for an informal conference on the matter, the department of treasury may withhold all or a portion of payments under this section to a city, village, or township that has not distributed 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An industrial facilities tax as required under 1974 PA 198, MCL 207.551 to 207.572.</div>

<P>Sec. 13a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Following the official certification and publication of the 1980 federal decennial census, the department of management and budget shall calculate for each city, village, and township: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The payment of revenues a city, village, or township would have received under sections 12 and 13 between April 1, 1980 and October 1, 1980 if those payments had been distributed according to the 1980 census.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The difference in payments determined by subtracting the payment of revenues which were made to a city, village, or township between April 1, 1980 and October 1, 1980 under sections 12, 13, and 14a from the calculation made for the city, village, or township in subdivision (a).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The sum of all the differences in payments determined by subdivision (b) that are greater than zero. This sum shall be known as "the census delay adjustment".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A city, village, or township which has a population according to the 1980 census greater than the population used in computing the August, 1979 distributions to the city, village, or township under this act shall be eligible for census delay adjustment payments. The department of management and budget shall calculate the census delay adjustment payment to be made to each eligible city, village, or township pursuant to the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Dividing the census delay adjustment determined in subsection (1)(c) by 4.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Subtracting the population used in computing the August, 1979 distributions under this act for each eligible city, village, and township from the population according to the 1980 census of each eligible city, village, or township. The differences obtained shall be known as "the growth population".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Summing the differences obtained in subdivision (b).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Dividing the quotient determined in subdivision (a) by the sum determined in subdivision (c). The per capita amount determined pursuant to this calculation shall be distributed in May, 1982; May, 1983; May, 1984; and May, 1985 to each eligible city, village, and township according to its growth population.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The additional sum necessary to provide the distribution required by this section shall be reserved, in amounts determined pursuant to section 13(a), from the collection of state income tax available for distribution to cities, villages, and townships before payments are made under section 13.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   All or part of the census delay adjustment payments required in any or all payment years may be appropriated by the legislature from the state general fund and, if such an appropriation is made, the reserve provided in subsection (3), and the amounts reserved pursuant to section 13(a) from distribution in each payment period for the year shall be reduced by the amount of the general fund appropriation.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A payment required to be made pursuant to section 11, 12, or 13 shall not be delayed so as to cause interest to accrue pursuant to subsection (1) unless the delay in any payment is authorized by a written directive issued and signed by the governor to the director of the department of management and budget and the state treasurer, containing an identification of the specific payment and amount of the payment to be delayed, the period of the delay, the reason for the delay, and the date the delayed payment is expected to be paid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The governor's authorization under subsection (2) shall be signed and issued as soon as the governor determines that the payment will be delayed, which determination shall be made as far in advance of the scheduled payment date as is reasonably possible under the circumstances. The state treasurer immediately shall take such steps as are reasonably necessary to assure that the local units for which a directive applies are notified of that gubernatorial directive.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Amounts required to be paid pursuant to section 11, 12, or 13 that are subject to an unavoidable delay of a de minimis period, or that are withheld or set off pursuant to law in the settlement or adjustment or an obligation or debt due to this state, or that are withheld from payment pursuant to section 17a or 21, shall not be subject to subsections (1) to (3).</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Each city, village, or township shall report its local taxes and special assessments and cities and townships shall report their overlapping taxes to the department of treasury by March 1. A city, village, or township that levied less than 1 mill in the immediately preceding calendar year, when it reports its local taxes, shall also report whether its levied millage rate would have been at least 1 mill except for the millage reductions pursuant to section 31 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963; except for a millage reduction pursuant to section 34 of the general property tax act, Act No. 206 of the Public Acts of 1893, being section 211.34 of the Michigan Compiled Laws; or except for the fact that the city, village, or township did not elect to increase the millage rate permitted by operation of section 24e(2) of Act No. 206 of the Public Acts of 1893, being section 211.24e of the Michigan Compiled Laws, or for any combination of these exceptions. If a city, village, or township fails to report as provided in this section, the department of treasury shall give notice of the failure to the assessor and the chief executive officer of the city, village, or township. After the department of treasury gives notice, payments under this act shall be withheld. The withheld payments may later be issued if the city, village, or township reports before the end of the revenue sharing year. Not later than May 15, the department of treasury shall report to the department of management and budget the local taxes, special assessments, overlapping taxes, and taxable value, and whether the levied millage rate would have been at least 1 mill if the required millage reductions or limitations had not been applied, for each city, village, and township for the immediately preceding calendar year. In determining and reporting the overlapping taxes for a township and the villages within the township, the department of treasury shall prorate and allocate the overlapping taxes levied in the township to the township and each village in the same ratio that the taxable value of the unincorporated area of the township and of each village bears to the total taxable value of the township.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Before December 2 of each year, each city, village, and township shall report to the department of treasury, on a form prepared by the department of treasury in consultation with the department of management and budget, all local revenues collected by the city, village, or township in the local unit's fiscal year that ends during the immediately preceding July 1 to June 30 period. The department of treasury shall accumulate the reports and submit a summary to the department of management and budget by February 1. The department of management and budget shall analyze the reports and shall make recommendations to the legislature regarding other local general fund revenues that the department considers reflective of or equivalent to local tax effort. Other local revenues do not include state or federal shared revenues, block grants, or categorical grants, or grants or gifts from other sources, but do include fees or charges imposed by the city, village, or township for municipal purposes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The department of treasury shall report to the department of management and budget the tax collections available for distribution. The department of management and budget may make the distribution in a single warrant. A millage rate certified to be levied for a city, village, or township of 1 mill or more that is reduced below 1 mill pursuant to section 31 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963, pursuant to section 34 of Act No. 206 of the Public Acts of 1893, or because the city, village, or township did not elect to increase the millage rate permitted by operation of section 24e(2) of Act No. 206 of the Public Acts of 1893, or due to any combination of these factors, shall be considered by the department of management and budget to be 1 mill for all of the following purposes:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Payments under sections 12(2) and 15, which payments shall be calculated using the actual local property taxes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Determining whether the city, village, or township is eligible under section 14 for payments based upon the tax burden formula, which formula shall be calculated using the actual local property taxes.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A loan made under this act shall bear an annual rate or rates of interest, if any, as established by the board under section 2(5). The board may establish interest for a loan under this act either at a rate or rates that are fixed for the term of the loan or, if the formula is approved by the board at the time the loan is made or renegotiated as authorized in section 2, at a rate calculated upon a formula that varies the rate annually. The board may provide that the interest rate or rates for a loan under this act may adjust to an interest rate or rates determined at the time of the sale or transfer by the state treasurer to be sufficient to facilitate the sale of the loans under section 6a. Except for loans sold or transferred under section 6a, if the interest rate for a loan under this act is a single fixed rate, the annual rate of interest for the term of a loan shall not be less than the municipal 10-year rate as determined by the state treasurer. The board may consider a higher interest rate based on both the market interest rates and the risk of the municipality requesting the loan. Except for loans sold or transferred under section 6a, if the interest rate for a loan under this section is not a single fixed rate, both of the following apply to the loan:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The annual rate of interest for the loan shall not be less than 2.5%, but the board may consider a higher interest rate based on both the market interest rates and the risk of the municipality requesting the loan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the loan includes an interest-only repayment period, the interest-only repayment period shall not be more than 60 months.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Interest payments are due and payable as determined by the board or the state treasurer under section 6a. Repayment of all of the principal shall be made not more than 30 years from the date of issuance determined by the board or state treasurer under section 6a, except as provided in subsection (5). This subsection, section 7, and the conditions listed in section 4(1) do not apply to a loan authorized under section 3(2) or (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The loan agreement between the board and a county for a loan authorized under section 3(2) or (3) shall establish the schedule for payment of the principal of and interest on the loan, the nature of the obligation of the county to repay a loan made under this act, and any security for that loan. Payments of principal and interest for a loan authorized by section 3(2) shall be limited to revenues allocated to the county under the health and safety fund act, 1987 PA 264, MCL 141.471 to 141.479, minus those revenues authorized by the board in the loan agreement for use in the payment of other county obligations. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Unless other state appropriations to a municipality are pledged or assigned in an amount sufficient for the municipality to make a required principal or interest payment, if the municipality's payment of required principal or interest is delinquent, the state treasurer may withhold the amount of all delinquent payments that are due on a loan issued under this act from state payments to the municipality under the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921, or from the municipality's portion of the revenue generated by the local community stabilization share tax levied under the use tax act, 1937 PA 94, MCL 205.91 to 205.111, and payable by the department of treasury to the local community stabilization authority created under the local community stabilization authority act, 2014 PA 86, MCL 123.1341 to 123.1362, for distribution to the municipality or other governmental entities, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except for loans sold or transferred under section 6a or as otherwise determined by the board, notwithstanding the payment schedules and methods established by this section or by the terms of a loan agreement, a municipality may initiate repayment of all or part of a loan made under this act at an earlier date or may make repayment in fewer installment payments, or both. The board shall not condition either eligibility for consideration for a loan or the grant of a loan under this act on repayment schedules and terms other than those required by subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4). In addition, failure of a municipality to make repayments under terms or a schedule it has instituted under this subsection does not disqualify the municipality from eligibility for consideration for loans in subsequent fiscal years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A loan issued under this act shall be a general obligation of the municipality except that a loan issued under section 3(2) shall not be a general obligation of the municipality and shall be repaid solely from specific revenues pledged for repayment of the loan.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) All bonds or obligations issued pursuant to this act before April 11, 1988 are subject to the requirements of former 1981 PA 97.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Unless otherwise provided by the city or county in the resolution required by section 4, bonds or obligations issued pursuant to this act on or after April 11, 1988 and before January 1, 2010 are not subject to the requirements of former 1981 PA 97, notwithstanding that distributable aid is pledged or assigned to secure bonds or obligations under this act. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In the resolution authorizing the bonds or obligations, the legislative body of the city or county may provide for appointment of a trustee, escrow agent, or other person to hold funds or reserves for payment of the bonds or obligations and to perform other duties as the city or county determines, may provide for the vesting in the trustee, escrow agent, or other designated person the property, rights, powers, and remedies as the city or county determines, may pledge and create a lien upon any unencumbered revenues or taxes of the city or county, and may provide for payment of pledged revenues or taxes directly to a paying agent, trustee, escrow agent, the state treasurer, or other person to be held and used solely for payment of principal and interest on the bonds or obligations. A pledge pursuant to this act for benefit of bondholders or others is perfected without delivery, recording, or notice. The resolution authorizing the bonds or obligations also may provide for covenants and promises with respect to fiscal, budget, and accounting matters that are considered necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the city or county to sell the bonds or obligations to the best advantage of the city or county. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In the resolution authorizing the bonds or obligations for the payment of the bonds or obligations, the city or county may provide for the payment of the bonds or obligations with distributable aid received or to be received by the city or county derived from the imposition of taxes by the state and returned or to be returned to the city or county as provided by law except for money that the state constitution of 1963 prohibits for use for such a pledge. The city or county and the state treasurer may enter into an agreement providing for the direct payment of distributable aid to a paying agent, trustee, escrow agent, or other person to be used for the sole purpose of paying principal or interest on bonds or obligations issued pursuant to this act, and that money may be pledged by the city or county for the payment of bonds or obligations issued under this act. If the city or county and the state treasurer enter into such an agreement, notwithstanding any other provision of this act to the contrary, for bonds or obligations issued after the effective date of the 2010 amendatory act that amended this subsection and made payable from distributable aid in the resolution authorizing those bonds or obligations a statutory lien and trust is created applicable to distributable aid received or to be received from the state treasurer by a paying agent, escrow agent, or a trustee, after the distributable aid has been appropriated but subject to any subsequent reduction of that appropriation by operation of law or executive order. The distributable aid paid or to be paid to a paying agent, trustee, escrow agent, or other person for the purpose of paying the principal of and interest on the bonds or obligations issued pursuant to this act shall be subject to a lien and trust, which for bonds or obligations issued pursuant to this act after the effective date of the 2010 amendatory act that amended this subsection and after bonds are issued subject to the statutory lien created by this subsection, is hereby made a statutory lien and trust paramount and superior to all other liens and interests of any kind, for the sole purpose of paying the principal of and interest on bonds and obligations issued pursuant to this act. The lien created under this subsection for the benefit of bondholders or others is perfected without delivery, recording, or notice. The distributable aid held or to be held by a paying agent, trustee, escrow agent, or other person shall be held in trust for the sole benefit of the holders of the bonds or obligations issued pursuant to this act and shall be exempt from being levied upon, taken, sequestered, or applied toward paying the debts or liabilities of the city or county other than for payment of debt service on the bonds or obligations to which the lien applies and the holders of bonds or obligations issued pursuant to this act after January 1, 2010, but before September 1, 2010, shall have a first priority lien that is paramount and superior to all other liens and interests of any kind that arise or are created after the effective date of the 2010 amendatory act that amended this subsection and after bonds are issued subject to the statutory lien created by this subsection. However, nothing in the 2010 amendatory act that amended this subsection shall abridge or reduce the ability of the state treasurer to withhold distributable aid from a city or county as provided by the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921. For bonds or obligations issued pursuant to this act after January 1, 2010 and before September 1, 2010, the maximum principal and interest becoming due on the bonds or obligations in any fiscal year shall not exceed the amount of shared revenues received by the city for the state fiscal year ending September 30, 2009 as provided for in the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921, and as provided in the state constitution of 1963. This subsection shall not be construed to do any of the following: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Create or constitute state indebtedness.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Require the state to continue to impose and collect taxes from which distributable aid is paid or to make payments of distributable aid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Limit or prohibit the state from repealing or amending a law enacted for the imposition of taxes from which distributable aid is paid, for the payment or apportionment of distributable aid, or for the manner, time, or amount of distributable aid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) With respect to bonds or obligations issued on or before September 30, 1988, in the resolution authorizing the bonds or obligations, the legislative body of the city or county may provide that, from each collection of ad valorem property taxes after the issuance of the bonds or obligations, there shall be set aside in a special fund, to be used for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds or obligations, an amount equal to the total amount of the collection multiplied by a fraction determined as follows: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The numerator of the fraction is 125% of the amount of principal and interest coming due on the bonds or obligations in the current fiscal year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The denominator of the fraction is the total amount of the tax levied for the current fiscal year multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total of the taxes collected during the 5 prior fiscal years and the denominator of which is the total of taxes levied during the 5 prior fiscal years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An authorizing resolution under subsection (4) or (5) may provide that all or any portion of the taxes collected and set aside as provided in subsection (5) shall not be used for any other purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) As used in this section, "distributable aid" means state shared revenues provided for in the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921, any other law providing for distribution of state shared revenues which are derived from the same taxes distributed under the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921, and any law providing reimbursement to a municipality under the state constitution of 1963 as reimbursement for revenue which would otherwise be collected from taxes imposed by the municipality.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The governing body of a city having a population of 600,000 or more, by a lawfully adopted ordinance that incorporates by reference the uniform city utility users tax ordinance set forth in chapter 2, may levy, assess, and collect from those users in that city a utility users tax as provided in the ordinance. However, a uniform city utility users tax ordinance containing substantially the same provisions provided for in chapter 2 adopted by the governing body of a city before June 13, 1990 that has not been rescinded by that governing body is considered an ordinance adopted under this act and a tax imposed and collected under that ordinance is revived. The governing body shall set the rate of tax in increments of 1/4 of 1% that shall not exceed 5%. If a city currently eligible to levy a tax under this act enters into a contract with a lighting authority, in which it pledges revenues from the taxes levied under this act, the city is authorized to levy the tax under this act until all related outstanding bonds of the lighting authority have been paid notwithstanding the population of that city.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A uniform city utility users tax ordinance may be lawfully adopted or unless revenues have been otherwise pledged rescinded by the governing body at any time and its adoption shall become effective on the first day of any month, following adoption of the ordinance, as specified in the ordinance. The ordinance may be rescinded at any time by the governing body in the same manner in which the ordinance was adopted and with appropriate enforcement, collection, and refund provisions with respect to liabilities incurred before the effective date of its rescission. The ordinance shall not be amended except as provided by the legislature. A village and a city under 600,000 population shall not impose and collect a utility users tax except as otherwise provided in subsection (1). A city that adopts or rescinds the tax shall notify within 7 days by certified mail all public utilities or resale customers affected by the action of the governing body. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a city now having or that may attain a population of 600,000 or more shall not impose a utility users tax except by adopting the entire uniform city utility users tax ordinance as set forth in chapter 2.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The administrator, as that term is defined in chapter 2, of the tax shall file a report indicating the total amount of revenue collected in the prior fiscal year with the state revenue commissioner by August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 1985. The administrator shall make the report available to the public at the same time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Unless revenues have been otherwise pledged to pay bonds issued by a lighting authority, the revenue generated from this tax shall be placed directly in the budget of the police department of a city described in this act and shall be used exclusively to retain or hire police officers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Notwithstanding subsection (4) or any ordinance of a city to the contrary, a city that forms a lighting authority shall pay $12,500,000.00 annually to that lighting authority from the proceeds of the tax authorized under this act. If the lighting authority issues bonds pursuant to a contract with the city under this act and pledges revenues from taxes levied under this act, those revenues shall be deposited and used as provided in this act. After a contract described in this subsection is entered into, the trustee, after setting aside funds as required by the trust indenture, shall pay to the lighting authority $12,500,000.00, less the amount set aside. The trust indenture shall provide that the remaining revenues be returned to the city. Nothing in this subsection shall obligate a city or trustee to remit to the lighting authority more than is collected from taxes levied under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) As used in this section, "police officer" means a police officer, investigator, or police sergeant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) As used in this act, "lighting authority" means a lighting authority created under the municipal lighting authority act.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 8.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   This act is intended to eliminate the confusion surrounding the legal status of Act No. 198 of the Public Acts of 1970 resulting from an opinion of the attorney general regarding the validity of enactment of various public acts, OAG, 1987-1988, No 6438, p 80 (May 21, 1987) and a circuit court decision in the matter of Ace Tex Corp v Detroit rendered on February 2, 1990 (Wayne County Circuit Court Case No. 88-807858-CZ), as to which an appeal is pending, and to resolve legislatively the issues raised by the appeal. Before that circuit court decision, the legislature had been advised by the attorney general's office in May 1987 that legislative action was not necessary to authorize the collection of the city utility users tax after July 1, 1988 under Act No. 198 of the Public Acts of 1970. In light of the circuit court decision of February 2, 1990, which is presently on appeal, it appears that legislative action is advisable to clarify the authorization for and to ratify the collection of the tax from July 1, 1988, to authorize the continued collection of the tax, and to resolve legislatively the issues raised by appeal. The legislature by enactment of this act intends to validate, ratify, and revive effective from July 1, 1988 a city utility users tax. This act is remedial and curative and is intended to revive and assure an uninterrupted continuation of the authority to collect a city utility users tax. The legislature finds the city utility users tax was authorized by law on the date when section 31 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963 was ratified. </DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) This state can best undertake effective tourism marketing through the coordinated efforts of existing state government agencies in tourism promotion and private convention and tourism promotional bureaus who are better able than state agencies to market and promote their unique assessment districts, which will maximize the economic and employment benefits of the tourism industry to this state and its citizens.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the property of the authority created under this act and its income, activities, and operations are exempt from all taxes and special assessments of this state or a political subdivision of this state. Property of an authority and its income, activities, and operations that are leased to private persons are not exempt from any tax or special assessment of this state or a political subdivision of this state.

An authority is an entity of government for purposes of section 4a(1)(a) of the general sales tax act, 1933 PA 167, MCL 205.54a, and section 4(1)(h) of the use tax act, 1937 PA 94, MCL 205.94.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The validity of the creation of an authority shall be conclusively presumed unless questioned in an original action filed in the court of appeals within 60 days after the creation of the authority under this section.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Any contract, agreement, lease, sale, disposition, transfer, or other conveyance, easement, license, right, obligation, debt, or liability assumed, approved, entered into, amended, or modified in violation of this section shall be voidable as a matter of law to the extent that the authority would otherwise assume, become party to or transferee of, or otherwise be obligated under the contract, agreement, lease, sale, disposition, transfer, conveyance, easement, license, right, obligation, debt, or liability.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The authority, as of the transfer date, immediately shall assume and be bound by any existing collective bargaining agreements applicable to employees of the local government whose employment is transferred to the authority either as a result of the authority's express assumption of the employees or by application of section 19 for the remainder of the term of the collective bargaining agreement. Local government employees whose employment is not transferred to the authority shall be reassigned within the local government, pursuant to the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreements. A representative of the employees or a group of employees in the local government who represents or is entitled to represent the employees or a group of employees of the local government pursuant to 1947 PA 336, MCL 423.201 to 423.217, shall continue to represent the employee or group of employees after the employees transfer to the authority. This subsection does not limit the rights of employees, pursuant to applicable law, to assert that a bargaining representative protected by this subsection is no longer their representative. The rights and benefits protected by this subsection may be altered by a future collective bargaining agreement or, for employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements, by benefit plans as established and adopted by the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Transferred employees shall not by reason of the transfer have their accrued local government pension benefits or credits diminished. If a transferring employee is not vested in his or her local government pension rights at the time of transfer, his or her posttransfer service with the authority shall be credited toward vesting in any local government retirement system in which the transferring employee participated prior to the transfer, but posttransfer service with the authority shall not be credited for any other purpose under the local government's retirement system, except as provided in subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A transferred local government employee described in this section or a person hired by the authority as a new employee after the transfer date may remain or become a participant in the local government retirement system until the authority has established its own retirement system or pension plan. During the period the employee remains or is a participant in the local government system, the employee's posttransfer service with the authority and his or her posttransfer compensation from the authority shall be counted in determining both eligibility for and the amount of pension benefits that the employee will be eligible to receive from the local government system or plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the local government maintains a retirement system that provides for continuing participation and benefit accrual by local government employees who transfer their employment to another entity in conjunction with transfer of a local government function to that entity, then the transferred employee may elect to remain a participant in the local government retirement system in lieu of participation in any retirement system or pension plan of the authority. If the transferred employee elects to remain a participant in the local government system, the employee's posttransfer service with the authority and his or her posttransfer compensation from the authority shall be counted in determining both eligibility for and the amount of pension benefits that the employee will be eligible to receive from the local government system or plan. Any election to remain in a local government system or plan shall be made within 60 days following the date the authority has established its own retirement system or pension plan and shall be irrevocable. Employees eligible to make the election described in this subsection shall be those employees who immediately before their transfer date were participating in the local government system and who agree to make any employee contributions required for continuing participation in the local government system and also agree to meet all requirements and be subject to all conditions that, from time to time, apply to employees of the local government who participate in the local government system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) For each employee meeting the requirements of subsection (4) who elects to remain a participant in the local government retirement system, the authority shall, on a timely basis, contribute, as applicable, to the trustees of that retirement system an amount determined by the local government system's actuary to be sufficient to fund the liability for all of that employee's retirement and other postemployment benefits under the system on a current basis, as those liabilities are accrued from and after the transfer date.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) This state can best undertake effective tourism marketing through the coordinated efforts of existing state government agencies in tourism promotion and private convention and tourism promotional bureaus who are better able than state agencies to market and promote their unique assessment districts, which will maximize the economic and employment benefits of the tourism industry to this state and its citizens.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The coordinated efforts within this act to market and promote tourism represent a broader regulator scheme that does not impinge on an individual's First Amendment rights.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Nothing in this act shall be construed to do 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Restrain an owner or participant from communicating its own message or marketing plan.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A neutral evaluation process may be utilized as provided for in this act.

A local government shall initiate the neutral evaluation process by providing notice by certified mail of a request for neutral evaluation process to all interested parties. If the local government does not provide notice under this subsection to all interested parties within 7 days after selecting the neutral evaluation process option, the treasurer may require the local government to go into receivership and proceed under section 9.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An interested party shall respond within 10 business days of receipt of notice of the local government's request for neutral evaluation process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The local government and the interested parties agreeing to participate in the neutral evaluation process shall, through a mutually agreed-upon process, select a neutral evaluator to oversee the neutral evaluation process and facilitate all discussions in an effort to resolve their disputes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the local government and interested parties fail to agree on a neutral evaluator within 7 days after the interested parties have responded to the notification sent by the local government, the local government shall, within 7 days, select 5 qualified neutral evaluators and provide their names, references, and backgrounds to the participating interested parties. Within 3 business days, a majority of participating interested parties may disqualify up to 4 names from the list. If a majority of participating interested parties disqualify 4 names from the list, the remaining candidate shall be the neutral evaluator. If the majority of participating parties disqualify fewer than 4 names, the local government shall choose which of the remaining candidates shall be the neutral evaluator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If an interested party objects to the qualifications of the neutral evaluator after the process for selection in subsection (4) is complete, the interested party may appeal to the state treasurer to determine if the neutral evaluator meets the qualifications under subsection (6). If the state treasurer determines that the qualifications have been met, the neutral evaluation process shall continue. If the state treasurer determines that the qualifications have not been met, the state treasurer shall select the neutral evaluator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A neutral evaluator shall have experience and training in conflict resolution and alternative dispute resolution and have at least 1 of the following qualifications:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) At least 10 years of high-level business or legal experience involving bankruptcy or service as a United States bankruptcy judge.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ix) Federal labor law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The neutral evaluator's performance shall be impartial, objective, independent, and free from prejudice. The neutral evaluator shall not act with partiality or prejudice based on any participant's personal characteristics, background, values, or beliefs, or performance during the neutral evaluation process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The neutral evaluator shall avoid a conflict of interest and the appearance of a conflict of interest during the neutral evaluation process. The neutral evaluator shall make a reasonable inquiry to determine whether there are any facts that a reasonable individual would consider likely to create a potential or actual conflict of interest. Notwithstanding subsection (16), if the neutral evaluator is informed of the existence of any facts that a reasonable individual would consider likely to create a potential or actual conflict of interest, the neutral evaluator shall disclose these facts in writing to the local government and all interested parties involved in the neutral evaluation process. If any participating interested party to the neutral evaluation process objects to the neutral evaluator, that interested party shall notify the local government and all other participating interested parties to the neutral evaluation process, including the neutral evaluator, within 15 days of receipt of the notice from the neutral evaluator.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Before commencing a neutral evaluation process, the neutral evaluator shall not establish another fiscal or fiduciary relationship with any of the interested parties or the local government in a manner that would raise questions about the integrity of the neutral evaluation process, except that the neutral evaluator may conduct further neutral evaluation processes regarding other potential local public entities that may involve some of the same or similar constituents to a prior mediation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The neutral evaluator shall conduct the neutral evaluation process in a manner that promotes voluntary, uncoerced decision making in which each participant makes free and informed choices regarding the neutral evaluation process and outcome.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The neutral evaluator shall not impose a settlement on the participants. The neutral evaluator shall use his or her best efforts to assist the participants to reach a satisfactory resolution of their disputes. Subject to the discretion of the neutral evaluator, the neutral evaluator may make oral or written recommendations for a settlement or plan of readjustment to a participant privately or to all participants jointly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The neutral evaluator shall inform the local government and all participants of the provisions of chapter 9 relative to other chapters of title 11 of the United States Code, 11 USC 101 to 1532. This instruction shall highlight the limited authority of United States bankruptcy judges in chapter 9, including, but not limited to, the restriction on federal bankruptcy judges' authority to interfere with or force liquidation of a local government's property and the lack of flexibility available to federal bankruptcy judges to reduce or cram down debt repayments and similar efforts not available to reorganize the operations of the local government that may be available to a corporate entity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The neutral evaluator may request from the participants documentation and other information that the neutral evaluator believes may be helpful in assisting the participants to address the obligations between them. This documentation may include the status of funds of the local government that clearly distinguishes between general funds and special funds and the proposed plan of readjustment prepared by the local government. The participants shall respond to a request from the neutral evaluator in a timely manner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) The neutral evaluator shall provide counsel and guidance to all participants, shall not be a legal representative of any participant, and shall not have a fiduciary duty to any participant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) If a settlement with all interested parties and the local government occurs, the neutral evaluator may assist the participants in negotiating a pre-petitioned, pre-agreed-upon plan of readjustment in connection with a potential chapter 9 filing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) If at any time during the neutral evaluation process the local government and a majority of the representatives of the interested parties participating in the neutral evaluation process wish to remove the neutral evaluator, the local government or any interested party may make a request to the other interested parties to remove the neutral evaluator. If the local government and a majority of the interested parties agree that the neutral evaluator should be removed and agree on who should replace the neutral evaluator, the local government and the interested parties shall select a new neutral evaluator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) The local government and all interested parties participating in the neutral evaluation process shall negotiate in good faith.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) The local government and each interested party shall provide a representative to attend all sessions of a neutral evaluation process. Each representative shall have the authority to settle and resolve disputes or shall be in a position to present any proposed settlement or plan of readjustment to the participants in the neutral evaluation process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) The local government and the participating interested parties shall maintain the confidentiality of the neutral evaluation process and shall not at the conclusion of the neutral evaluation process or during any bankruptcy proceeding disclose statements made, information disclosed, or documents prepared or produced unless a judge in a chapter 9 bankruptcy proceeding orders that the information be disclosed to determine the eligibility of a local government to proceed with a bankruptcy proceeding under chapter 9, or as otherwise required by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) A neutral evaluation process authorized by this act shall not last for more than 60 days following the date the neutral evaluator is initially selected, unless the local government or a majority of participating interested parties elect to extend the neutral evaluation process for up to 30 additional days. The neutral evaluation process shall not last for more than 90 days following the date the neutral evaluator is initially selected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) The local government shall pay 50% of the costs of a neutral evaluation process, including, but not limited to, the fees of the neutral evaluator, and the interested parties shall pay the balance of the costs of the neutral evaluation process, unless otherwise agreed to by the local government and a majority of the interested parties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) The neutral evaluation process shall end if any of the following occur:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The local government and the participating interested parties execute a settlement agreement. However, if the state treasurer determines that the settlement agreement does not provide sufficient savings to the local government, the state treasurer shall provide notice to the local government that the settlement agreement does not provide sufficient savings to the local government and the local government shall proceed under 1 of the other local government options as provided in section 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The local government and the participating interested parties reach an agreement or proposed plan of readjustment that requires the approval of a bankruptcy judge.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The neutral evaluation process has exceeded 60 days following the date the neutral evaluator was selected, the local government and the participating interested parties have not reached an agreement, and neither the local government nor a majority of the interested parties elect to extend the neutral evaluation process past the initial 60-day time period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The local government initiated the neutral evaluation process under subsection (1) and did not receive a response from any interested party within the time specified in subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The fiscal condition of the local government deteriorates to the point that necessitates the need to proceed under the chapter 9 bankruptcy option pursuant to section 26.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(23) If the 60-day time period for a neutral evaluation process expires, including any extension of the neutral evaluation process past the initial 60-day time period under subsection (20), and the neutral evaluation process is complete with differences resolved, the neutral evaluation process shall be concluded. If the neutral evaluation process does not resolve all pending disputes with the local government and the interested parties, or if subsection (22)(b), (c), or (d) applies, the governing body of the local government shall adopt a resolution recommending that the local government proceed under chapter 9 and submit the resolution to the governor and the state treasurer. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if the local government has a strong mayor, the resolution requires strong mayor approval before the local government proceeds under chapter 9. The resolution shall include a statement determining that the financial condition of the local government jeopardizes the health, safety, and welfare of the residents who reside within the local government or service area of the local government absent the protections of chapter 9. If the governor approves the resolution for the local government to proceed under chapter 9, the governor shall inform the local government in writing of the decision. The governor may place contingencies on a local government in order to proceed under chapter 9 including, but not limited to, appointing a person to act exclusively on behalf of the local government in the chapter 9 bankruptcy proceedings. If the governing body of the local government fails to adopt a resolution within 7 days after the neutral evaluation process is concluded as provided in this subsection, the governor may appoint a person to act exclusively on behalf of the local government in chapter 9 bankruptcy proceedings. If the governor does not appoint a person to act exclusively on behalf of the local government in chapter 9 bankruptcy proceedings, the chief administrative officer of the local government shall act exclusively on behalf of the local government in chapter 9 bankruptcy proceedings. Upon receiving written approval from the governor under section 26, the local government may file a petition under chapter 9 and exercise powers under federal bankruptcy law.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>141.1632 Legislative findings and declarations.</B><P>Sec. 2.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The legislature finds and declares the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) It is the public policy of this state to exercise its sovereign powers with regard to debt issuance and matters of statewide concern in a manner calculated to foster the fiscal integrity of all municipal governments and school districts to assure that those municipalities and school districts provide for the health, safety, and welfare of their residents; pay principal and interest owed on debt obligations when due; meet financial obligations to their existing and former employees, vendors, and suppliers; and provide for proper financial planning procedures and budgeting practices. The inability of a municipal government to provide essential services to its citizens or a school district to provide public education services to its residents as a result of fiscal emergencies is determined to affect adversely the health, safety, and welfare of not only that municipality's citizens and a school district's residents, but also other citizens of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The police and fire retirement system of certain qualified cities and the general retirement system of certain qualified cities are currently underfunded, causing communities across the state to face higher costs to borrow and invest funds, and have caused bondholders, bond insurers, and financial institutions anxiety over the financial health of not only certain qualified cities, but communities across this state. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Absent prospective state oversight over qualified cities and school districts, there exists a threat of increased costs in borrowing, reductions in credit or bond ratings, reduced faith from existing creditors of municipalities or school districts and of this state, and dire financial circumstances from which this state and its political subdivisions may never fully recover.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Qualified cities and school districts have complex budgetary and fiscal needs, significant and complicated debt management issues, and financial assets and liabilities that impact, both positively and negatively, every unit of local government and school district in this state and this state itself such that reasonable and balanced state oversight over qualified cities and school districts is required as a reasonable exercise of this state's power for the benefit of residents throughout this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) There are numerous residents of this state who have accrued pension benefits from a qualified city's pension systems, and those pensioners may reside throughout this state. The settlement of bankruptcy cases involving qualified cities is likely to have a substantial positive impact statewide.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Establishing a commission and execution by the commission of its powers granted under this act fulfill in all respects a public and governmental purpose for the benefit of the people of this state. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Ongoing fiscal oversight over qualified cities and school districts is a reasonable and sufficiently narrow regulation and serves a significant and legitimate public purpose because it inures to the benefit of all of this state's residents and aids in the remedy of a broad and general social problem. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Fiscal oversight over qualified cities and over school districts will ensure that those qualified cities and school districts do not engage in the financial practices that led to financial emergencies and insolvency, and ultimately, entry into receivership and bankruptcy, which will ensure that those cities can provide basic and essential municipal services to their residents and that those school districts can provide public education services to their residents.</div>

If a municipality collects its taxes in installments and issues a municipal security in anticipation of more than 1 installment, the requirements of the preceding sentence shall apply to each installment of taxes. The collection of the taxes to be set aside shall not be used for any other purpose. If the municipality determines that issuing municipal securities for this purpose will result in a deficiency in the funds available to pay the necessary operating expenditures of the next succeeding fiscal year, the municipality shall levy additional taxes in the future from within constitutional, charter, and statutory limits to prevent a continuation of the deficiency from year to year.</DIV>

The proceeds from the municipal security shall not fund capitalized interest on the municipal security or any required unfunded actuarial liability payments not made prior to the issuance of the municipal security.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The projected net present value savings between the actuarially determined amortization payments at the plan's investment rate of return and the municipal security's debt service requirements at the time of issuance, calculated using a method approved by the department, shall be at least 15% of the par amount of a proposed municipal security issued pursuant to subsection (1), or shall be at least 20% of the par amount of a proposed municipal security issued pursuant to subsection (2) unless the department determines that otherwise the plan in its entirety is in the financial best interest of the county, city, village, or township.</div>

However, a county, city, village, or township may reduce benefits of the defined benefit plan for years of service that accrue after the issuance of municipal securities under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A county, city, village, or township shall not issue a municipal security under subsection (1) or (2) unless the county, city, village, or township has been assigned a credit rating within the category of A or higher or the equivalent by at least 1 nationally recognized rating agency.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A refunding security issued to refund municipal securities issued under the terms of the drain code of 1956, 1956 PA 40, MCL 280.1 to 280.630, shall be of the same character as the refunded outstanding municipal security and shall be construed to be a continuation of the refunded outstanding municipal security. A refunding security issued to refund an outstanding municipal security secured by an unlimited tax full faith and credit pledge shall be secured by an unlimited tax full faith and credit pledge. Refunding securities for outstanding securities issued under the revenue bond act of 1933, 1933 PA 94, MCL 141.101 to 141.140, shall be secured by the same pledge as the outstanding securities being refunded.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in section 515 or subsection (2), a municipality shall not refund all or any part of its outstanding securities by issuing a refunding security unless the net present value of the principal and interest to be paid on the refunding security, including the cost of issuance, and taking into account an agreement entered into pursuant to section 317, is less than the net present value of the principal and interest to be paid on the outstanding security being refunded as calculated using a method approved by the department. However, when a municipality is issuing refunding securities for outstanding variable interest rate securities, as determined by the department the net present value calculation shall use the appropriate current fixed interest rate and the fixed interest rate that would have been available for the outstanding variable interest rate securities when originally issued if the outstanding variable interest rate securities had been issued as fixed interest rate securities or shall use another procedure determined by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A municipality may, under procedures established by the department, obtain an exception from the requirements of subsection (1) if the department determines a reasonable basis for that exception exists. As used in this subsection, reasonable basis means 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The refunding is required by a state or federal agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The refunding is necessary to reduce or eliminate requirements of ordinances or covenants applicable to the existing outstanding security.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The refunding is necessary to avoid a potential default on an outstanding security.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The refunding of a short-term municipal security issued under section 413.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A municipality may issue a refunding security to refund all or any part of its outstanding securities before December 31, 2012 if those securities are not secured by the unlimited full faith and credit pledge of the municipality and the refunding is approved by the department. The municipality shall hold a public hearing before submitting a request to the department pursuant to this subdivision. The municipality shall publish notice of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality not less than 30 days before the hearing. After the hearing, the municipality may prepare and submit to the department a request to issue a refunding security pursuant to this subdivision. The department shall not unreasonably withhold approval. The department shall have 90 days from the date it receives a completed request to issue a refunding security pursuant to this subdivision to approve or deny the request. If the department fails to approve or deny the request within 90 days of receiving the completed request, the municipality's request is deemed approved by the department. If the department denies the request, it shall advise the municipality in writing of the reasons for the denial.</div>

<P>Sec. 701.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Subject to subsection (3), if a municipality has municipal securities outstanding, or with the approval of its electors has authorized the issuance of municipal securities to be paid from collections of its next tax levy, an officer or official body charged with a duty in connection with the determination of the amount of the next taxes to be raised or with the levying of the next taxes, shall include all of the following in the amount of taxes levied each year:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   An amount such that the estimated collections will be sufficient to promptly pay, when due, the interest on all municipal securities and the portion of the principal falling due whether by maturity or by mandatory redemption before the time of the following year's tax collection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   An amount, if there are outstanding mandatory redemption refunding securities, sufficient to provide the sum required to be deposited, by the ordinance or resolution authorizing the issue, into the sinking fund for that purpose before the time of the following year's tax collection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   An amount, if there are outstanding mandatory redemption municipal securities other than refunding securities not required to be redeemed in annual amounts before the maturity of the outstanding mandatory redemption municipal securities, that if deposited annually into a sinking fund will, with the existing sinking fund pertaining to the municipal securities and the increment of the municipal securities, be sufficient to pay the municipal securities at maturity.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   An amount necessary to pay debt service charges or obligations on municipal securities or agreements described in section 317(5) falling due in the immediately preceding fiscal year, to the extent that the tax levy in the preceding fiscal year was inadequate to pay, when due, the debt service charges or obligations on municipal securities or agreements described in section 317(5). The municipality shall do 1 or more of the following with the proceeds of the tax levy:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Deposit in the debt retirement fund established for the municipal securities and used to pay debt service charges or obligations on municipal securities or agreements described in section 317(5).</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   Use to reimburse the municipality for any advances of funds used for the purposes described in subparagraph (i) or (ii).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Subsection (1) does not limit the amount required to be levied in a year for the purposes prescribed in that subsection, by the terms of an ordinance or resolution authorizing the issuance of the municipal securities.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the municipal securities were authorized or issued before December 23, 1978, or were approved by the electors of a municipality, the municipality shall levy the full amount of taxes required by this section for the payment of the municipal securities without limitation as to rate or amount and in addition to other taxes that the municipality may be authorized to levy. If the municipal securities were authorized or issued by a municipality after December 22, 1978, and were not approved by the electors of the municipality, the municipality shall set aside each year from the levy and collection of ad valorem taxes as required by this section as a first budget obligation for the payment of the municipal securities. However, the ad valorem taxes shall be subject to applicable charter, statutory, or constitutional rate limitations.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If there is surplus money on hand for the payment of principal or interest at the time of making an annual tax levy, and provision has not been made in the authorizing resolution for the disposition of that money, the annual levy for principal or interest shall be adjusted to reflect available funds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Money remaining in a debt retirement fund from the levy of a tax or an account within a debt retirement fund from the levy of a tax after the retirement of all municipal securities payable from that fund shall be used in the following order of priority:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   To pay other outstanding unlimited tax full faith and credit municipal securities.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   To pay other outstanding limited tax full faith and credit municipal securities.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   To be deposited in the general fund of the municipality.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   As taxes are collected, there shall be set aside that portion of the collections that is allocable to the payment of the principal and interest on the municipal securities. The portion set aside shall be divided pro rata among the various sinking funds and debt retirement funds in accordance with the amount levied for that purpose. Tax collections paid into a debt retirement fund, if the fund is for the payment of more than 1 issue of municipal securities, shall be allocated on the books and records of the municipality between the various issues in accordance with the amounts levied for that purpose.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   An officer who willfully fails to perform duties required by this section is personally liable to the municipality or to a holder of a municipal security for loss or damage arising from his or her failure.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a municipality fails to pay any installment of principal or interest on an outstanding municipal security on or before its due date, the state treasurer, for a municipality other than a school district, or the superintendent of public instruction, for a school district, may take that action it considers advisable to investigate the municipality's fiscal affairs, may consult with the governing body of the municipality, and may negotiate with the municipality's creditors in order to assist the municipality in developing a plan for financing, adjusting, or compromising the outstanding municipal security for which a payment of an installment of principal or interest had not been paid. As a component of a plan for financing the outstanding municipal security that has been defaulted upon, the department may agree and shall have the power to withhold all or part of state payments under an appropriation made to the municipality, the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921, or the state school aid act of 1979, 1979 PA 94, MCL 388.1601 to 388.1772, that the municipality is entitled to receive and to use these withheld amounts to pay unpaid amounts or subsequently due amounts, or both, of principal and interest on the outstanding municipal security.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 821.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Beginning March 1, 2002 and ending April 30, 2002, a municipality planning to issue a municipal security may do either of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Seek approval or exception from prior approval of the municipal security from the department in accordance with sections 10 and 11 of chapter III of the municipal finance act, 1943 PA 202, MCL 133.10 and 133.11.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Seek qualified status in accordance with section 303, by filing a qualifying statement referencing the most recent audit report of the municipality previously filed with the department prior to the effective date of this act, or if not previously timely filed, by attaching a copy of the audit report for the most recently completed fiscal year for which an audit has been completed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a municipality elects to seek qualified status as described in subsection (1) during the period between March 1, 2002 and May 1, 2002, the department shall determine within 30 business days of receipt of the qualifying statement whether the municipality complies with the requirements of section 303(3). If the department determines that the municipality complies with the provisions of section 303(3) or if the department fails to notify the municipality of its determination under this subsection within 30 business days of receipt of the qualifying statement, the municipality may proceed to issue municipal securities in accordance with this act without further approval from the department until 30 business days after the next qualifying statement is due or received by the department, whichever occurs first.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a municipality is not granted qualified status pursuant to subsection (2), or if a municipality does not file a qualifying statement as described in subsection (1), the municipality shall comply with section 303(7) for each municipal security issued until the municipality obtains qualified status based on the audit report and qualifying statement next duly filed by the municipality in accordance with section 303.</DIV>
