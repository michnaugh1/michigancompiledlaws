</P>
<P>Sec. 2.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The legislature finds:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That forestry operations are valuable to the state's economy, provide jobs to its citizens, can be an effective wildlife management tool, are essential to the manufacture of forestry products that are used and enjoyed by the people of the state, and benefit the general welfare of the people of the state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   That forestry operations are adversely affected by the random encroachment of urban and residential land uses throughout rural areas of the state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   That, as a result of random encroachment, conflicts have arisen between traditional forestry land uses and urban and residential land uses.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   That conflicts between forestry and urban land uses threaten to permanently convert forestland to other uses, whereby the forestland resources are permanently lost to the economy and the human and physical environments of the state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   That it is in the best interest of the state to ensure that forestry operations using generally accepted forestry management practices are not subject to public and private nuisance actions arising out of conflicts between the forestry operations and urban and residential land uses.</DIV>
