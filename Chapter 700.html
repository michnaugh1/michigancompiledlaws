A disposition, however, does not include a disclaimer, release, or relinquishment of property that was previously the subject of a qualified disposition. For purposes of this subdivision, as between a given trustee and a given beneficiary, a new fiduciary relation is created whenever the terms of the governing trust instrument are materially altered including alteration by an election described in section 5(6) with respect to the trust beneficiary in question. </div>

Investment decision also includes decisions regarding other transactions affecting the ownership of or rights in any trust property, other than distribution decisions.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) A disposition is not a qualified disposition if a transferor or any person that is related or subordinate to the transferor within the meaning of section 672(c) of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 672(c), may act as an advisor. For the purposes of this subparagraph, act as an advisor does not include the power to direct the investment decisions of the trust, the power to veto a distribution from the trust, or the right to remove a trustee or advisor and to appoint a new trustee or advisor.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the claim arose concurrent with or after the qualified disposition, 2 years after the qualified disposition was made.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the trust beneficiary is not the transferor of the qualified disposition, the trust beneficiary's interest in the qualified disposition or in property that is the subject of the qualified disposition is not considered marital property, is not considered, directly or indirectly, part of the trust beneficiary's real or personal estate, and shall not be awarded to the trust beneficiary's spouse in a judgment for annulment of a marriage, divorce, or separate maintenance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the trust beneficiary is the transferor of the qualified disposition, the trust beneficiary's interest in the qualified disposition or in property that is the subject of the qualified disposition is not considered marital property, is not considered, directly or indirectly, part of the trust beneficiary's real or personal estate, and shall not be awarded to the trust beneficiary's spouse in a judgment for annulment of a marriage, divorce, or separate maintenance if either of the following apply:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The requirements of a qualified disposition. If the property that is subject to the qualified disposition was first transferred to the trustee making the disposition or the predecessor trustee before the effective date of this act in a form that would otherwise meet the requirements of a qualified disposition, the qualified disposition is considered to have been made as of the effective date of this act.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The requirements of section 2(p)(ii).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a trustee of an existing trust proposes to make a disposition that, but for the exercise of authority granted in this subsection, would not be a qualified disposition because of a nonconforming power of appointment of the transferor, the trustee may modify the trust instrument by delivering to the qualified trustee an irrevocable written election to modify the nonconforming power of appointment to conform to the requirements of section 4(2)(c) or section 4(2)(k). An irrevocable written election described in this section must include both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A description of the modified power of appointment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The transferor's written consent to the modification. The transferor's consent is not a disposition.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The trustee of a trust that is the subject of a qualified disposition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An advisor of a trust that is the subject of a qualified disposition.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) With respect to a prior qualified disposition, both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The making of a subsequent qualified disposition is disregarded in determining whether a creditor's claim is extinguished as provided in subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The making of a subsequent qualified disposition is disregarded in determining, as provided in subsection (4), whether a trust beneficiary's interest in a qualified disposition or in property that is the subject of a qualified disposition is considered marital property, is considered part of a trust beneficiary's real or personal estate, or may be awarded to the trust beneficiary's spouse in a judgment for annulment of a marriage, divorce, or separate maintenance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A distribution to a trust beneficiary is considered to have been made from the most recent qualified disposition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) In an action against a trustee that received property in a qualified disposition, if a court takes any action declining to apply the law of this state in determining the validity, construction, or administration of the trust, or the effect of a spendthrift provision in the trust instrument, the trustee shall immediately on the court's action, and without the further order of any court, cease in all respects to be trustee of the trust. The former trustee does not have any power described in section 4(2) except to convey the trust property to the successor trustee and, at the former trustee's election, to petition the court for appointment of a successor trustee and collect its attorney fees, costs, and expenses. If the trust instrument does not provide for a successor trustee and the trust would otherwise be without a trustee, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The probate court, on the request of a qualified trust beneficiary of the trust, shall appoint a successor trustee on the terms and conditions it determines to be consistent with the purposes of the trust and this act. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A former trustee may, but has no duty to, petition the probate court to appoint a successor trustee if a petition for appointment of a successor trustee is not brought by a qualified trust beneficiary within 30 days after the date on which the former trustee ceases to be a trustee of the trust. If the former trustee elects to petition for the appointment of a successor trustee, the former trustee is entitled to reimbursement for all attorney fees, costs, and expenses associated with the petition, and the amount of the attorney fees, costs, and expenses is a lien against the trust's property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A valid lien attaching to property before a qualified disposition of the property survives the disposition, and the trustee takes title to the property subject to the valid lien and the trustee is subject to any agreements that created or perfected the valid lien.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A written agreement between a transferor and a creditor may provide for any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The transferor will have a continuing or periodic obligation to disclose any qualified dispositions to the creditor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A qualified disposition will require the prior written approval of the creditor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) That the transferor is under those other obligations as the creditor may require with respect to qualified dispositions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If a transfer that would otherwise be a qualified disposition violates an agreement with a creditor described in subsection (11), with respect to the creditor only, the transfer is not a qualified disposition and this act does not affect the rights of the creditor.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>700.1047 Avoidance of qualified disposition.</B><P>Sec. 7.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A qualified disposition may be avoided only to the extent necessary to satisfy or provide for the present value, taking into consideration any uncertainty of the transferor's debt to the creditor at whose instance the disposition had been avoided.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If all or any portion of a qualified disposition is avoided as provided in subsection (1), all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the court is satisfied that a trustee has not acted in bad faith in accepting or administering the property that is the subject of the qualified disposition, both of the following apply: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The trustee has a lien against the property that is the subject of the qualified disposition in an amount equal to the entire cost, including attorney fees, incurred by the trustee in the defense of an action to avoid the qualified disposition. The lien has priority over all other liens against the property, whether or not the other liens accrued or were recorded before the accrual of the lien created by this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The qualified disposition is avoided subject to the fees, costs, preexisting rights, claims, and interests of the trustee and of any predecessor trustee that has not acted in bad faith.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the court is satisfied that a trust beneficiary has not acted in bad faith, the avoidance of the qualified disposition is subject to the right of the trust beneficiary to retain any distribution received before the creditor's commencement of an action to avoid the qualified disposition. It is presumed that the trust beneficiary, including a trust beneficiary who is also a transferor of the trust, did not act in bad faith merely by creating the trust or by accepting a distribution made under the terms of the trust. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For purposes of this subsection, it is presumed that a trustee did not act in bad faith merely by accepting the property, with or without a qualified affidavit, or by making any distribution under the terms of the trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A creditor has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that a trustee or trust beneficiary acted in bad faith as required under subsection (2), except that, for a trust beneficiary who is also the transferor, the burden on the creditor is to prove that the transferor-beneficiary acted in bad faith by a preponderance of the evidence. This subsection provides substantive not procedural rights.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) With respect to a qualified disposition, a levy, attachment, garnishment, notice of lien, sequestration, or other legal or equitable process is permitted only in those circumstances permitted by this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act or section 13 of the powers of appointment act of 1967, 1967 PA 224, MCL 556.123, a creditor does not have a right against the interest of a trust beneficiary in a trust or portion of a trust that was a qualified disposition solely because the trust beneficiary has the right to authorize or direct the trustee to pay all or part of the trust property in satisfaction of estate or inheritance taxes imposed on or with respect to the trust beneficiary's postdeath estate, or the debts of the trust beneficiary's postdeath estate, or the expenses of administering the trust beneficiary's postdeath estate, unless the trust beneficiary actually directs the payment of the taxes, debts, or expenses, and then only to the extent of the direction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Except as otherwise provided in the trust instrument, if a married couple make a qualified disposition of property and, immediately before the qualified disposition, the property, any part of the property, or any accumulation to the property was, under applicable law, owned by the married couple as tenants by the entireties, then notwithstanding the qualified disposition, the property, any part of the property, or any accumulation to the property is, while held in trust during the lifetime of both spouses, treated as though it were tenancy by the entireties property. In an action concerning whether a creditor of either or both spouses may recover the debt from the trust, on avoidance of the qualified disposition, the sole remedy available to the creditor with respect to trust property treated as though it were tenancy by the entireties property is an order directing the trustee to transfer the property to both spouses as tenants by the entireties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (6), on avoidance of a qualified disposition to the extent permitted under subsection (1), the sole remedy available to the creditor is an order directing the trustee to transfer to the transferor the amount necessary to satisfy the transferor's debt to the creditor at whose instance the disposition has been avoided.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A trust beneficiary does not have the power or capacity to transfer any of the income from a trust or portion of a trust that is a qualified disposition by his or her order, voluntary or involuntary, or by an order or direction of a court. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in this act, the interest of a beneficiary in a trust or portion of a trust that is a qualified disposition is not subject to a process of attachment issued against the beneficiary, and may not be taken in execution under any form of legal process directed against the beneficiary, trustee, trust estate, or any part of the income of the trust estate, but the whole of the trust estate and the income of the trust estate must go to and be applied by the trustee solely for the benefit of the beneficiary, free, clear, and discharged of and from all obligations of the beneficiary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The trustee of a qualified disposition shall disregard and oppose an assignment or other act, voluntary or involuntary, that is attempted contrary to this section. The trustee is entitled to reimbursement for all attorney fees, costs, and expenses associated with carrying out this duty, and the amount of the attorney fees, costs, and expenses is a lien against the property that is the subject of the qualified disposition. A trustee is not liable, and a trust beneficiary or any successor trust beneficiary does not have a claim or cause of action against a trustee, for a breach of this duty unless the trustee's breach was in bad faith or the result of reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the trust beneficiaries.</div>

<P>Sec. 1205.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The court may order a person to appear before the court and be examined upon the matter of a complaint that is filed with the court under oath by a fiduciary, beneficiary, creditor, or another interested person of a decedent's or ward's trust or estate alleging any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The person is suspected of having, or has knowledge that another may have, concealed, embezzled, conveyed away, or disposed of the trustee's, decedent's, or ward's property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The person has possession or knowledge of a deed, conveyance, bond, contract, or other writing that contains evidence of, or tends to disclose, the right, title, interest, or claim of the trustee, decedent, or ward to any of the trust or estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The person has possession or knowledge of a decedent's last will.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the person ordered under subsection (1) refuses to appear and be examined, or refuses to answer the interrogatories asked of the person that relate to the complaint, the judge may by warrant commit the person to the county jail to remain in custody until that person submits to the order of the court.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In addition to the rules of evidence in courts of general jurisdiction, the court shall determine death or status in accordance with the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Death occurs when an individual is determined to be dead under the determination of death act, 1992 PA 90, MCL 333.1031 to 333.1034.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A certified or authenticated copy of a death certificate purporting to be issued by an official or agency of the place where the death purportedly occurred is prima facie evidence of the decedent's identity and of the fact, place, date, and time of the decedent's death.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A certified or authenticated copy of a record or report of a governmental agency, domestic or foreign, that an individual is missing, detained, dead, or alive is prima facie evidence of the individual's status and of the dates, circumstances, and places disclosed by the record or report.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   In the absence of prima facie evidence of death under subdivision (b) or (c), the fact of death may be established by clear and convincing evidence, including circumstantial evidence.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   A certified copy of an order issued under this section is sufficient when presented to the medical examiner for the preparation of a certificate of death.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The procedure to establish the death of an individual who is an accident or disaster victim and whose remains have disappeared or are unidentifiable is as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If an accident or disaster occurs that apparently causes the death of the individual described in this section, any of the following individuals may petition the court for a determination of the cause and date of the presumed decedent's death:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Venue for a proceeding under this section is in 1 of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The court in a county in which the accident or disaster or any part of the accident or disaster occurs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   If the accident or disaster occurs upon or within the Great Lakes or their connecting waters, the court in a county adjacent to the scene of the accident or disaster.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   If the accident or disaster did not occur in Michigan or adjoining waters, the court in the county of the presumed decedent's domicile.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A petition to determine the cause and date of death as provided in this section shall not be filed less than 63 days or more than 7 years after the occurrence of the accident or disaster.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A petition under this section shall set forth the facts and circumstances concerning the accident or disaster, the reasons for the belief that the presumed decedent died in the accident or disaster, that the presumed decedent has disappeared or is unidentifiable, and the names and addresses of all individuals known or believed to be heirs at law of the presumed decedent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Upon the filing of a petition under this section, the court shall fix the time and place for a hearing. The petitioner shall give or cause to be given notice of the hearing as provided by supreme court rule.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In the absence of evidence disputing the time of death stated on a document described in section 1207(b), (c), or (g), a document described in section 1207(b), (c), or (g) that states a time of death 120 hours or more after the time of death of another individual, however the time of death of the other individual is determined, establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the individual survived the other individual by 120 hours.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) This section does not apply to a provision in a governing instrument appointing the attorney who drafted the governing instrument, or a person related to the attorney who drafted the governing instrument, as a fiduciary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A provision in a governing instrument purporting to waive or otherwise avoid the application of this section is unenforceable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a purchaser or lender for value acquires property distributed in kind or a security interest in property from a person that has received a substantial gift pursuant to a part of a governing instrument that is void under subsection (1), the purchaser or lender takes title free of any claims arising under, and incurs no personal liability by reason of, this section. This section does not directly or indirectly impose liability on a person that honors or relies on a part of a governing instrument that is void under subsection (1) and that contains or effectuates a substantial gift, unless the person has knowledge that the part of the governing instrument is void.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a part of a governing instrument is void under subsection (1), the part that is void is severable and does not affect any other part of the governing instrument that can be given effect, including a term that makes an alternate or substitute gift. If the part of the governing instrument that is void under subsection (1) cannot be severed, the entire governing instrument is void. For a power of appointment, this section does not affect the power to appoint in favor of persons other than the attorney who drafted the governing instrument or a person related to the attorney who drafted the governing instrument.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the court determines that an attorney who drafted the governing instrument disguised or attempted to disguise a substantial gift, to the attorney who drafted the governing instrument or a person related to the attorney who drafted the governing instrument, as a conveyance for consideration for less than fair market value, the court may find the conveyance void under subsection (1). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The rights and remedies granted in this section are in addition to any other rights or remedies a person may have at law. A part of a governing instrument that is not void under subsection (1) may be challenged under other legal grounds.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) For purposes of this section, a person is related to an individual if, at the time the attorney who drafted the governing instrument prepared or supervised the preparation or execution of the governing instrument, the person is any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A spouse of the individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A lineal ascendant or descendant of the individual or the individual's spouse.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A spouse of the individual described in subdivision (b) or (c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) For purposes of this section, an organization is related to an attorney if the attorney owns a 50% or greater interest in the organization or otherwise controls the organization.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Attorney who drafted the governing instrument" means an individual to whom both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The individual is or was licensed to practice law in this state or any other state, before or at the time the governing instrument was prepared or executed, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The individual directly or indirectly prepared or supervised the preparation, execution, or both, of the governing instrument. For purposes of this subparagraph, among other ways, the individual is considered to have prepared, or supervised the execution of, the governing instrument if the preparation, or supervision of the execution, of the governing instrument was performed by an employee, subordinate, partner, co-owner, or other person or lawyer employed by the same firm or company as the individual as of the time of preparation or execution, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Gift" includes an inter vivos gift, a testamentary transfer of property, and the power to make the testamentary transfer regardless of any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Whether the gift or testamentary transfer is outright or in trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) When the gift or testamentary transfer is to take effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Whether the power is held in a fiduciary or nonfiduciary capacity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Substantial gift" means a gift, the value of which exceeds $5,000.00 as a result of a single governing instrument or 2 or more related governing instruments.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) An order that binds a conservator, plenary guardian, or partial guardian binds the estate that the conservator, plenary guardian, or partial guardian controls. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) A minor, incapacitated, or unborn individual or a person whose identity or location is unknown and not reasonably ascertainable and who is not otherwise represented is bound by an order that binds another party that has a substantially identical interest in the proceeding, but only to the extent there is no conflict of interest between the representation and the person represented.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Notice is required as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Notice as prescribed by section 1401 shall be given to every interested person or to one who can bind an interested person as described in subdivision (b)(i) or (ii). Notice may be given both to a person and to another who may bind the person.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) At any point in a proceeding, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interest of a minor, an incapacitated individual, an unborn or unascertained person, or a person whose identity or address is unknown, if the court determines that representation of the interest otherwise would be inadequate. If not precluded by a conflict of interest, a guardian ad litem may be appointed to represent several persons or interests. The court shall set out the reasons for appointing a guardian ad litem as a part of the record of the proceeding. If he or she accepts the appointment, the guardian ad litem shall report of his or her investigation and recommendation concerning the matters for which he or she is appointed in writing or recorded testimony. In making recommendations, a guardian ad litem may consider the general benefit accruing to living members of the individual's family. After the attorney general files an appearance as required by law in an estate proceeding on behalf of an unknown or unascertained heir at law, the attorney general represents the interest of the heir at law, and the court shall not appoint a guardian ad litem. If a guardian ad litem was previously appointed for the interest, the appointment of the guardian ad litem terminates.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in subsections (2), (3), and (4), for purposes of intestate succession by, through, or from an individual, an individual is the child of his or her natural parents, regardless of their marital status. The parent and child relationship may be established in any of the following manners:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If a child is born or conceived during a marriage, both spouses are presumed to be the natural parents of the child for purposes of intestate succession. A child conceived by a married woman with the consent of her husband following utilization of assisted reproductive technology is considered as their child for purposes of intestate succession. Consent of the husband is presumed unless the contrary is shown by clear and convincing evidence. If a man and a woman participated in a marriage ceremony in apparent compliance with the law before the birth of a child, even though the attempted marriage may be void, the child is presumed to be their child for purposes of intestate succession.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If a child is born out of wedlock or if a child is born or conceived during a marriage but is not the issue of that marriage, a man is considered to be the child's natural father for purposes of intestate succession if any of the following occur:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The man joins with the child's mother and acknowledges that child as his child by completing an acknowledgment of parentage as prescribed in the acknowledgment of parentage act, 1996 PA 305, MCL 722.1001 to 722.1013.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The man joins the mother in a written request for a correction of certificate of birth pertaining to the child that results in issuance of a substituted certificate recording the child's birth.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The man and child have established a mutually acknowledged relationship of parent and child that begins before the child becomes age 18 and continues until terminated by the death of either.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The man is determined to be the child's father and an order of filiation establishing that paternity is entered as provided in the paternity act, 1956 PA 205, MCL 722.711 to 722.730.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Regardless of the child's age or whether or not the alleged father has died, the court with jurisdiction over probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estate determines that the man is the child's father, using the standards and procedures established under the paternity act, 1956 PA 205, MCL 722.711 to 722.730.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) The man is determined to be the father in an action under the revocation of paternity act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A child who is not conceived or born during a marriage is an individual born in wedlock if the child's parents marry after the conception or birth of the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An adopted individual is the child of his or her adoptive parent or parents and not of his or her natural parents, but adoption of a child by the spouse of either natural parent has no effect on either the relationship between the child and that natural parent or the right of the child or a descendant of the child to inherit from or through the other natural parent. An individual is considered to be adopted for purposes of this subsection when a court of competent jurisdiction enters an interlocutory decree of adoption that is not vacated or reversed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The permanent termination of parental rights of a minor child by an order of a court of competent jurisdiction; by a release for purposes of adoption given by the parent, but not a guardian, to the family independence agency or a licensed child placement agency, or before a probate or juvenile court; or by any other process recognized by the law governing the parent-child status at the time of termination, excepting termination by emancipation or death, ends kinship between the parent whose rights are so terminated and the child for purposes of intestate succession by that parent from or through that child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Inheritance from or through a child by either natural parent or his or her kindred is precluded unless that natural parent has openly treated the child as his or hers, and has not refused to support the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Only the individual presumed to be the natural parent of a child under subsection (1)(a) may disprove a presumption that is relevant to that parent and child relationship, and this exclusive right to disprove the presumption terminates on the death of the presumed parent.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That the spouse will abide by the terms of the will.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The surviving spouse electing under subsection (1) is limited to 1 choice. Unless the testator's will plainly shows a contrary intent, the surviving spouse electing under subsection (2) is limited to 1 choice. The right of election of the surviving spouse under this section must be exercised during the lifetime of the surviving spouse. The election must be made within 63 days after the date for presentment of claims or within 63 days after service of the inventory upon the surviving spouse, whichever is later.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Notice of right of election must be served on the decedent's spouse, if any, as provided in section 3705(5), and proof of that notice must be filed with the court. An election as provided by this section may be filed instead of service of notice and filing of proof.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) For a legally incapacitated person, the right of election may be exercised only by order of the court in which a proceeding as to that person's property is pending, after finding that exercise is necessary to provide adequate support for the legally incapacitated person during that person's life expectancy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The surviving spouse of a decedent who was not domiciled in this state is entitled to election against the intestate estate or against the will only as may be provided by the law of the place in which the decedent was domiciled at the time of death.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Property devised to or in trust for the benefit of a child of the testator who was born before the testator married the surviving spouse and who is not the surviving spouse's child.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as provided in subsection (2), if a testator fails to provide in his or her will for a child of the testator born or adopted after the execution of the will, the omitted after-born or after-adopted child receives a share in the estate as provided in 1 of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the testator had no child living when he or she executed the will, an omitted after-born or after-adopted child receives a share in the estate equal in value to that which the child would have received had the testator died intestate, unless the will devised all or substantially all of the estate to the other parent of the omitted child and that other parent survives the testator and is entitled to take under the will.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the testator had 1 or more children living when he or she executed the will, and the will devised property or an interest in property to 1 or more of the then-living children, an omitted after-born or after-adopted child is entitled to share in the testator's estate subject to all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The portion of the testator's estate in which the omitted after-born or after-adopted child is entitled to share is limited to devises made to the testator's then-living children under the will.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   The omitted after-born or after-adopted child is entitled to receive the share of the testator's estate, as limited in subparagraph (i), that the child would have received had the testator included all omitted after-born and after-adopted children with the children to whom devises were made under the will and had given an equal share of the estate to each child.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   To the extent feasible, the interest granted an omitted after-born or after-adopted child under this section must be of the same character, whether equitable or legal, present or future, as that devised to the testator's then-living children under the will.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)   In satisfying a share provided by this subdivision, devises to the testator's children who were living when the will was executed abate ratably. In abating the devises of the then-living children, the court shall preserve to the maximum extent possible the character of the testamentary plan adopted by the testator.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Subsection (1) does not apply if either of the following applies:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   It appears from the will that the omission was intentional.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The testator provided for the omitted after-born or after-adopted child by transfer outside the will and the intent that the transfer be a substitute for a testamentary provision is shown by the testator's statements or is reasonably inferred from the amount of the transfer or other evidence.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If at the time of execution of the will the testator fails to provide in his or her will for a living child solely because he or she believes the child to be dead, the child is entitled to share in the estate as if the child were an omitted after-born or after-adopted child.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2402.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A decedent's surviving spouse is entitled to a homestead allowance of $15,000.00, adjusted as provided in section 1210. If there is no surviving spouse, each minor child and each dependent child of the decedent is entitled to a homestead allowance equal to $15,000.00, adjusted as provided in section 1210, divided by the number of the decedent's minor and dependent children. The homestead allowance is exempt from and has priority over all claims against the estate, except administration costs and expenses and reasonable funeral and burial expenses. A homestead allowance is in addition to any share passing to the surviving spouse or minor or dependent child by the will of the decedent, unless otherwise provided, by intestate succession, or by elective share.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2403.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   For their maintenance during the period of administration, a reasonable family allowance is payable to the decedent's surviving spouse and minor children whom the decedent was obligated to support, and children of the decedent or another who were in fact being supported by the decedent, which allowance shall not continue for longer than 1 year if the estate is inadequate to discharge allowed claims. The family allowance may be paid in a lump sum or in periodic installments. The family allowance is payable to the surviving spouse, if living, for the use of the surviving spouse and minor and dependent children; otherwise to the children or persons having their care and custody. If a minor child or dependent child is not living with the surviving spouse, the allowance may be paid partially to the child or to a fiduciary or other person having the child's care and custody, and partially to the spouse, as their needs may appear.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The family allowance is exempt from and has priority over all claims except administration costs and expenses, reasonable funeral and burial expenses, and the homestead allowance. The family allowance is not chargeable against a benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or children by the will of the decedent, unless otherwise provided, by intestate succession, or by way of elective share. The death of an individual entitled to family allowance terminates the right to allowances not yet paid.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The decedent's surviving spouse is also entitled to household furniture, automobiles, furnishings, appliances, and personal effects from the estate up to a value not to exceed $10,000.00 more than the amount of any security interests to which the property is subject. If there is no surviving spouse, the decedent's children who are not excluded under subsection (4) are entitled jointly to the same value.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If encumbered assets are selected and the value in excess of security interests, plus that of other exempt property, is less than $10,000.00, or if there is not $10,000.00 worth of exempt property in the estate, the spouse or children who are not excluded under subsection (4) are entitled to other assets of the estate, if any, to the extent necessary to make up the $10,000.00 value. Rights to exempt property and assets needed to make up a deficiency of exempt property have priority over all claims against the estate, except that the right to assets to make up a deficiency of exempt property abates as necessary to permit payment of all of the following in the following order:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The decedent may exclude 1 or more of the decedent's children from receiving exempt property or assets to make up a deficiency of exempt property under subsection (1) by either of the following means: </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The child takes nothing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The child takes an amount of $10.00 or less from the estate.</div>

The personal representative may determine the family allowance in a lump sum not exceeding $18,000.00, adjusted as provided in section 1210, or periodic installments not exceeding 1/12 of that amount per month for 1 year, and may disburse funds of the estate in payment of the family allowance and any part of the homestead allowance payable in cash.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2507.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A will or a part of a will is revoked by either of the following acts:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Execution of a subsequent will that revokes the previous will or a part of the will expressly or by inconsistency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Performance of a revocatory act on the will, if the testator performed the act with the intent and for the purpose of revoking the will or a part of the will or if another individual performed the act in the testator's conscious presence and by the testator's direction. For purposes of this subdivision, "revocatory act on the will" includes burning, tearing, canceling, obliterating, or destroying the will or a part of the will. A burning, tearing, or canceling is a revocatory act on the will, whether or not the burn, tear, or cancellation touches any of the words on the will.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a subsequent will does not expressly revoke a previous will, the execution of the subsequent will wholly revokes the previous will by inconsistency if the testator intended the subsequent will to replace rather than supplement the previous will.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The testator is presumed to have intended a subsequent will to replace rather than supplement a previous will if the subsequent will makes a complete disposition of the testator's estate. If this presumption arises and is not rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, the previous will is revoked, and only the subsequent will is operative on the testator's death.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The testator is presumed to have intended a subsequent will to supplement rather than replace a previous will if the subsequent will does not make a complete disposition of the testator's estate. If this presumption arises and is not rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, the subsequent will revokes the previous will only to the extent the subsequent will is inconsistent with the previous will, and each will is fully operative on the testator's death to the extent they are not inconsistent.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A safe deposit box of which the decedent was an individual or joint lessee may be opened following the decedent's death only upon compliance with the Michigan estate tax act, 1899 PA 188, MCL 205.201 to 205.256.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A safe deposit box of the decedent who was an individual or joint lessee and for whom a fiduciary was appointed may be opened by that fiduciary in a like manner as provided by the Michigan estate tax act, 1899 PA 188, MCL 205.201 to 205.256, as it relates to deceased individuals.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In the estate of a decedent who dies after September 30, 1993, the following apply to the opening of a safe deposit box:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Whenever it appears to the court by petition of an interested person that a safe and collateral deposit company, trust company, corporation, bank, or other institution has leased to a decedent, either as an individual or joint lessee, a safe deposit box in the county in which the probate court has jurisdiction and that the safe deposit box may contain a will of the decedent or a deed to a burial plot in which the decedent is to be interred, the court may issue an order directing the institution to permit the person named in the order to examine the safe deposit box in the presence of an officer or other authorized employee of the institution. If a paper purporting to be a will of the decedent or a deed to a burial plot is found in the box, the person named in the order shall deliver the will or deed to the probate register or his or her deputy. The probate register or his or her deputy shall furnish a receipt to the person named in the order. An item contained in the safe deposit box other than the will or deed shall not be removed from the safe deposit box. At the time of the opening of the safe deposit box, all individuals in attendance shall execute a written statement certifying whether a will or deed to a burial plot is found and that no other items are removed, which statement shall be delivered within 7 days after execution to the probate register or his or her deputy. Before the court enters the order, there shall be paid to the probate register a fee of $10.00, which shall be credited to the general fund of the county. If the decedent's estate is administered in a probate court in the state, the party making payment of the fee may file a claim in the estate for that amount, which shall be charged as a cost of administration.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The safe deposit box of an individual who is an individual or joint lessee and for whom a fiduciary was appointed may be opened by that fiduciary and its contents removed. If the safe deposit box is jointly leased, then the fiduciary may examine the safe deposit box only in the presence of an officer or other authorized employee of the safe deposit and collateral company, trust company, corporation, bank, or other institution. At the time of the opening of the safe deposit box, all individuals in attendance shall execute a written statement certifying as to what is removed from the box by the fiduciary. The fiduciary shall serve a copy of that statement on the other joint lessees within 7 days after removing the items.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Notwithstanding another provision of this section, a surviving joint lessee of a joint safe deposit box has full access to the safe deposit box.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Descendants" means your children, grandchildren, and their descendants.</div>

Each living descendant of the nearest degree will receive 1 share. The remaining shares, if any, are combined and then divided in the same manner among the surviving descendants of the deceased descendants as if the surviving descendants who were allocated a share and their surviving descendants had predeceased the descendant. In this manner, all descendants who are in the same generation will take an equal share.</div>

Allegan“Lansing, MI 48918-9900“Dear Secretary Miller:“The purpose of this letter is to document the action I am taking in order to correct a clerical error recently detected in Enrolled Senate Bill 1045. I signed this bill on March 29, 2000. It was filed with the Secretary of State on March 30, 2000, and assigned Public Act Number 54 of 2000. This legislation made various, largely technical amendments to the Estates and Protected Individuals Code that, having been given immediate effect, took effect on April 1, 2000.“The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House re-presented a corrected version of Enrolled Senate Bill 1045 to me on September 11, 2000, along with the accompanying letter. Apparently, a clerical error was made during the enrollment process. Specifically, Section 2519, which updated the year '19 __' to '20__' on the Michigan statutory will form was inadvertently omitted from the bill. During the 6 months this error remained undetected, an unknown and unknowable number of persons may have relied on its provisions, all but one of which are unaffected by this correction which, in effect, makes a century date change.“The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House have recommended that I now re-sign a corrected version to be assigned the same date and public act number of the originally signed bill. Michigan case law supports this recommended procedure due to the fact that the omission was a 'clerical mistake' that dealt with a non-substantive provision of the bill.“As the court held in Board of Control v Auditor General, 149 Mich 386, 388 (1907), '(an) omission in the enrolled bill of words not essential to its substance or effect will not render the act invalid.' Similar decisions can be found in more recent court opinions. Beacon Club v Kalamazoo Sheriff, 332 Mich 412 (1952).“Therefore, I have affixed the revised enrolled bill with the same date as the date of my original signature. In addition, it is my expectation that the corrected enrolled bill will receive Public Act Number 54 of 2000.“Sincerely,“John Engler“Governor“cc: Michigan State Senate“Michigan House of Representatives”“September 10, 2000“The Honorable John Engler“Capitol Building“Lansing, Michigan 48913“Subject: PA 54 of 2000“Dear Governor Engler:“A clerical error has been detected in Enrolled Senate Bill 1045, which was filed with the Secretary of State on March 30, 2000, and assigned Public Act No. 54 of 2000. The bill presented to you on March 29, 2000, did not accurately reflect what was agreed to by both houses of the Legislature. Specifically, Section 2519, which updated the year from '19 __' to '20__' on the Michigan statutory will form was inadvertently omitted from the bill.“Therefore, we are presenting a correct Enrolled Senate Bill for your signature and filing with the Secretary of State. Upon filing, the defective Enrolled Senate Bill 1045 will be replaced with the correct Enrolled Senate Bill 1045 and assigned the same public act number. The inaccurate enrolled bill was signed by you on March 29, 2000, and filed with the Secretary of State on March 30, 2000. The effective date of Public Act No. 54 of 2000 will remain April 1, 2000.“This procedure ensures that the bill as passed by both houses of the Legislature is accurately filed and effective, while this document will provide notification to the public. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you and the citizens of the state of Michigan.

</P>
<P>Sec. 2603.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a devisee fails to survive the testator and is a grandparent, a grandparent's descendant, or a stepchild of either the testator or the donor of a power of appointment exercised by the testator's will, the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Except as provided in subdivision (d), if the devise is not in the form of a class gift and the deceased devisee leaves surviving descendants, a substitute gift is created in the devisee's surviving descendants. Those surviving descendants take by representation the property to which the devisee would have been entitled had the devisee survived the testator.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Except as provided in subdivision (d), if the devise is in the form of a class gift, other than a devise to "issue", "descendants", "heirs of the body", "heirs", "next of kin", "relatives", or "family", or to a class described by language of similar import, a substitute gift is created in the surviving descendants of a deceased devisee. The property to which the devisee would have been entitled had all class members survived the testator passes to the surviving devisees and the deceased devisees' surviving descendants. Each surviving devisee takes the share to which he or she would have been entitled had the deceased devisees survived the testator. Each deceased devisee's surviving descendants who are substituted for the deceased devisee take by representation the share to which the deceased devisee would have been entitled had the deceased devisee survived the testator. For the purposes of this subdivision, "deceased devisee" means a class member who fails to survive the testator and leaves 1 or more surviving descendants.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   For the purposes of section 2602(1), words of survivorship, such as in a devise to an individual "if he survives me" or in a devise to "my surviving children", are not, in the absence of additional evidence, a sufficient indication of an intent contrary to the application of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   If the will creates an alternative devise with respect to a devise for which a substitute gift is created by subdivision (a) or (b), the substitute gift is superseded by the alternative devise only if an expressly designated devisee of the alternative devise is entitled to take under the will.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Unless the language creating a power of appointment expressly excludes the substitution of the appointee's descendants for the appointee, a surviving descendant of a deceased appointee of a power of appointment can be substituted for the appointee under this section, whether or not the descendant is an object of the power.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If, under subsection (1), substitute gifts are created and not superseded with respect to more than 1 devise and the devises are alternative devises, one to the other, the determination of which of the substitute gifts take effect is resolved as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Except as provided in subdivision (b), the devised property passes under the primary substitute gift.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If there is a younger-generation devise, the devised property passes under the younger-generation substitute gift and not under the primary substitute gift.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   As used in this section:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Primary devise" means the devise that would have taken effect had all the deceased devisees of the alternative devises who left surviving descendants survived the testator.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Primary substitute gift" means the substitute gift created with respect to the primary devise.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   "Younger-generation devise" means a devise for which all of the following are true:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Is to a descendant of a devisee of the primary devise.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Is an alternative devise with respect to the primary devise.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   Is a devise for which a substitute gift is created.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)   Would have taken effect had all the deceased devisees who left surviving descendants survived the testator except the deceased devisee or devisees of the primary devise.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   "Younger-generation substitute gift" means the substitute gift created with respect to the younger-generation devise.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A specific devisee has a right to the specifically devised property in the testator's estate at death and all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Any balance of the purchase price, together with any security agreement, owing from a purchaser to the testator at death by reason of sale of the property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Any amount of a condemnation award for the taking of the property unpaid at death.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Any proceeds unpaid at death on fire or casualty insurance on, or other recovery for, injury to the property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Property owned by the testator at death and acquired as a result of foreclosure, or obtained in lieu of foreclosure, of the security interest for a specifically devised obligation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Real property or tangible personal property owned by the testator at death that the testator acquired as a replacement for specifically devised real property or tangible personal property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Unless the facts and circumstances indicate that ademption of the devise was intended by the testator or ademption of the devise is consistent with the testator's manifested plan of distribution, the value of the specifically devised property to the extent the specifically devised property is not in the testator's estate at death and its value or its replacement is not covered by subdivisions (a) to (e).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If an agent acting within the authority of a durable power of attorney for an incapacitated principal or a conservator sells or mortgages specifically devised property, or if a condemnation award, insurance proceeds, or recovery for injury to the property are paid to an agent acting within the authority of a durable power of attorney for an incapacitated principal or to a conservator, the specific devisee has the right to a general pecuniary devise equal to the net sale price, the amount of the unpaid loan, the condemnation award, the insurance proceeds, or the recovery.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The right of a specific devisee under subsection (2) is reduced by a right the devisee has under subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   For the purposes of the references in subsection (2) to a conservator, subsection (2) does not apply if after the sale, mortgage, condemnation, casualty, or recovery, it was adjudicated that the testator's disability ceased and the testator survived the adjudication by 1 year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   For the purposes of the references in subsection (2) to an agent acting within the authority of a durable power of attorney for an incapacitated principal, an incapacitated principal is a principal who is an incapacitated individual, an adjudication of the individual's incapacity before death is not necessary, and the acts of an agent within the authority of a durable power of attorney are presumed to be for an incapacitated principal.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In the absence of a finding of a contrary intention, the rules of construction in this part control the construction of a governing instrument.

</P>
<P>Sec. 2702.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   For the purposes of this act, except as provided in subsection (4), an individual who is not established by clear and convincing evidence to have survived an event, including the death of another individual, by 120 hours is considered to have predeceased the event.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as provided in subsection (4), for purposes of a provision of a governing instrument that relates to an individual surviving an event, including the death of another individual, an individual who is not established by clear and convincing evidence to have survived the event by 120 hours is considered to have predeceased the event.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as provided in subsection (4), if it is not established by clear and convincing evidence that 1 of 2 co-owners with right of survivorship survived the other co-owner by 120 hours, 1/2 of the co-owned property passes as if 1 had survived by 120 hours and 1/2 as if the other had survived by 120 hours. If there are more than 2 co-owners and it is not established by clear and convincing evidence that at least 1 of them survived the others by 120 hours, the property passes in the proportion that 1 bears to the whole number of co-owners. For the purposes of this subsection, "co-owners with right of survivorship" includes joint tenants, tenants by the entireties, and other co-owners of property or accounts held under circumstances that entitles 1 or more to the whole of the property or account on the death of the other or others.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Survival by 120 hours is not required under any of the following circumstances:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The governing instrument contains language dealing explicitly with simultaneous deaths or deaths in a common disaster and that language is operable under the facts of the case. Language dealing explicitly with simultaneous deaths includes language in a governing instrument that creates a presumption that applies if the evidence is not sufficient to determine the order of deaths.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The governing instrument expressly indicates that an individual is not required to survive an event, including the death of another individual, by any specified period or expressly requires the individual to survive the event by a specified period. Survival of the event or the specified period, however, must be established by clear and convincing evidence.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The imposition of a 120-hour requirement of survival would cause a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment to fail to qualify for validity under section 2(1)(a), (2)(a), or (3)(a) of the uniform statutory rule against perpetuities, 1988 PA 418, MCL 554.72, or to become invalid under section 2(1)(b), (2)(b), or (3)(b) of the uniform statutory rule against perpetuities, 1988 PA 418, MCL 554.72.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The application of a 120-hour requirement of survival to multiple governing instruments would result in an unintended failure or duplication of a disposition. Survival, however, must be established by clear and convincing evidence.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2703.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a payor or other third party is not liable for having made a payment or transferred an item of property or another benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument who, under section 2702, is not entitled to the payment or item of property, or for having taken another action in reliance on the beneficiary's apparent entitlement under the terms of the governing instrument. A payor or other third party is liable for a payment made or other action taken 3 or more business days after the payor or other third party actually receives written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under section 2702. A payor or other third party is not obligated to inquire as to whether the 120-hour survival provision of section 2702 applies to any individual or to seek evidence regarding whether that provision applies to any individual. A recipient who incorrectly receives a payment, transfer of property, or other benefit is liable for the payment or transfer received, whether or not written notice of the claim is given.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under subsection (1) must be mailed to the payor's or other third party's main office or home by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or served upon the payor or other third party in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. Notice to a sales representative of a payor or other third party does not constitute notice to the payor or other third party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The written notice under subsection (1) must include the decedent's name, the name of the person asserting an interest, the nature of the payment, item of property, or other benefit, and a statement that the beneficiary designated in the governing instrument did not survive the decedent by 120 hours. Notice in a form or service in a manner other than that described in this section does not impose liability on a payor or other third party for an action taken in accordance with a governing instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Upon receipt of written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under section 2702, a payor or other third party may pay an amount owed to the county treasurer of the county of the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estate, or if proceedings have not been commenced, to the county treasurer of the county of the decedent's residence. With a payment under this section, the payor or other third party shall file a copy of the written notice received by the payor or other third party. A payment made to the county treasurer discharges the payor or other third party from all claims for the value of amounts paid to the county treasurer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The county treasurer shall not charge a filing fee for a payment to the county treasurer under this section. The county treasurer shall hold the money in accordance with section 3917 and, upon the court's determination under section 2702, shall disburse the money in accordance with the determination.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The provision for payment to the county treasurer under this section does not preclude a payor or other third party from taking another action authorized by law or the governing instrument.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   As used in this section and sections 2709 to 2712:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Alternative beneficiary designation" means a beneficiary designation that is expressly created by the governing instrument and, under the terms of the governing instrument, can take effect instead of another beneficiary designation on the happening of 1 or more events, including survival of the decedent or failure to survive the decedent, whether an event is expressed in condition-precedent, condition-subsequent, or another form.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Beneficiary" means the beneficiary of a beneficiary designation under which the beneficiary must survive the decedent. Beneficiary includes a class member if the beneficiary designation is in the form of a class gift; an individual or class member who was deceased at the time the beneficiary designation was executed; and an individual or class member who was then living but who failed to survive the decedent. Beneficiary excludes a joint tenant of a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship and a party to a joint and survivorship account.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If a beneficiary fails to survive the decedent and is a grandparent, a grandparent's descendant, or the decedent's stepchild, the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Except as provided in subdivision (d), if the beneficiary designation is not in the form of a class gift and the deceased beneficiary leaves surviving descendants, a substitute gift is created in the beneficiary's surviving descendants. They take by representation the property to which the beneficiary would have been entitled had the beneficiary survived the decedent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Except as provided in subdivision (d), if the beneficiary designation is in the form of a class gift, other than a beneficiary designation to "issue", "descendants", "heirs of the body", "heirs", "next of kin", "relatives", or "family" or a class described by language of similar import, a substitute gift is created in the surviving descendants of each deceased beneficiary. The property to which the beneficiaries would have been entitled had all of them survived the decedent passes to the surviving beneficiaries and the surviving descendants of the deceased beneficiaries. Each surviving beneficiary takes the share to which he or she would have been entitled had the deceased beneficiaries survived the decedent. Each deceased beneficiary's surviving descendants who are substituted for the deceased beneficiary take by representation the share to which the deceased beneficiary would have been entitled had the deceased beneficiary survived the decedent. For the purposes of this subdivision, "deceased beneficiary" means a class member who failed to survive the decedent and left 1 or more surviving descendants.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   For the purposes of section 2701, words of survivorship, such as in a beneficiary designation to an individual "if he survives me" or in a beneficiary designation to "my surviving children", are not, in the absence of additional evidence, a sufficient indication of an intent contrary to the application of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   If a governing instrument creates an alternative beneficiary designation with respect to a beneficiary designation for which a substitute gift is created by subdivision (a) or (b), the substitute gift is superseded by the alternative beneficiary designation only if an expressly designated beneficiary of the alternative beneficiary designation is entitled to take.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2711.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a payor or other third party is not liable for making a payment under the terms of a beneficiary designation. Payment made before the actual receipt of a written notice of a claim to a substitute gift discharges the payor or other third party, but not the recipient, from a claim for the amount paid. A payor or other third party is liable for a payment made 3 or more business days after the payor or other third party actually receives written notice of the claim. A payor or other third party is not obligated to inquire as to whether a substitute gift exists under sections 2709 and 2710 or to seek evidence regarding such a gift. A recipient who incorrectly receives a payment is liable for the payment received, whether or not written notice of the claim is given.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A written notice of a substitute claim must be mailed to the payor's or other third party's main office or home by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or served upon the payor or other third party in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. Notice to a sales representative of a payor or other third party does not constitute notice to the payor or other third party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The written notice under subsection (1) must include the decedent's name, the name of the person asserting an interest, the nature of the payment, item of property, or other benefit, and a statement that a claim to a substitute gift is being made under sections 2709 and 2710. Notice in a form or service in a manner other than that described in this section does not impose liability on a payor or other third party for an action taken in accordance with a governing instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Upon receipt of a written notice of the claim, a payor or other third party may pay any amount the payor or other third party owes to the county treasurer of the county of the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estate or, if no proceedings have been commenced, to the county treasurer of the county of the decedent's residence. With a payment under this section, the payor or other third party shall file a copy of the written notice received by the payor or other third party. A payment made to the county treasurer discharges the payor or other third party from all claims for the amount paid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The county treasurer shall not charge a filing fee for a payment to the county treasurer under this section. The county treasurer shall hold the money in accordance with section 3917 and, upon the court's determination under sections 2709 and 2710, shall disburse the money in accordance with the determination.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The provision for payment to the county treasurer under this section does not preclude a payor or other third party from taking another action authorized by law or the governing instrument.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   As used in this section and sections 2714 to 2716:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Alternative future interest" means an expressly created future interest that can take effect in possession or enjoyment instead of another future interest on the happening of 1 or more events, including survival of an event or failure to survive an event, whether an event is expressed in condition-precedent, condition-subsequent, or another form. A residuary clause in a will does not create an alternative future interest with respect to a future interest created in a nonresiduary devise in the will, whether or not the will specifically provides that a lapsed or failed devise is to pass under the residuary clause.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Beneficiary" means the beneficiary of a future interest and includes a class member if the future interest is in the form of a class gift.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   "Class member" includes, but is not limited to, an individual who failed to survive the distribution date but who would have taken under a future interest in the form of a class gift had he or she survived the distribution date.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   "Distribution date" means, with respect to a future interest, the time when the future interest takes effect in possession or enjoyment. The distribution date does not need to occur at the beginning or end of a calendar day, but can occur at a time during the course of a day.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   "Future interest under the terms of a trust" means a future interest that is created by a transfer creating a trust or to an existing trust or by an exercise of a power of appointment to an existing trust, directing the continuance of an existing trust, designating a beneficiary of an existing trust, or creating a trust.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2714.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Subject to subsection (2), a future interest under the terms of a trust is contingent on the beneficiary surviving the distribution date. If a beneficiary of a future interest under the terms of a trust fails to survive the distribution date, the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Except as provided in subdivision (d), if the future interest is not in the form of a class gift and the deceased beneficiary leaves surviving descendants, a substitute gift is created in the beneficiary's surviving descendants. The surviving descendants take by representation the property to which the beneficiary would have been entitled had the beneficiary survived the distribution date.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Except as provided in subdivision (d), if the future interest is in the form of a class gift, other than a future interest to "issue", "descendants", "heirs of the body", "heirs", "next of kin", "relatives", or "family" or a class described by language of similar import, a substitute gift is created in the surviving descendants of a deceased beneficiary. The property to which the beneficiaries would have been entitled had all of them survived the distribution date passes to the surviving beneficiaries and the surviving descendants of the deceased beneficiaries. Each surviving beneficiary takes the share to which he or she would have been entitled had the deceased beneficiaries survived the distribution date. Each deceased beneficiary's surviving descendants who are substituted for the deceased beneficiary take by representation the share to which the deceased beneficiary would have been entitled had the deceased beneficiary survived the distribution date. As used in this subdivision, "deceased beneficiary" means a class member who fails to survive the distribution date and leaves 1 or more surviving descendants.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   For the purposes of section 2701, words of survivorship attached to a future interest are not, in the absence of additional evidence, a sufficient indication of an intent contrary to the application of this section. Words of survivorship include words of survivorship that relate to the distribution date or to an earlier or an unspecified time, whether those words of survivorship are expressed in condition-precedent, condition-subsequent, or another form.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   If a governing instrument creates an alternative future interest with respect to a future interest for which a substitute gift is created by subdivision (a) or (b), the substitute gift is superseded by the alternative future interest only if an expressly designated beneficiary of the alternative future interest is entitled to take in possession or enjoyment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Subsection (1) does not apply to a future interest if the beneficiary of the interest died or irrevocably transferred the interest before April 1, 2000.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Except as provided in subdivision (b), the property passes under the primary substitute gift.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the trust is created in a nonresiduary devise in the transferor's will or in a codicil to the transferor's will, the property passes under the residuary clause in the transferor's will.

</P>
<P>Sec. 2718.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If an applicable statute or a governing instrument calls for the property to be distributed "by representation" or "per capita at each generation", the property is divided into as many equal shares as there are surviving descendants in the generation nearest to the designated ancestor that contains 1 or more surviving descendants and deceased descendants in the same generation who left surviving descendants, if any. Each surviving descendant in the nearest generation is allocated 1 share. The remaining shares, if any, are combined and then divided in the same manner among the surviving descendants of the deceased descendants as if the surviving descendants who were allocated a share and their surviving descendants had predeceased the distribution date. This rule of construction applies to documents originally created on and after April 1, 2000, and to all instruments amended on and after April 1, 2000, that use the phrase "by representation" or "per capita at each generation". If an amendment uses either phrase, the rule of this section applies to the entire instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a governing instrument calls for property to be distributed "per stirpes", the property is divided into as many equal shares as there are surviving children of the designated ancestor and deceased children who left surviving descendants. Each surviving child, if any, is allocated 1 share. The share of each deceased child with surviving descendants is divided in the same manner, with subdivision repeating at each succeeding generation until the property is fully allocated among surviving descendants.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), a deceased individual who left no surviving descendant is disregarded, and an individual who leaves a surviving ancestor who is a descendant of the designated ancestor is not entitled to a share.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   As used in this section:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Deceased child" or "deceased descendant" means a child or descendant who either predeceases the distribution date or is considered to predecease the distribution date under section 2702.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Distribution date" means, with respect to an interest, the time when the interest is to take effect in possession or enjoyment. The distribution date does not need to occur at the beginning or end of a calendar day, but can occur at a time during the course of a day.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   "Surviving ancestor", "surviving child", or "surviving descendant" means an ancestor, a child, or a descendant who does not predecease the distribution date and is not considered to have predeceased the distribution date under section 2702.</DIV>

Language in a governing instrument describing the beneficiaries of a disposition as the transferor's "heirs", "heirs at law", "next of kin", "distributees", "relatives", or "family", or language of similar import, does not create or presumptively create a reversionary interest in the transferor.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in subsection (3), for purposes of interpreting a will, trust, or beneficiary designation of or by a decedent who dies after December 31, 2009 and before January 1, 2011, a will, trust, or beneficiary designation is presumed to refer to the federal estate tax and federal generation-skipping transfer tax laws as they apply to estates of decedents who die on January 1, 2010, in accordance with section 302(c) of the 2010 federal tax relief act without regard to the election permitted by section 301(c) of that act, if either of the following applies to the will, trust, or beneficiary designation:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The will, trust, or beneficiary designation contains a formula referring to the unified credit, estate tax exemption, applicable exemption amount, applicable credit amount, applicable exclusion amount, taxable estate, gross estate, estate tax value, generation-skipping transfer tax exemption, GST exemption, marital deduction, maximum marital deduction, unlimited marital deduction, inclusion ratio, applicable fraction, or any section of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 1 to 9834, relating to the federal estate tax or generation-skipping transfer tax.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The will, trust, or beneficiary designation measures a share of an estate, trust, or contractual benefit subject to a beneficiary designation based on the amount that can pass free of federal estate tax or the amount that can pass free of federal generation-skipping transfer tax or based on a similar provision of federal estate tax or federal generation-skipping transfer tax law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A presumption that arises under subsection (1) is a rebuttable presumption that the decedent intended that the formula be construed as provided in subsection (1). A fiduciary of an estate, trust, or contractual benefit subject to a beneficiary designation under which the presumption is applicable shall give notice to each beneficiary whose interest is affected by the presumption. A presumption that arises under subsection (1) does not preclude a fiduciary from making any available election, including an election under section 301(c) of the 2010 federal tax relief act. A fiduciary who has made an election under section 301(c) of the 2010 federal tax relief act may commence a proceeding to determine whether the decedent would not have intended the formula to be construed as provided in subsection (1). All interested persons affected by a presumption that arises under subsection (1) may enter into a nonjudicial settlement under section 7111 that the decedent intended the formula to be construed in a different manner from the presumption under subsection (1). A beneficiary whose interest is affected by the presumption or a fiduciary of the will, trust, or contractual benefit subject to a beneficiary designation may commence a proceeding to determine whether the decedent intended that the formula be construed as provided under subsection (1). Solely for the purpose of determining the intent of the decedent regarding the formula under this section, the court may consider the surrounding circumstances and the rules of construction. A person who commences a proceeding under this section has the burdens of proof and persuasion in establishing the decedent's intent that the formula should not be construed as provided in subsection (1). A proceeding under this subsection shall be commenced or a nonjudicial settlement under this subsection shall be executed within whichever of the following is earlier:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Two years after the decedent's death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Six months after the fiduciary sent the beneficiary a notice of the presumption under this subsection or the due date for filing the federal estate tax return of the decedent, if later.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A presumption under subsection (1) does not apply with respect to a will, trust, or beneficiary designation that is executed or amended after December 31, 2010, or that manifests an intent that a contrary rule shall apply if the decedent dies on a date when no federal estate or generation-skipping transfer tax would apply.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) This section is a remedial response to changes in the federal estate tax and generation-skipping transfer tax and takes effect retroactively on January 1, 2010.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) As used in this section, "2010 federal tax relief act" means the tax relief, unemployment insurance reauthorization, and job creation act of 2010, Public Law 111-312.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An individual who feloniously and intentionally kills or who is convicted of committing abuse, neglect, or exploitation with respect to the decedent forfeits all benefits under this article with respect to the decedent's estate, including an intestate share, an elective share, an omitted spouse's or child's share, a homestead allowance, a family allowance, and exempt property. If the decedent died intestate, the decedent's intestate estate passes as if the killer or felon disclaimed his or her intestate share.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The felonious and intentional killing or the conviction of the felon for the abuse, neglect, or exploitation of the decedent does all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Revokes all of the following that are revocable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Disposition or appointment of property made by the decedent to the killer or felon in a governing instrument.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Provision in a governing instrument conferring a general or nongeneral power of appointment on the killer or felon.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Nomination of the killer or felon in a governing instrument, nominating or appointing the killer or felon to serve in a fiduciary or representative capacity, including a personal representative, executor, funeral representative, trustee, or agent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Severs the interests of the decedent and killer or felon in property held by them at the time of the killing, abuse, neglect, or exploitation as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, transforming the interests of the decedent and killer or felon into tenancies in common.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Bars the killer or felon from exercising a power under section 3206(1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A severance under subsection (2)(b) does not affect a third party interest in property acquired for value and in good faith reliance on an apparent title by survivorship in the killer or felon unless a writing declaring the severance has been noted, registered, filed, or recorded in records appropriate to the kind and location of the property that are relied on, in the ordinary course of transactions involving that type of property, as evidence of ownership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A provision of a governing instrument is given effect as if the killer or felon disclaimed all provisions revoked by this section or, for a revoked nomination in a fiduciary or representative capacity, as if the killer or felon predeceased the decedent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A killer's or felon's wrongful acquisition of property or interest not covered by this section must be treated in accordance with the principle that a killer or felon cannot profit from his or her wrong.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) After all right to appeal has been exhausted, a judgment of conviction establishing criminal accountability for the felonious and intentional killing or the abuse, neglect, or exploitation of the decedent conclusively establishes the convicted individual as the decedent's killer or as a felon, as applicable, for purposes of this section. With respect to a claim of felonious and intentional killing, in the absence of a conviction, the court, on the petition of an interested person, shall determine whether, under the preponderance of evidence standard, the individual would be found criminally accountable for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent. If the court determines that, under that standard, the individual would be found criminally accountable for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent, the determination conclusively establishes the individual as the decedent's killer for purposes of this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) This section does not apply if the forfeiture, revocation, or severance would occur because of abuse, neglect, or exploitation and the decedent executed a governing instrument after the date of the conviction expressing a specific intent to allow the felon to inherit or otherwise receive the estate or property of the decedent.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a payor or other third party is not liable for having made a payment or transferred an item of property or another benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument affected by an intentional and felonious killing or by abuse, neglect, or exploitation, or for having taken another action in reliance on the validity of the governing instrument, upon request and satisfactory proof of the decedent's death. A payor or other third party is liable for a payment made or other action taken 10 or more business days after the payor or other third party actually receives written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under section 2803. A payor or other third party is not obligated to determine whether the decedent was the victim of felonious killing or abuse, neglect, or exploitation or to seek evidence relating to such a killing or abuse, neglect, or exploitation even if the circumstances of the decedent's death are suspicious as to the beneficiary's participation in such a killing or if there is evidence that would raise suspicions that the decedent was the victim of abuse, neglect, or exploitation by the beneficiary. A recipient who incorrectly receives a payment, transfer of property, or other benefit is liable for the payment or transfer received, whether or not written notice of the claim is given.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under subsection (1) must be mailed to the payor's or other third party's main office or home by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or served upon the payor or other third party in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. Notice to a sales representative of a payor or other third party does not constitute notice to the payor or other third party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The written notice under subsection (1) must include all of the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The decedent's name, age, and date of birth, and 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The last 4 digits of the decedent's social security number.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The name of the person asserting an interest. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The nature of the payment, item of property, or other benefit. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A statement that a claim of forfeiture or revocation is being made under section 2803.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the claim is based on a conviction for abuse, neglect, or exploitation, a copy of the judgment of conviction. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Notice in a form or service in a manner other than that described in this section does not impose liability on a payor or other third party for an action taken in accordance with a governing instrument.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Upon receipt of written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under this section, a payor or other third party may pay an amount owed to the county treasurer of the county of the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estate or, if no proceedings have been commenced, to the county treasurer of the county of the decedent's residence. With a payment under this section, the payor or other third party shall file a copy of the written notice received by the payor or other third party. A payment made to the county treasurer discharges the payor or other third party from a claim for the value of an amount paid to the county treasurer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The county treasurer shall not charge a filing fee for a payment to the county treasurer under this section. The county treasurer shall hold the money in accordance with section 3917 and, upon the court's determination under section 2803, shall disburse the money in accordance with the determination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The provision for payment to the county treasurer under this section does not preclude a payor or other third party from taking another action authorized by law or the governing instrument.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Disclaimable interest" includes, but is not limited to, property, the right to receive or control property, and a power of appointment. Disclaimable interest does not include an interest retained by or conferred upon the disclaimant by the disclaimant at the creation of the interest. For purposes of this definition, the survivorship interest in joint property is not considered to be an interest retained or conferred upon the disclaimant even if the disclaimant created the joint property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Effective date of a governing instrument other than a will or trust created by will" means the date on which a property right vests or a contract right arises, even though either right is subject to divestment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Fiduciary" includes, but is not limited to, an agent, a conservator, a guardian if no conservator has been appointed, a guardian ad litem, a personal representative, a trustee, a probate court acting through a protective order under this act, and a temporary, successor, or foreign fiduciary.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) "Governing instrument" means a deed, assignment, bill of sale, will, trust, beneficiary designation, contract, instrument creating or exercising a power of appointment or a power of attorney, or another instrument under which property devolves, a property right is created, or a contract right is created. Governing instrument includes the provable terms of an oral contract or arrangement under which property devolves or a property right is created.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) "Joint property" means property that is owned by 2 or more persons with rights of survivorship, and includes a tenancy by the entireties in real property, a tenancy in personal property as provided in section 1 of 1927 PA 212, MCL 557.151, a joint tenancy, a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, and a joint life estate with contingent remainder in fee. For purposes of this part, joint property is considered to consist of a present interest and a future interest. The future interest is the right of survivorship.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) "Person" includes an entity and an individual, but does not include a fiduciary, an estate, or a trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) "Property" means anything that may be the subject of ownership. Property includes both real and personal property and an interest in property, including a present interest; a future interest; a legal interest; an equitable interest; an interest acquired by testate succession, by intestate or other statutory succession, by succession to a disclaimed interest, or by lapse or release of a power of appointment; or an interest that may be otherwise acquired under a governing instrument.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) "Trust" means a fiduciary relationship with respect to property that subjects the person who holds title to the property to equitable duties to deal with the property for the benefit of another person, which fiduciary relationship arises as a result of a manifestation of an intention to create it. Trust includes an express trust, private or charitable, with additions to the trust, whether created by will or other than by will, and includes a trust created by statute, judgment, or decree under which the trust is to be administered in the manner of an express trust. Trust does not include a constructive trust or a resulting trust.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A spendthrift provision or similar restriction that limits the interest of the disclaimant.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A restriction or limitation on the right to disclaim contained in the governing instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A fiduciary may disclaim a fiduciary power. The right to disclaim a fiduciary power exists notwithstanding a restriction or limitation on the right to disclaim contained in the governing instrument.</DIV>

The barring of the right to disclaim a present interest under section 2910 does not bar the right to disclaim the future interest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A fiduciary power may be disclaimed at any time, before or after exercise of the power. The disclaimer must be delivered to the person who established the instrument that gave rise to the power or to 1 of the following:</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a disclaimed interest arises out of joint property created by a governing instrument, testamentary or nontestamentary, the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the disclaimant is the only living owner, the disclaimed interest devolves to the estate of the last to die of the other joint owners.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the disclaimant is not the only living owner, the disclaimed interest devolves to the other living joint owners equally or, if there is only 1 living owner, all to the other living owner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the donee of a power of appointment or other power not held in a fiduciary capacity disclaims the power, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the donee has not exercised the power, the disclaimer takes effect as of the time the instrument creating the power becomes effective.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the donee has exercised the power, the disclaimer takes effect immediately after the last exercise of the power.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The instrument creating the power is construed as if the power expired when the disclaimer became effective.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If all incumbent trustees disclaim a disclaimable interest, and the governing instrument does not provide for another disposition of the disclaimed interest if it is disclaimed or for another disposition of disclaimed or failed interests in general, then the disclaimed interest devolves as if the trust with respect to which the disclaimer was made never existed. If less than all incumbent trustees disclaim a disclaimable interest and the governing instrument does not provide for another disposition of the disclaimed interest under those circumstances, then the trustee who disclaims is treated as never having had any interest in or power over the disclaimed interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a fiduciary disclaims a fiduciary power, the fiduciary power ceases to exist as of the effective date of the disclaimer. A disclaimer of a fiduciary power by 1 of multiple incumbent fiduciaries is binding only on the fiduciary who disclaims and is not binding on the other incumbent fiduciaries or on successor fiduciaries. A disclaimer of a fiduciary power by all incumbent fiduciaries is binding on all successor fiduciaries, unless the disclaimer states otherwise.</div>

<P>Sec. 2910.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The right to disclaim property is barred by any of the following events that occur after the event giving rise to the right to disclaim and before the disclaimer is perfected:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   An assignment, conveyance, encumbrance, pledge, or transfer of the property, or a contract for such a transaction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A written waiver of the right to disclaim.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The expiration of the permitted applicable perpetuities period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The right to disclaim is barred to the extent provided by other applicable law. A partial bar does not preclude the disclaimant from disclaiming all or any part of the balance of the property if the disclaimant has received a portion of the property and there still remains an interest that the disclaimant is yet to receive.

In addition, each sheet should be consecutively numbered.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The will's date is the date of its signature by the authorized individual. The authorized individual should note that date at the end of the will.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The authorized individual should ask the testator whether he or she wishes to make a declaration concerning the will's safekeeping.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) For either formal or informal proceedings, subject to subsection (2), persons who are not disqualified have priority for appointment as a general personal representative in the following order:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The person with priority as determined by a probated will including a person nominated by a power conferred in a will.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Other heirs of the decedent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) After 42 days after the decedent's death, the nominee of a creditor if the court finds the nominee suitable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) After 63 days after the decedent's death, or if the court determines exigent circumstances exist, the state or county public administrator if any of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) No interested person applied or petitioned for appointment of a personal representative within 63 days or the number of days determined by the court under this subdivision after the decedent's death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The decedent died apparently leaving no known heirs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) There is no spouse, heir, or beneficiary under a will who is a United States resident and is entitled to a distributive share in the decedent's estate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An objection to the appointment of a personal representative may be made only in a formal proceeding. If an objection is made, the priorities prescribed by subsection (1) apply except in either of the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the estate appears to be more than adequate to meet exemptions and costs of administration but inadequate to discharge anticipated unsecured claims, on petition of creditors, the court may appoint any qualified person.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If a devisee or heir who appears to have a substantial interest in the estate objects to the appointment of a person whose priority is not determined by will, the court may appoint a person who is acceptable to the devisees and heirs whose interests in the estate appear to be worth in total more than 1/2 of the probable distributable value or, if no person is acceptable to these devisees and heirs, any suitable person.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A person entitled to letters under subsection (1)(b) to (e) may nominate a qualified person to act as personal representative. A person may renounce his or her right to nominate or to an appointment by filing an appropriate writing with the court. If 2 or more persons share a priority, those of them who do not renounce shall concur in nominating another to act for them or in applying for appointment.</div>

The state or county public administrator must be appointed only in a formal proceeding. Before appointing the state or county public administrator or any other person without priority, the court shall determine that persons having priority have been notified of the proceedings and have failed to request appointment or to nominate another person for appointment, and that administration is necessary.</div>

For purposes of this subsection only, "exercise their rights or powers under subsection (1)" means providing the person that holds a license under article 18 of the occupational code, 1980 PA 299, MCL 339.1801 to 339.1812, in possession of the decedent's body with authorization to bury or cremate the decedent's body.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If 2 or more individuals share the rights and powers described in subsection (1) as determined under subsection (3) or (4), the rights and powers must be exercised as decided by a majority of the individuals who can be located after reasonable efforts. If a majority cannot agree, any of the individuals may file a petition under section 3207.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Venue for a petition filed under subsection (1) is in the county in which the decedent was domiciled at the time of death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) On receipt of a petition under this section, the court shall set a date for a hearing on the petition. The hearing date must be as soon as possible, but not later than 7 business days after the date the petition is filed. Notice of the petition and the hearing must be served not less than 2 days before the date of the hearing on every individual who has highest priority as determined under section 3206(3) and (4), unless the court orders that service on every such individual is not required. Unless an individual cannot be located after a reasonable good-faith effort has been made to contact the individual, service must be made on the individual personally or in a manner reasonably designed to give the individual notice. Notice of the hearing must include notice of the individual's right to appear at the hearing. An individual served with notice of the hearing may waive his or her rights. If written waivers from all persons entitled to notice are filed, the court may immediately hear the petition.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The nature of the personal relationship to the deceased of the person bringing the action compared to other individuals with the rights and powers under section 3206(1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Whether the person bringing the action is ready, willing, and able to pay the costs of the funeral arrangements or the handling or disposition of the body.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Whether the decedent executed a funeral representative designation under section 3206(2) or a designation described in section 3206(3)(a). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the decedent was married at the time of his or her death, whether the decedent's spouse was physically and emotionally separated from the decedent at the time of his or her death and had been separated for a period of time that clearly demonstrates an absence of due affection, trust, and regard between the spouse and the decedent.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A funeral establishment is not required to file a petition under section 3207 and is not civilly liable for not filing a petition under section 3207. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A funeral establishment, cemetery, or crematory may rely on the designation of a funeral representative under section 3206(2), the designation of a person as described in section 3206(3)(a), the order of priority determined under section 3206(3) and (4), or a court order under section 3207 that determines who may exercise the rights and powers under section 3206(1). A funeral establishment, cemetery, or crematory is not a guarantor that a person exercising the rights and powers under section 3206(1) has the legal authority to exercise those rights and powers. A cemetery or crematory may rely on a funeral establishment's representation as to who may exercise the rights and powers under section 3206(1). A funeral establishment, cemetery, or crematory does not have the responsibility to contact or independently investigate the existence of relatives of the deceased, but may rely on information provided by family members of the deceased or by a person other than a family member that the funeral establishment, cemetery, or crematory reasonably believes knows the existence or location of the relatives of the deceased or the funeral representative. As used in this subsection, "information" includes, but is not limited to, an affirmation that reasonable efforts to contact the individual or individuals with the rights and powers under section 3601(1) and to inform the individual or individuals of the death have been made without success.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A funeral establishment, holder of a license to practice mortuary science issued by this state, cemetery, or crematory, or an officer or employee of a funeral establishment, holder of a license to practice mortuary science issued by this state, cemetery, or crematory may rely on sections 3206 and 3207 and this section and the instructions of a person described in section 3206(2) to (9) or a person that the court determines under section 3207 has rights and powers under section 3206(1) regarding funeral arrangements and the handling, disposition, or disinterment of a body and is not civilly liable to any person for the reliance if the reliance was in good faith.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upon receipt of an application requesting informal probate of a will and after making the findings required by section 3303, the register shall issue a written statement of informal probate. Informal probate is conclusive as to all persons until superseded by an order in a formal testacy proceeding.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   An original, properly executed, and apparently unrevoked will is in the register's possession.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   That the application is not within section 3304.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The register shall deny the application if the application indicates that a personal representative has been appointed in another county of this state or, except as provided in subsection (4), if it appears that this or another will of the decedent has been the subject of a previous probate order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A will that appears to have the required signatures and that contains an attestation clause showing that requirements of execution under section 2502 or 2506 have been met shall be probated without further proof. In other cases, the register may assume execution if the will appears to have been properly executed, or the register may accept a sworn statement of a person having knowledge of the circumstances of execution, whether or not the person was a witness to the will.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Informal probate of a will that was previously probated elsewhere may be granted at any time upon written application by an interested person, together with deposit of an authenticated copy of the will and of the statement probating it from the office or court where the will was first probated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A will from a place that does not provide for probate of a will after death and that is not eligible for probate under subsection (1) may be probated in this state upon receipt by the register of a properly authenticated copy of the will and a properly authenticated certificate of its legal custodian that the copy filed is a true copy and that the will has become operative under the law of the other place.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Within 28 days after an informal probate is granted, the applicant shall give written information of the probate to the heirs, devisees, a person who demands it under section 3205, and other interested persons. The applicant also shall give information of the probate to the attorney general, public administration division, if the devisees under the will would not be entitled to share in the estate but for the terms of the will and the decedent died without leaving any known heirs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The information required by subsection (1) must include the applicant's name and address, the name and location of the court granting the informal probate, and the date of the probate. The information must be delivered or sent by ordinary mail to each person entitled to notice whose address is reasonably available to the applicant. There is no duty to give information as required by this section if a personal representative is appointed who is required to give the written information required by section 3705. An applicant's failure to give information as required by this section is a breach of the applicant's duty to a person entitled to notice, but does not affect the validity of the probate.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3401.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A formal testacy proceeding is litigation to determine whether a decedent left a valid will. An interested person or a person that has a right or cause of action that cannot be enforced without administration may commence a formal testacy proceeding by filing 1 of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A petition described in section 3402(1) in which the petitioner requests that after notice and hearing, the court enter an order probating a will.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A petition to set aside a will's informal probate or to prevent a will's informal probate that is the subject of a pending application.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A petition in accordance with section 3402(2) for an order that the decedent died intestate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A petitioner may seek formal probate of a will without regard to whether the same or a conflicting will has been informally probated. A formal testacy proceeding may, but need not, involve a request for appointment of a personal representative.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   During the pendency of a formal testacy proceeding, the register shall not act upon an application for informal probate of a will of the decedent or an application for informal appointment of a personal representative of the decedent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Unless a petition in a formal testacy proceeding also requests confirmation of the previous informal appointment, after receipt of notice of the commencement of a formal probate proceeding, a previously appointed personal representative shall refrain from exercising the power to make any further distribution of the estate during the pendency of the formal proceeding. A petitioner who seeks the appointment of a different personal representative in a formal proceeding may also request an order restraining the acting personal representative from exercising that office's powers and may request the appointment of a special personal representative. In the absence of a request under this subsection or if the request is denied, the commencement of a formal proceeding has no effect on the powers and duties of a previously appointed personal representative other than those relating to distribution.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 3402.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A petition for formal probate of a will or for adjudication of intestacy with or without request for appointment of a personal representative must be directed to the court, must request a judicial order after notice and hearing, and must contain the statements required by this section. A petition for formal probate of a will must include all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A request for an order as to the testacy of the decedent in relation to a particular instrument that may or may not have been informally probated and a request for an order determining the decedent's heirs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The statements required for an informal application prescribed by section 3301(1)(a) and (b)(ii) and (iii).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A statement as to whether the original of the decedent's last will is in the court's possession or accompanies the petition. If the original will is not in the court's possession or neither the original will nor an authenticated copy of a will probated in another jurisdiction accompanies the petition, the petition must also state the will's contents and shall indicate that the will is lost, destroyed, or otherwise unavailable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A petition for adjudication of intestacy and appointment of a personal representative in intestacy must include all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A request for a judicial finding and order that the decedent left no will and determining the heirs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The statements required by section 3301(1)(a) and (d).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A statement indicating whether supervised administration is sought. A petition under this subsection may request an order determining intestacy and heirs without requesting the appointment of a personal representative, in which case, the statements required by section 3301(1)(d)(ii) may be omitted.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 3405.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a petition in a testacy proceeding is unopposed, the court may either order probate or intestacy on the strength of the pleadings if satisfied that the conditions of section 3409 have been met or conduct a hearing in open court and require proof of the matters necessary to support the order sought.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If evidence concerning execution of the will is necessary, the sworn statement or testimony of 1 of the attesting witnesses to the instrument is sufficient. If the sworn statement or testimony of an attesting witness is not available, execution of the will may be proved by other evidence or sworn statement. If, after diligent search and effort and after the signature of the testator is identified, it appears that the whereabouts of the witnesses to a will cannot be ascertained and it appears on the face of the will that the requirements in this section for a valid will have been met, a presumption arises that the will was executed in all particulars as required by law.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If evidence concerning execution of an attested will that is not self-proved is necessary in a contested case, the testimony of at least 1 of the attesting witnesses, if within the state and if competent and able to testify, is required. Due execution of an attested or unattested will may be proved by other evidence.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a will is self-proved, compliance with signature requirements for execution is conclusively presumed and other requirements of execution are presumed subject to rebuttal without the testimony of any witness upon filing the will and the acknowledgment and sworn statements annexed or attached to the will, unless there is proof of fraud or forgery affecting the acknowledgment or a sworn statement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a witness is competent at the time he or she signs the will, the witness's subsequent incompetency from whatever cause does not prevent admission of the will to probate, if it is otherwise satisfactorily proved.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   All of the following apply in a contested case:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A petitioner who seeks to establish intestacy has the burden of establishing prima facie proof of death, venue, and heirship.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A proponent of a will has the burden of establishing prima facie proof of due execution in all cases and, if the proponent is also a petitioner, prima facie proof of death and venue.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A contestant of a will has the burden of establishing lack of testamentary intent or capacity, undue influence, fraud, duress, mistake, or revocation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A party has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to a matter with respect to which the party has the initial burden of proof.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The court shall entertain a petition for modification or vacation of its order and probate of another will of the decedent if it is shown that the proponents of the later-offered will were unaware of that will's existence at the time of the earlier proceeding, or were unaware of the earlier proceeding and were given no notice of it, except by publication.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If intestacy of all or part of the estate has been ordered, the determination of the decedent's heirs may be reconsidered if it is shown that an individual was omitted from the determination and that the omitted individual was unaware of his or her relationship to the decedent, was unaware of the decedent's death, or was not given notice of any proceeding concerning the decedent's estate, except by publication.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A petition for vacation filed under subsection (1) shall be filed before the earlier of the following time limits:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If a personal representative is appointed for the estate, the time of entry of an order approving final distribution of the estate or, if the estate is closed by statement, 6 months after the filing of the closing statement.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The order originally rendered in the testacy proceeding may be modified or vacated, if appropriate under the circumstances, by the order of probate of the later-offered will or the order redetermining heirs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The finding of the fact of death is conclusive as to the alleged decedent only if notice of the hearing on the petition in the formal testacy proceeding was sent by registered or certified mail addressed to the alleged decedent at his or her last known address and the court finds that a search was made as required by section 3403.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the alleged decedent is not dead, even if notice was sent and the search was made, the alleged decedent may recover estate assets in the hands of the personal representative. In addition to any remedies available to the alleged decedent by reason of any fraud or intentional wrongdoing, the alleged decedent may recover any estate or its proceeds from distributees that is in their hands, or the value of distributions received by them, to the extent that any recovery from distributees is equitable in view of all of the circumstances.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In filing the statement of acceptance, the personal representative may exclude from the scope of the personal representative's responsibility, for a period not to exceed 91 days, real estate or an ownership interest in a business entity if the personal representative reasonably believes the real estate or other property owned by the business entity is or may be contaminated by a hazardous substance, or is or has been used for any activity directly or indirectly involving a hazardous substance, that could result in liability to the estate or otherwise impair the value of property held in the estate. The personal representative must identify the real estate or ownership interest being excluded and shall specify the time period of exclusion.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the personal representative identifies excluded property under subsection (2), the personal representative's responsibilities extend to the excluded property at the end of the exclusion period or upon the personal representative's notice to the court of acceptance of that property, unless, before the end of the exclusion period, the personal representative requests the court to appoint a special personal representative with respect to the excluded property or to exercise administrative authority over the excluded property by direct judicial order.</DIV>

The register shall determine that the bond is duly executed by a corporate surety, or 1 or more individual sureties whose performance is secured by pledge of personal property, mortgage on real property, or other adequate security. The register may permit the amount of the bond to be reduced by the value of estate property deposited in this state with a financial institution in a manner that prevents the property's unauthorized disposition.

<P>Sec. 3606.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The following requirements and provisions apply to a bond required by this part:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A bond shall name the state of Michigan as obligee for the benefit of the persons interested in the estate and shall be conditioned upon the faithful discharge by the fiduciary of all duties according to law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Unless otherwise provided by the terms of the approved bond, sureties are jointly and severally liable with the personal representative and with each other. The address of sureties shall be stated in the bond.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   By executing an approved bond of a personal representative, the surety consents to the jurisdiction of the court that issues letters to the primary obligor in a proceeding pertaining to the personal representative's fiduciary duties and naming the surety as a party. The petitioner shall notify a surety of a proceeding by personal service or by registered or certified mail to the surety's address as listed with the court where the bond is filed and to the surety's address as then known to the petitioner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   On petition of a successor personal representative, another personal representative of the same decedent, or an interested person, a proceeding in the court may be initiated against a surety for breach of the obligation of the personal representative's bond. If a fiduciary fails to perform a duty or perform a duty properly, the court may order a surety to perform an act the fiduciary should have performed or to correct an act the fiduciary performed improperly.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The personal representative's bond is not void after the first recovery but may be proceeded against from time to time until the whole penalty is exhausted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   An action or proceeding shall not be commenced against the surety on a matter as to which an action or proceeding against the primary obligor is barred by adjudication or limitation.</DIV>

A person with whom the personal representative may transact business may be made a party.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Termination of appointment of a personal representative occurs as provided in sections 3609 to 3612. Termination ends the right and power pertaining to the office of personal representative as conferred by this act or a will, except that a personal representative, at any time before distribution or until restrained or enjoined by court order, may perform an act necessary to protect the estate and may deliver property to a successor personal representative. Termination does not discharge a personal representative from liability for a transaction or omission occurring before termination, or relieve the personal representative of the duty to preserve property subject to the personal representative's control, and to account for and deliver that property. Termination does not affect the court's jurisdiction over the personal representative, but does terminate the personal representative's authority to represent the estate in a pending or future proceeding.</DIV>

Except as otherwise ordered under section 3607, after receipt of notice of removal proceedings, the personal representative shall not act except to account, to correct maladministration, or preserve the estate.

A personal representative's powers relate back in time to give acts by the person appointed that are beneficial to the estate occurring before appointment the same effect as those occurring after appointment. Subject to sections 3206 to 3207, before or after appointment, a person named as personal representative in a will may carry out the decedent's written instructions relating to the decedent's body, funeral, and burial arrangements. A personal representative may ratify and accept an act on behalf of the estate done by another if the act would have been proper for a personal representative.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A person to whom general letters are issued first has exclusive authority under the letters until the appointment is terminated or modified.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A personal representative is a fiduciary who shall observe the standard of care applicable to a trustee as described by section 7803. A personal representative is under a duty to settle and distribute the decedent's estate in accordance with the terms of a probated and effective will and this act, and as expeditiously and efficiently as is consistent with the best interests of the estate. The personal representative shall use the authority conferred by this act, the terms of the will, if any, and an order in a proceeding to which the personal representative is party for the best interests of claimants whose claims have been allowed and of successors to the estate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A personal representative shall not be surcharged for acts of administration or distribution if the conduct in question was authorized at the time. Subject to other obligations of administration, an informally probated will is authority to administer and distribute the estate according to the will's terms. Whether issued in an informal or formal proceeding, an order of appointment of a personal representative is authority to distribute apparently intestate property to the decedent's heirs if, at the time of distribution, the personal representative is not aware of a pending testacy proceeding, a proceeding to vacate an order entered in an earlier testacy proceeding, a formal proceeding questioning the personal representative's appointment or fitness to continue, or a supervised administration proceeding. Nothing in this section affects the personal representative's duty to administer and distribute the estate in accordance with the rights of a claimant whose claim has been allowed, the surviving spouse, a minor or dependent child, or a pretermitted child of the decedent as described elsewhere in this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as to a proceeding that does not survive the decedent's death, a personal representative of a decedent domiciled in this state at death has the same standing to sue and be sued in the courts of this state and the courts of another jurisdiction as the decedent had immediately prior to death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The personal representative shall keep each presumptive distributee informed of the estate settlement. Until a beneficiary's share is fully distributed, the personal representative shall annually, and upon completion of the estate settlement, account to each beneficiary by supplying a statement of the activities of the estate and of the personal representative, specifying all receipts and disbursements and identifying property belonging to the estate.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A personal representative shall proceed expeditiously with the settlement and distribution of a decedent's estate and, except as otherwise specified or ordered in regard to a supervised personal representative, do so without adjudication, order, or direction of the court.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Not later than 28 days after a personal representative's appointment or other time specified by court rule, the personal representative, except a special personal representative, shall give notice of the appointment to the decedent's heirs and devisees, except those who have executed a written waiver of notice, including, if there has been no formal testacy proceeding and if the personal representative is appointed on the assumption that the decedent died intestate, the devisees in a will mentioned in the application for appointment of a personal representative and to the trustee of a trust described in section 7605(1) as to which the decedent was settlor. The personal representative shall give the notice by personal service or by ordinary first-class mail to each person required to receive notice under this subsection whose address is reasonably available to the personal representative. However, the personal representative is not required to notify a person who was adjudicated in a prior formal testacy proceeding to have no interest in the estate. The notice required under this subsection must be in a form approved by the supreme court and must include all of the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That the court will not supervise the personal representative. This statement must not be included if the appointment is made in a supervised proceeding under part 5 of this article.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That, unless a person files a written objection to the appointment of the person named as personal representative in the notice or files a demand that bond or higher bond be posted, the person named in the notice is the personal representative without bond or with bond in the amount shown in the notice. This statement must not be included if the personal representative is appointed in a formal appointment proceeding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The name and address of the person appointed as the estate's personal representative.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) That, during the course of administering the estate, the personal representative must provide all interested persons with all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A copy of the petition for the personal representative's appointment and a copy of the will, if any, with the notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A copy of the inventory.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) A copy of the settlement petition or of the closing statement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Unless waived, a copy of the account, including, but not limited to, fiduciary fees and attorney fees charged to the estate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) If the personal representative is the state or county public administrator, a copy of any settlement statements from the sale of real property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) That an interested person may petition the court for a court hearing on any matter at any time during the estate's administration, including, but not limited to, distribution of assets and expenses of administration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) That federal and Michigan estate taxes, if any, must be paid within 9 months after the date of the decedent's death or another time period specified by law, to avoid penalties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) That, if the estate is not settled within 1 year after the personal representative's appointment, within 28 days after the anniversary of the appointment, the personal representative must file with the court and send to each interested person a notice that the estate remains under administration and must specify the reason for the continuation of settlement proceedings. If such a notice is not received, an interested person may petition the court for a hearing on the necessity for continued administration or for closure of the estate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The identity and location of the court where papers relating to the estate are on file.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The personal representative's failure to give the information required by subsection (1) is a breach of the personal representative's duty to the persons concerned, but does not affect the validity of the personal representative's appointment, powers, or other duties. A personal representative may inform other persons of the appointment by delivery or ordinary first-class mail.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A personal representative shall also give notice that includes the information described in subsection (1) to the attorney general, public administration division, under any of the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) It appears from the petition that the decedent died intestate without leaving a known heir.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) In the administration of an intestate estate, it appears that the decedent did not leave a known heir.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) In the administration of a testate estate, it appears that devisees of the purported will would not be entitled to share in the estate but for the terms of the will and that the decedent died without leaving a known heir.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If notice is required to be given to the attorney general under subsection (3), the attorney general, representing this state, has all the rights of an heir to be heard and to contest the validity of a claim, the appointment of a personal representative, an action of the personal representative, an order, an appointment, or an instrument purporting to be a decedent's contract or will, and has all the rights granted or accruing to an heir, representative, or creditor by a law relating to the settlement of a testate or intestate estate in court, or by way of rehearing or appeal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Within 28 days after the personal representative's appointment or another time specified by court rule, the personal representative, except a special personal representative, shall notify the decedent's surviving spouse, if any, of the spouse's right to election under part 2 of article II and of the time within which the election must be exercised.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, at the same time the notice required by subsection (1) is given, the personal representative shall give notice to the friend of the court for the county in which the estate is being administered, which notice identifies the decedent's surviving spouse and the individuals who are, for a testate estate, the devisees or, for an intestate estate, the heirs. The personal representative is not required to notify the friend of the court of a devise to a trustee of an existing trust or to a trustee under the will. A personal representative incurs no obligation or liability to the friend of the court or to another person for an error or omission made in good faith compliance with this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the personal representative is the state or county public administrator, and if the decedent's real property has delinquent property taxes, the personal representative shall also give written notice that includes the information described in subsection (1) to the treasurer of the county in which the real property subject to the tax foreclosure is located. The county treasurer may submit an affidavit to the court regarding the status of the real property for the court to consider in making its determination under section 3715(2)(a).</div>

A personal representative's request for delivery of property possessed by an heir or devisee is conclusive evidence, in an action against the heir or devisee for possession of that property, that the possession of the property by the personal representative is necessary for purposes of administration.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The transaction is approved by the court after notice to interested persons.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The transaction is otherwise permitted by statute.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A sale, encumbrance, or other transaction involving the investment or management of estate property is presumed to be affected by a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests if it is entered into by the personal representative with any of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A transaction not concerning estate property in which the personal representative engages in the personal representative's individual capacity involves a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests if the transaction concerns an opportunity properly belonging to the estate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An investment by a personal representative in securities of an investment company or investment trust to which the personal representative, or its affiliate, provides services in a capacity other than as personal representative is not presumed to be affected by a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests if the investment otherwise complies with the Michigan prudent investor rule. In addition to its compensation for acting as personal representative, the personal representative may be compensated by the investment company or investment trust for providing those services out of fees charged to the estate. If the personal representative receives compensation from the investment company or investment trust for providing investment advisory or investment management services, the personal representative shall at least annually notify the interested persons of the rate and method by which that compensation was determined.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) In voting shares of stock or in exercising powers of control over similar interests in other forms of enterprise, the personal representative shall act in the best interests of the beneficiaries.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A person who in good faith either assists a personal representative or deals with the personal representative for value is protected as if the personal representative properly exercised a power. The fact that a person knowingly deals with a personal representative does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The protection under this section extends to instances in which a procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurs in a proceeding leading to the issuance of letters, including a case in which the alleged decedent is found to be alive. The protection under this section does not substitute for the protection provided by a comparable provision of law relating to a commercial transaction or a law simplifying a transfer of securities by a fiduciary.

The warranties are binding on the estate as though the decedent made them but do not bind the personal representative except in a fiduciary capacity. In performing an enforceable contract by the decedent to convey or lease land, the personal representative, among other possible courses of action, may do any of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Acquire or dispose of property, including land in this or another state, for cash or on credit, at public or private sale; and manage, develop, improve, exchange, partition, change the character of, or abandon estate property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Make an ordinary or extraordinary repair or alteration in a building or other structure, demolish an improvement, or raze an existing or erect a new party wall or building.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Subdivide, develop, or dedicate land to public use, make or obtain the vacation of a plat or adjust a boundary, adjust a difference in valuation on exchange or partition by giving or receiving consideration, or dedicate an easement to public use without consideration.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Enter into a lease or arrangement for exploration and removal of minerals or another natural resource, or enter into a pooling or unitization agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) Abandon property when, in the opinion of the personal representative, it is valueless, or is so encumbered or in such a condition as to be of no benefit to the estate.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) Hold a security in the name of a nominee or in other form without disclosure of the estate's interest. However, the personal representative is liable for an act of the nominee in connection with the security so held.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(o) Insure the estate property against damage, loss, and liability and insure the personal representative against liability as to third persons.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(p) Borrow property with or without security to be repaid from the estate property or otherwise, and advance money for the estate's protection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(q) Effect a fair and reasonable compromise with a debtor or obligor, or extend, renew, or in any manner modify the terms of an obligation owing to the estate. If the personal representative holds a mortgage, pledge, or other lien upon another person's property, the personal representative may, in lieu of foreclosure, accept a conveyance or transfer of encumbered property from the property's owner in satisfaction of the indebtedness secured by lien.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(r) Pay a tax, an assessment, the personal representative's compensation, or another expense incident to the estate's administration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(s) Sell or exercise a stock subscription or conversion right.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A personal representative is entitled to reasonable compensation for services performed. A personal representative may pay the personal representative's own compensation periodically as earned without prior court approval.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If an attorney serves as personal representative, the attorney shall maintain time records that state the identity of the person performing personal representative services, the date the services are performed, the amount of time expended in performing the services, and a brief description of the services.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a will provides for the personal representative's compensation and there is no contract with the decedent regarding compensation, the personal representative may renounce the provision before qualifying and be entitled to reasonable compensation. A written contract between the decedent and the personal representative regarding compensation for estate settlement services is binding on the personal representative.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)    A personal representative also may renounce the right to all or a part of the compensation. A written renunciation of fee may be filed with the court and shall be served on all affected interested persons.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 3722.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In response to an environmental concern or hazard, a personal representative may do any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Inspect property or the operation of a business activity on property held by the personal representative, including property held in or operated by a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or limited liability company or any other type of entity, for the purpose of determining compliance with environmental law affecting the property and to respond to an actual or threatened violation of an environmental law affecting property held by the personal representative.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Take action necessary to prevent, abate, or otherwise remedy an actual or threatened violation of an environmental law affecting property held by the personal representative, either before or after a governmental body initiates an enforcement action.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Settle or compromise at any time a claim against the estate that a governmental body or private party may assert involving the alleged violation of an environmental law affecting property held in the trust or estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Disclaim a power granted by a document, statute, or rule of law that, in the sole discretion of the personal representative, may cause the personal representative to incur personal liability under an environmental law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Decline to serve or resign as a personal representative if the personal representative reasonably believes that there is or may be a conflict of interest between it in its fiduciary capacity and in its individual capacity because of a potential claim or liability that may be asserted against the personal representative on the estate's behalf because of the type or condition of property held in the estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Charge the cost of an inspection, review, abatement, response, cleanup, settlement of claim, or remedial action authorized by this section against the income or principal of the estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A personal representative is not personally liable to a beneficiary or other party for a decrease in value of estate property by reason of the personal representative's compliance with an environmental law, specifically including a reporting requirement under that law. The personal representative's acceptance of property or failure to inspect property or a business operation does not create an inference that there is or may be liability under an environmental law with respect to the property or business operation. The authority granted by this section is solely to facilitate the administration and protection of estate property and is not to impose greater responsibility or liability on the personal representative than imposed by law absent this section.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A claimant must present a claim against a decedent's estate in either of the following ways:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) By delivering or mailing a written statement to the personal representative indicating the claim's basis, the claimant's name and address, and the amount claimed, or by filing with the court a written statement of the claim in the form prescribed by supreme court rule and delivering or mailing a copy of the statement to the personal representative. The claim shall be considered presented on receipt of the claim statement by the personal representative or the filing of the claim statement with the court, whichever occurs first. If a claim is not yet due, the statement shall state the date when it will become due. If the claim is contingent or unliquidated, the statement shall state the nature of the uncertainty. If the claim is secured, the statement shall describe the security. Failure to describe correctly the security, the nature of any uncertainty, or the due date of a claim not yet due does not invalidate the claim's presentation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) By commencing a proceeding to obtain payment of a claim against the estate in a court in which the personal representative may be subjected to jurisdiction. The commencement of the proceeding shall occur within the time limit for presenting the claim. The presentation of a claim is not required in regard to a matter claimed in a proceeding against the decedent that is pending at the time of death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if a claim is presented under subsection (1)(a), a proceeding on the claim shall not be commenced more than 63 days after the personal representative delivers or mails a notice of disallowance to the claimant. For a claim that is not presently due or that is contingent or unliquidated, the personal representative may consent to an extension of the 63-day period or, to avoid injustice, the court, on petition, may order an extension of the 63-day period, but an extension shall not be consented to or ordered if the extension would run beyond the applicable statute of limitations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A claim by the personal representative against the estate shall be in the form prescribed by supreme court rule. The personal representative must give a copy of the claim to all interested persons not later than 7 days after the time for the claim's original presentation expires. The claim must contain a warning that the personal representative's claim will be allowed unless a notice of objection is delivered or mailed to the personal representative within 63 days after the time for the claim's original presentation expires. This subsection does not apply to a claim for compensation for services rendered or for reimbursement of expenses advanced by the personal representative.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The personal representative's failure to deliver or mail to a claimant notice of action on the claim within 63 days after the time for the claim's presentation expires or within 63 days after the personal representative's appointment, whichever is later, constitutes a notice of allowance. An interested person's failure to deliver or mail to the personal representative notice of an objection to a personal representative's claim within 63 days after the time the claim's original presentation expires constitutes a notice of allowance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   After allowing or disallowing a claim, the personal representative may change the allowance or disallowance as provided in this subsection. Before payment of a claim, the personal representative may change the allowance to a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after allowance by a court order or judgment or an order directing the claim's payment. The personal representative shall notify the claimant of the change to disallowance, and the disallowed claim is then subject to bar as provided in subsection (1). The personal representative may change a disallowance to an allowance, in whole or in part, until it is barred under subsection (1). After a claim is barred, it may be allowed and paid only if the estate is solvent and all successors whose interests would be affected consent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Upon the personal representative's or a claimant's commencement of a proceeding, the court may allow in whole or in part a claim properly presented in due time and not barred by subsection (1). Upon an interested person's petition concerning a personal representative's claim, the court may allow in whole or in part the personal representative's claim properly presented in due time and not previously allowed under subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A judgment in a proceeding in another court against a personal representative to enforce a claim against a decedent's estate constitutes an allowance of the claim.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Unless otherwise provided in a judgment in another court entered against the personal representative, an allowed claim bears interest at a rate determined under section 6013 of the revised judicature act of 1961, MCL 600.6013, for the period commencing 63 days after the time for the claim's original presentation expires unless based on a contract providing for interest, in which case the claim bears interest in accordance with the contract.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Subject to subsections (2) and (3) and except as provided in section 2301(3) or 2302(1)(b)(iv), distributees' shares abate, without a preference or priority between real and personal property, in the following order:</DIV>

Abatement within each classification is in proportion to the amount of property each beneficiary would have received if full distribution of the property had been made in accordance with the terms of the will.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A specific devisee is entitled to distribution of the property devised to him or her, and a spouse or child who selects particular estate property as provided in section 2404 shall receive the property selected.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   This section protects a purchaser from or lender to a distributee who, as personal representative, has executed a deed of distribution to himself or herself, as well as a purchaser from or lender to another distributee or his or her transferee. To be protected under this section, a purchaser or lender does not need to inquire whether a personal representative acted properly making the distribution in kind, even if the personal representative and the distributee are the same person, or whether the authority of the personal representative had terminated before the distribution.</DIV>

If there is, or may be, an interested person to the agreement who is a minor or incapacitated individual or if there is an inalienable estate or future contingent interest, after notice to the representative of the individual or interest as provided by supreme court rule, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may, if the agreement is made in good faith and appears just and reasonable for the individual or interest, direct the representative of the individual or interest to sign and enter into the agreement. The personal representative shall abide by the agreement's terms subject to the personal representative's obligation to administer the estate for the benefit of creditors, to pay all taxes and costs of administration, and to carry out the fiduciary office's responsibilities for the benefit of a successor of the decedent who is not a party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A personal representative of a decedent's estate is not required to see to the performance of a trust if the trustee of the trust is another person who is willing to accept the trust. Accordingly, a trustee of a trust created by will is a successor for the purposes of this section. Nothing in this section relieves a trustee of a duty owed to a trust beneficiary.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Before distributing to a trustee, the personal representative may require that the trust be registered if the state in which it is to be administered provides for registration and that the trustee inform the beneficiaries as provided in section 7814.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the terms of the trust do not excuse the trustee from giving bond, or if the trustee is not a financial institution qualified to do trust business in this state, the personal representative may petition the appropriate court to require that the trustee post bond if the personal representative reasonably believes that a bond is needed to protect the interests of the beneficiaries. A personal representative may withhold distribution until the court acts on the petition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An inference of negligence on the personal representative's part shall not be drawn from failure to exercise the authority conferred by subsections (1) and (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If it becomes necessary or convenient in the settlement or distribution of a decedent's estate to appoint a trustee to take charge of or invest and distribute a portion of the estate, the court may appoint a trustee upon the request of the personal representative or another interested person.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The county treasurer shall receive and safely keep money deposited under authority of this act in a separate fund and keep a separate account for each distributee or claim. The county treasurer shall deposit the money in a county depository at the current rate of interest, shall pay out from the fund upon the order of the court, and shall turn over any surplus left in the treasurer's hands at the termination of the treasurer's term of office to the treasurer's successor. The county treasurer shall, at the end of each year, render to the court, and to the county board of commissioners, a true account of that money.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) For the care of the money received under authority of this act, the county treasurer may take 1% from the different amounts paid out under court order unless the amount paid out to a single individual exceeds $1,500.00, in which case the county treasurer shall take $15.00 plus 1/2 of 1% of the excess of the amount over $1,500.00.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3920.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An estate, inheritance, or other death tax levied or assessed under the laws of this or another state, political subdivision, or country or under a United States revenue act concerning property included in the gross estate under the law, but excluding taxes for which sources of payment are provided within sections 2206, 2207, 2207A, 2207B, and 2603 of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 2206, 2207, 2207A, 2207B, and 2603, shall be apportioned in the following manner:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If a part of the property concerning which the tax is levied or assessed passed under a will, then, unless the governing instrument directs otherwise, the tax shall be charged as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   If any portion of that property passed under the will as a devise to be satisfied by reference to a specific property or type of property, fund, money, or other nonresiduary form, the net amount of the tax attributable to that portion shall be charged to and paid from the residuary estate without requiring contribution from a person receiving or benefiting from the nonresiduary interest and without apportionment among the residuary beneficiaries. If the residuary estate is insufficient to pay the tax attributable to all nonresiduary interests, the balance of the tax shall be apportioned pro rata among the recipients of those interests generating the tax based on the value of those interests.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   The net amount of a tax attributable to the residuary estate shall be apportioned pro rata among the residuary beneficiaries based on the value of the residuary interests generating the tax. If a residuary interest is a temporary interest, the tax attributable to it shall be charged to principal and not apportioned between temporary and remainder interests.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If a part of the property concerning which the tax is levied or assessed is held under the terms of an inter vivos trust, then, unless the governing instrument directs otherwise, the tax shall be charged as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   If a portion of the trust is directed to pass or to be held in further trust by reference to a specific property or type of property, fund, money, or other nonresiduary form, the net amount of the tax attributable to that portion shall be charged to and paid from the principal of the residuary share of the trust without requiring contribution from a person receiving or benefiting from the nonresiduary interest and without apportionment among the residuary beneficiaries. If the residuary share of the trust is insufficient to pay the tax attributable to all nonresiduary interests, the balance of the tax shall be apportioned pro rata among the recipients of those interests generating the tax based on the value of those interests.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   The net amount of tax attributable to the residuary share of the trust shall be charged as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)   The net amount of tax attributable to each residuary temporary interest shall be charged to that portion of residuary principal that supports the temporary interest without apportionment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(B)   The net amount of tax attributable to the balance of the residuary share shall be apportioned pro rata among the residuary beneficiaries by charge to the principal of their interest based on the value of the residuary interests.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Except as otherwise directed by the governing instrument, tax liability remaining after the application of subdivisions (a) and (b), including, but not limited to, a tax imposed with respect to property passing by beneficiary designation, survivorship, or intestacy, or to an annuity not created under a will or an inter vivos trust, shall be apportioned pro rata among, and paid by, the recipients and beneficiaries of the properties or interests, based on the value of the properties and interests generating the tax. Except as otherwise directed by the governing instrument, with respect to a temporary interest not in trust, the amount charged to the recipients or beneficiaries shall not be apportioned between temporary and remainder interests, but shall be charged to and paid out of the principal of the property or fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   As used in this section and sections 3921 to 3923:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Governing instrument" means a will, trust agreement, or other document that controls the devolution of property at death with respect to which the tax is being levied.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Net estate" means the gross estate, as defined by the estate, inheritance, or death tax law of the particular state, country, or political subdivision whose tax is being apportioned, less the deductions allowed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   "Temporary interest" means an interest in income or an estate for a specific period of time, for life, or for some other period controlled by reference to extrinsic events.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   "Value" means the pecuniary worth of the interest involved as finally determined for purposes of the tax then under consideration, without regard to a diminution of the interest by reason of the charge of a part of the tax.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3921.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Unless specific directions to that effect are contained in the governing instrument under which the fiduciary is acting, section 3920 shall not be construed to require the personal representative or other concerned fiduciary to pay an estate, inheritance, or other death tax levied or assessed by a foreign country.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The net amount of tax attributable to the interests encompassed by subdivision (a), subdivision (b), or subdivision (c) of section 3920(1) considered separately shall be the part of the net amount of tax as finally determined, with any interest and penalties on that amount, as the value of the interests generating the tax and included in the subdivision bears to the amount of the net estate. However, for an inheritance or similar tax, the tax that is imposed on each beneficiary's interest, as determined under the law of the state, country, or political subdivision then under consideration, shall be considered the tax attributable to the interest. In prorating taxes within each subdivision of section 3920(1) based on the value of those interests generating the tax, each separate tax that an interest may incur shall be prorated in the same manner. In determining the proportion that each interest bears to the total value of all interests generating each tax, only interests generating that particular tax are considered. Property or interests generating a tax do not include property or interests, whether passing under a will, trust, or otherwise, to the extent the property or interest is exempt or is initially deductible from the gross estate, without regard to any subsequent diminution of the deduction by reason of the charge of a part of the tax to the property or interest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A direction in a governing instrument for tax allocation and payment in a manner different from that provided in sections 3920 to 3923 is effective to allocate and pay tax only from property whose devolution is subject to that instrument's control and with respect to which the tax is being levied. If the governing instrument was signed on or after September 6, 1963 and before April 1, 2000 and directs apportionment of taxes by reference to the uniform estate tax apportionment act, which was former 1963 PA 144, or by reference to another law of this state that was in effect when the instrument was executed, the apportionment rules provided in the referenced law control the apportionment of taxes under that governing instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A direction to allocate and pay tax contained in a will is effective to allocate and pay tax even if the will does not control the devolution of property at death with respect to which the tax is being levied, including a direction in a will to allocate and pay tax from a trust of which the testator was the settlor and that was revocable by the settlor, or would have been revocable if the settlor was not incapacitated, until the settlor's death. If there is a conflict between directions in a will to allocate and pay tax and the terms of another governing instrument, the directions in the will control.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A tax apportionment based on the net estate under sections 3920 to 3923 shall be determined without regard to a diminution in deductions resulting from the charge of a part of the tax to a deductible interest.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3922.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Unless the governing instrument provides otherwise, if a credit is given under the United States estate tax laws for a tax paid to another country or a political subdivision, the credit shall be apportioned under sections 3920 to 3923 among the recipients or interests finally charged with the payment of the foreign tax in reduction of a United States estate tax chargeable to the recipients or interests, whether or not the United States estate tax is attributable to the foreign interests. An excess of the credit shall be applied in reduction of the part of United States estate tax chargeable to the residue, and an excess of the credit over the United States estate tax chargeable to the residue shall be apportioned pro rata among those persons or interests finally charged with the balance of the payment of United States estate tax.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Unless otherwise directed by the governing instrument, the personal representative shall pay the tax out of the estate, or if a personal representative is not acting under appointment, a person receiving or holding an interest generating the tax shall pay the tax. In a case in which property required to be included in the gross estate does not come into the personal representative's possession, the personal representative shall recover from the following persons the proportionate amount of tax chargeable to them under this act:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   From the fiduciary in possession of the trust principal or of property subject to the power of appointment in cases in which inter vivos trust property or property subject to a power of appointment is included in the gross estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   In all other cases, from the recipients or beneficiaries of property or interests with respect to which the tax is levied or assessed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Subsection (2) does not authorize the recovery of taxes from a company issuing insurance included in the gross estate, or from a bank, trust company, savings and loan association, or similar institution with respect to an account in the name of the decedent and another person that passed by operation of law on the decedent's death. If the fiduciary brings an action to recover a share of tax apportioned to an interest not within the fiduciary's control, the judgment that the fiduciary obtains may include costs and reasonable attorney fees.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A personal representative or other fiduciary is not required to transfer property until the amount of a tax due from the transferee is paid or, if apportionment of the tax has not been determined, until adequate security is furnished for the payment. The fiduciary is not required to distribute property that the fiduciary reasonably anticipates may be necessary to pay a state or federal tax and related interest or penalties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   On petition of the person required to pay a tax, the probate court having jurisdiction over the administration of a decedent's estate may determine the apportionment of the tax. If there are no probate proceedings, on the petition of a person required to pay a tax, the probate court of the county where the decedent was domiciled at death shall determine the apportionment of the tax.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   For the purpose of settling a claim as to which an action is not pending in another court for damages for wrongful death or for a claim existing under this state's laws relating to the survival of actions, if a personal representative petitions the court in writing asking leave to settle the claim and after notice to all persons who may be entitled to damages as provided in section 2922 of the revised judicature act of 1961, being section 600.2922 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, the court may conduct a hearing and approve or reject the settlement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The proceeds of a court settlement of a cause of action for wrongful death shall be distributed in accordance with all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The personal representative shall file with the court a petition for authority to distribute the proceeds. Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall order a hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Unless waived, notice of hearing must be given to all persons who may be entitled to damages as provided in section 2922 of the revised judicature act of 1961. A notice under this subdivision must contain both of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The name and address of the personal representative and of the personal representative's attorney.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   A statement that, to recover damages under this section, the person who may be entitled to damages must present a claim for damages to the personal representative on or before the date set for hearing on the petition for distribution of the proceeds, and that failure to present a claim for damages within the time provided bars the person from making a claim to any of the proceeds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If an interested person is a minor, disappeared person, or incapacitated individual for whom a fiduciary is not appointed, the court shall first appoint a fiduciary or guardian ad litem, and the notice as provided in subdivision (b) shall be given to the fiduciary or guardian ad litem.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   After a hearing on the personal representative's petition, the court shall order payment from the proceeds of the decedent's reasonable medical, hospital, funeral, and burial expenses for which the estate is liable. The proceeds shall not be applied to the payment of any other charges against the decedent's estate. The court shall then enter an order distributing the proceeds to those persons designated in section 2922 of the revised judicature act of 1961 who suffered damages and to the decedent's estate for compensation for conscious pain and suffering, if any, in the amount the court considers fair and equitable considering the relative damages sustained by each of the persons and the decedent's estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   If none of the persons entitled to the proceeds is a minor, disappeared person, or legally incapacitated individual and all of the persons entitled to the proceeds execute a sworn stipulation or agreement in writing in which each person's portion of the proceeds is specified, the court order shall be entered in accordance with the stipulation or agreement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   A person who may be entitled to damages under this section must present a claim for damages to the personal representative on or before the date set for hearing on the petition for distribution of the proceeds.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the personal representative does not complete estate administration within 1 year after the original appointment by petitioning for a settlement order under section 3952 or 3953 or by filing a sworn statement under section 3954, the personal representative shall file with the court and send to all interested persons a notice that the estate remains under administration and specifying the reason for continuation of administration. This notice of continued administration must be filed not later than 28 days after the anniversary of the personal representative's appointment and, if administration remains incomplete, not later than 28 days after each subsequent anniversary of the appointment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the notice described in subsection (1) is not filed, an interested person may petition the court for a hearing on the necessity for continued administration or petition for a settlement order under either section 3952 or 3953. In response to such a petition, the court may issue appropriate orders to assure prompt estate settlement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the notice described in subsection (1) is not filed and an interested person's petition is not pending, the court may notify the personal representative and all interested persons that the court will close the estate administration and terminate the personal representative's authority within 63 days unless within that time period any of the following occur:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The personal representative files a notice under subsection (1), a petition for settlement under either section 3952 or 3953, or a sworn statement under section 3954.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A personal representative or an interested person may petition for an order of complete estate settlement. The personal representative may petition at any time, and an interested person may petition after 1 year from the original personal representative's appointment. However, the court shall not accept a petition under this section until the time expires for presenting a claim that arises before the decedent's death.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A petition under this section may request the court to determine testacy, if not previously determined, to consider the final account, to compel or approve an accounting and distribution, to construe a will or determine heirs, and to adjudicate the estate's final settlement and distribution. After notice to all interested persons and a hearing, the court may enter an order or orders, on appropriate conditions, determining the persons entitled to distribution of the estate, and as circumstances require, approving settlement, directing or approving estate distribution, and discharging the personal representative from further claim or demand of an interested person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If 1 or more heirs or devisees were omitted as parties in, or were not given notice of, a previous formal testacy proceeding, on proper petition for an order of complete estate settlement under this section and after notice to the omitted or unnotified persons and other interested persons determined to be interested on the assumption that the previous order concerning testacy is conclusive as to those given notice of the earlier proceeding, the court may determine testacy as it affects the omitted persons, and confirm or alter the previous testacy order as it affects all interested persons as appropriate in the light of the new proofs. In the absence of objection by an omitted or unnotified person, evidence received in the original testacy proceeding constitutes prima facie proof of due execution of a will previously admitted to probate, or of the fact that the decedent left no valid will if the prior proceeding determined this fact.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A personal representative administering an estate under an informally probated will or a devisee under an informally probated will may petition for a settlement order for the estate that does not adjudicate the decedent's testacy status. The personal representative may petition at any time, and a devisee may petition after 1 year after the original personal representative's appointment. However, the court shall not accept a petition under this section until the time expires for presenting a claim that arises before the decedent's death.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A petition under this section may request the court to consider the final account, to compel or approve an accounting and distribution, to construe the will, or to adjudicate the estate's final settlement and distribution. After notice to all devisees and the personal representative and a hearing, the court may enter appropriate orders, on appropriate conditions, determining the persons entitled to distribution of the estate under the will, and, as circumstances require, approving settlement, directing or approving estate distribution, and discharging the personal representative from further claim or demand of a devisee who is a party to the proceeding and those the devisee represents. If it appears that a part of the estate is intestate, the proceedings shall be dismissed or amendments made to meet the provisions of section 3952.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3954.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Unless prohibited by court order and except for an estate being administered in a supervised administration proceeding, a personal representative may close an estate by filing with the court, no earlier than 5 months after the date of a general personal representative's original appointment, a sworn statement stating that the personal representative or a previous personal representative has done all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Determined that notice was published and the time limited for presentation of creditors claims has expired.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Fully administered the decedent's estate by making payment, settlement, or other disposition of all claims that were presented, of administration and estate expenses, and of estate, inheritance, and other death taxes, except as specified in the statement, including distribution of the estate property to the persons entitled. If a claim remains undischarged, the statement shall state whether the personal representative distributed the estate subject to possible liability with the distributee's agreement or shall state in detail other arrangements that have been made to accommodate outstanding liabilities.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Sent a copy of the statement to all estate distributees and to all creditors or other claimants of whom the personal representative is aware whose claims are neither paid nor barred.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Furnished a full account in writing of the personal representative's administration to the distributees whose interests are affected by the administration.

</P>
<P>Sec. 3955.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   After estate property is distributed and subject to section 3957, an undischarged claim not barred may be prosecuted in a proceeding against 1 or more distributees. A distributee is not liable to a claimant for an amount received as exempt property or as a homestead or family allowance, or for an amount in excess of the value of the distributee's distribution as of the time of distribution. As between distributees, each shall bear the cost of satisfaction of an unbarred claim as if the claim had been satisfied in the course of administration. If a distributee fails to notify other distributees of the demand made upon the distributee by the claimant in sufficient time to permit them to join in a proceeding in which the claim is asserted, the distributee loses the right of contribution against other distributees.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The court shall only appoint a professional guardian or professional conservator as authorized under subsection (1) if the court finds on the record all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The appointment of the professional guardian or professional conservator is in the ward's, developmentally disabled individual's, incapacitated individual's, or protected individual's best interests.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) There is no other person that is competent, suitable, and willing to serve in that fiduciary capacity in accordance with section 5212, 5313, or 5409.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A professional guardian or professional conservator appointed under this section shall not receive as a result of that appointment a benefit beyond compensation specifically authorized for that type of fiduciary by this act or the mental health code, 1974 PA 258, MCL 330.1001 to 330.2106. This subsection does not prevent a person from providing compensation or other benefits, from a source other than the estate of the ward, developmentally disabled individual, incapacitated individual, or protected individual, to a professional guardian or professional conservator appointed or approved under this section. If a professional guardian or professional conservator appointed or approved under this section receives or is to receive compensation or other benefits as a result of that appointment from a person other than this state, a political subdivision of this state, or a trust created under section 5407(2), the professional guardian or professional conservator shall file with the appointing or approving court a written statement of the compensation or other benefit received or to be received, including the source of the compensation or other benefit, in a form and in a manner prescribed by the Michigan court rules.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A professional guardian appointed under this section shall establish and maintain a schedule of visitation so that an individual associated with the professional guardian who is responsible for the ward's care visits the ward within 3 months after the professional guardian's appointment and not less than once within 3 months after each previous visit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A professional guardian appointed under this section shall ensure that there are a sufficient number of employees assigned to the care of wards for the purpose of performing the necessary duties associated with ensuring that proper and appropriate care is provided.</div>

The authorization under this subsection confers the fiduciary capacity only to the extent necessary in the particular matter of each appointment and is not a general grant of fiduciary authority. A nonbanking corporation is not authorized to act in any other fiduciary capacity.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 5213.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The petitioner shall give notice of the time and place of hearing of a petition for the appointment of a minor's guardian to each of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The minor, if 14 years of age or older.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The person who had the principal care and custody of the minor during the 63 days preceding the date of the petition.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Each living parent of the minor or, if neither of them is living, the adult nearest of kin to the minor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Upon hearing, if the court finds that a qualified person seeks appointment, venue is proper, the required notices have been given, the requirements of section 5204 or of sections 5205 and 5206 are satisfied, and the minor's welfare will be served by the requested appointment, the court shall make the appointment. In other cases, the court may dismiss the proceeding or make another disposition of the matter that will serve the minor's welfare.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If necessary, the court may appoint a temporary guardian with the status of an ordinary guardian of a minor, but the temporary guardian's authority shall not exceed 6 months.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If, at any time in the proceeding, the court determines that the minor's interests are or may be inadequately represented, the court may appoint a lawyer-guardian ad litem to represent the minor, giving a consideration to the preference of the minor if the minor is 14 years of age or older.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A lawyer-guardian ad litem appointed under this act represents the child and has powers and duties in relation to that representation as set forth in section 17d of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.17d. All provisions of section 17d of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.17d, apply to a lawyer-guardian ad litem appointed under this act. In addition, both of the following apply under this act:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   In a proceeding in which a lawyer-guardian ad litem represents a child, he or she may file a written report and recommendation. The court may read the report and recommendation. The court shall not, however, admit the report and recommendation into evidence unless all parties stipulate the admission. The parties may make use of the report and recommendation for purposes of a settlement conference.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   After a determination of ability to pay, the court may assess all or part of the costs and reasonable fees of a lawyer-guardian ad litem against 1 or more of the parties involved in the proceedings or against the money allocated from marriage license fees for family counseling services under section 3 of 1887 PA 128, MCL 551.103. A lawyer-guardian ad litem shall not be paid a fee unless the court first reviews and approves the fee.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>A minor's guardian has the powers and responsibilities of a parent who is not deprived of custody of the parent's minor and unemancipated child, except that a guardian is not legally obligated to provide for the ward from the guardian's own money and is not liable to third persons because of the parental relationship for the ward's acts. A guardian has all of the following powers and duties:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The guardian shall take reasonable care of a ward's personal effects and commence a protective proceeding if necessary to protect the ward's other property. If a guardian commences a protective proceeding because the guardian believes that it is in the ward's best interest to sell or otherwise dispose of the ward's real property or interest in real property, the court may appoint the guardian as special conservator and authorize the special conservator to proceed under section 5423(3). A guardian shall not otherwise sell the ward's real property or interest in real property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The guardian may receive money payable for the ward's support to the ward's parent, guardian, or custodian under the terms of a statutory benefit or insurance system, or a private contract, devise, trust, conservatorship, or custodianship. The guardian may receive the ward's money or property paid or delivered under section 5102. Money or property received under section 5102 must be applied to the ward's current needs for support, care, and education. The guardian shall exercise due care to conserve any excess for the ward's future needs unless a conservator is appointed for the ward's estate, in which case the excess must be paid over at least annually to the conservator. The guardian shall not use that money or property for compensation for the guardian's services except as approved by court order or as determined by an appointed conservator other than the guardian. A guardian may institute a proceeding to compel a person's performance of a duty to support the ward or to pay money for the ward's welfare.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The guardian shall facilitate the ward's education and social or other activities, and shall authorize medical or other professional care, treatment, or advice. A guardian is not liable because of this consent for injury to the ward resulting from the negligence or acts of third persons unless it would be illegal for a parent to have consented.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Subject to the conditions and restrictions of chapter X of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 710.21 to 710.70, a guardian may consent to adoption of a minor ward or to the release of a minor ward for adoption.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A guardian must report the condition of the ward and of the ward's estate that is subject to the guardian's possession or control as ordered by the court on petition of a person interested in the minor's welfare or as required by court rule. The report must detail the condition of the ward, medical or mental health treatment or care to which the ward was subjected, and what reason, if any, exists for the continuation of the guardianship.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Within 14 days after a change in the ward's place of residence, the guardian shall give to the court notice of the ward's new address.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) A guardian may execute a do-not-resuscitate order on behalf of the ward as provided in section 3a of the Michigan do-not-resuscitate procedure act, 1996 PA 193, MCL 333.1053a.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>A guardian's authority and responsibility terminate upon the guardian's death, resignation, or removal or upon the minor's death, adoption, marriage, or attainment of majority. However, a termination does not affect the guardian's liability for prior acts or the obligation to account for the ward's money and property. The guardian's resignation does not terminate the guardianship until it is approved by the court. A parental appointment under an unprobated or informally probated will terminates if the will is later denied probate in a formal proceeding.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The court at the place where the ward resides has concurrent jurisdiction over resignation, removal, accounting, or another proceeding relating to the guardianship with the court that appointed the guardian or in which acceptance of a parental appointment was filed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the court located where the ward resides is neither the appointing court nor the court in which acceptance of appointment is filed, the court in which a proceeding subsequent to appointment is commenced in all appropriate cases shall notify the other court, in this or another state, and after consultation with that court, shall determine whether to retain jurisdiction or transfer the proceeding to the other court, whichever will serve the ward's welfare. A copy of an order accepting a resignation or removing a guardian shall be sent to the appointing court or the court in which acceptance of appointment is filed.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A person interested in a ward's welfare or, if 14 years of age or older, the ward may petition for the removal of a guardian on the ground that removal would serve the ward's welfare or for another order that would serve the ward's welfare. A guardian may petition for permission to resign. A petition for removal or for permission to resign may, but need not, include a request for a successor guardian's appointment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Notice of a hearing on a petition for an order after a guardian's appointment must be given to the ward, the guardian, and any other person as ordered by the court or as provided by court rule.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If serving as guardian, the parent of an unmarried legally incapacitated individual may appoint by will, or other writing signed by the parent and attested by at least 2 witnesses, a guardian for the legally incapacitated individual. If both parents are dead or the surviving parent is adjudged legally incapacitated, and no standby guardian has been appointed under section 5301c, a parental appointment by will or other writing becomes effective when, after having given 7 days' prior written notice of intention to do so to the legally incapacitated individual and to the person having the care of the legally incapacitated individual or to the nearest adult relative, the guardian files acceptance of appointment in the court in which the will containing the nomination is probated or, if the nomination is contained in a nontestamentary nominating instrument or the testator who made the nomination is not deceased, when the guardian's acceptance is filed in the court at the place where the legally incapacitated individual resides or is present. The notice must state that the appointment may be terminated by filing a written objection in the court as provided by subsection (4). If both parents are dead, an effective appointment by the parent who died later has priority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If serving as guardian, the spouse of a married legally incapacitated individual may appoint by will, or other writing signed by the spouse and attested by at least 2 witnesses, a guardian of the legally incapacitated individual.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) At a hearing convened under this part, the court may designate 1 or more standby guardians. The court may designate as standby guardian a competent person that is suitable and willing to serve in the order of priority under section 5313.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The nominated standby guardian must receive a copy of the petition nominating the person to serve, the court order establishing or modifying guardianship, and the order designating the standby guardian.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A standby guardian shall file an acceptance of the person's designation under subsection (2) within 28 days after receiving notice of the order designating the standby guardian.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the standby guardian is unable or unwilling to serve, the standby guardian shall promptly notify the court and interested persons in writing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A standby guardian does not have authority to act unless the guardian is unavailable for any reason, including any of the following:</div>

A person may rely on the standby guardian's representation that the standby guardian has the authority to act if the person is given the order issued under subsection (2) and acceptance filed under subsection (3). A person that acts in reliance on the representations and documentation described in this subsection without knowledge that the representations are incorrect is not liable to any person for so acting and may assume without further inquiry the existence of the standby guardian's authority.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The court may appoint a guardian if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence both that the individual for whom a guardian is sought is an incapacitated individual and that the appointment is necessary as a means of providing continuing care and supervision of the incapacitated individual, with each finding supported separately on the record. Alternately, the court may dismiss the proceeding or enter another appropriate order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The court shall grant a guardian only those powers and only for that period of time as is necessary to provide for the demonstrated need of the incapacitated individual. The court shall design the guardianship to encourage the development of maximum self-reliance and independence in the individual. If the court is aware that an individual has executed a patient advocate designation under section 5506, the court shall not grant a guardian any of the same powers that are held by the patient advocate. A court order establishing a guardianship shall specify any limitations on the guardian's powers and any time limits on the guardianship.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that an individual is incapacitated and lacks the capacity to do some, but not all, of the tasks necessary to care for himself or herself, the court may appoint a limited guardian to provide guardianship services to the individual, but the court shall not appoint a full guardian.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is incapacitated and is totally without capacity to care for himself or herself, the court shall specify that finding of fact in an order and may appoint a full guardian.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If an individual executed a patient advocate designation under section 5506 before the time the court determines that he or she became a legally incapacitated individual, a guardian does not have and shall not exercise the power or duty of making medical or mental health treatment decisions that the patient advocate is designated to make. If, however, a petition for guardianship or for modification under section 5310 alleges and the court finds that the patient advocate designation was not executed in compliance with section 5506, that the patient advocate is not complying with the terms of the designation or with the applicable provisions of sections 5506 to 5515, or that the patient advocate is not acting consistent with the ward's best interests, the court may modify the guardianship's terms to grant those powers to the guardian.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is incapacitated, that the person that has the care and custody of the incapacitated individual denied another person access to the incapacitated individual, and that the incapacitated individual desires contact with the other person or that contact with the other person is in the incapacitated individual's best interest, the court may appoint a limited guardian to supervise access with the other person.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>700.5314 Powers and duties of guardian.</B><P>Sec. 5314.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>If meaningful communication is possible, a legally incapacitated individual's guardian shall consult with the legally incapacitated individual before making a major decision affecting the legally incapacitated individual. To the extent a guardian of a legally incapacitated individual is granted powers by the court under section 5306, the guardian is responsible for the ward's care, custody, and control, but is not liable to third persons because of that responsibility for the ward's acts. In particular and without qualifying the previous sentences, a guardian has all of the following powers and duties, to the extent granted by court order:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The custody of the person of the ward and the power to establish the ward's place of residence in or outside this state. The guardian shall visit the ward within 3 months after the guardian's appointment and not less than once within 3 months after each previous visit. The guardian shall notify the court within 14 days of a change in the ward's place of residence or a change in the guardian's place of residence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If entitled to custody of the ward, the duty to make provision for the ward's care, comfort, and maintenance and, when appropriate, arrange for the ward's training and education. The guardian shall secure services to restore the ward to the best possible state of mental and physical well-being so that the ward can return to self-management at the earliest possible time. Without regard to custodial rights of the ward's person, the guardian shall take reasonable care of the ward's clothing, furniture, vehicles, and other personal effects and commence a protective proceeding if the ward's other property needs protection. If a guardian commences a protective proceeding because the guardian believes that it is in the ward's best interest to sell or otherwise dispose of the ward's real property or interest in real property, the court may appoint the guardian as special conservator and authorize the special conservator to proceed under section 5423(3). A guardian shall not otherwise sell the ward's real property or interest in real property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The power to give the consent or approval that is necessary to enable the ward to receive medical, mental health, or other professional care, counsel, treatment, or service. However, a guardian does not have and shall not exercise the power to give the consent to or approval for inpatient hospitalization unless the court expressly grants the power in its order. If the ward objects or actively refuses mental health treatment, the guardian or any other interested person must follow the procedures provided in chapter 4 of the mental health code, 1974 PA 258, MCL 330.1400 to 330.1490, to petition the court for an order to provide involuntary mental health treatment. The power of a guardian to execute a do-not-resuscitate order under subdivision (d), execute a nonopioid directive form under subdivision (f), or execute a physician orders for scope of treatment form under subdivision (g) does not affect or limit the power of a guardian to consent to a physician's order to withhold resuscitative measures in a hospital. As used in this subdivision, "involuntary mental health treatment" means that term as defined in section 400 of the mental health code, 1974 PA 258, MCL 330.1400.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The power to execute, reaffirm, and revoke a do-not-resuscitate order on behalf of a ward. However, a guardian shall not execute a do-not-resuscitate order unless the guardian does all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Not more than 14 days before executing the do-not-resuscitate order, visits the ward and, if meaningful communication is possible, consults with the ward about executing the do-not-resuscitate order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Consults directly with the ward's attending physician as to the specific medical indications that warrant the do-not-resuscitate order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If a guardian executes a do-not-resuscitate order under subdivision (d), not less than annually after the do-not-resuscitate order is first executed, the duty to do all of the following: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Visit the ward and, if meaningful communication is possible, consult with the ward about reaffirming the do-not-resuscitate order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Consult directly with the ward's attending physician as to specific medical indications that may warrant reaffirming the do-not-resuscitate order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The power to execute, reaffirm, and revoke a nonopioid directive form on behalf of a ward.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The power to execute, reaffirm, and revoke a physician orders for scope of treatment form on behalf of a ward. However, a guardian shall not execute a physician orders for scope of treatment form unless the guardian does all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Not more than 14 days before executing the physician orders for scope of treatment form, visits the ward and, if meaningful communication is possible, consults with the ward about executing the physician orders for scope of treatment form.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Consults directly with the ward's attending physician as to the specific medical indications that warrant the physician orders for scope of treatment form.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) If a guardian executes a physician orders for scope of treatment form under subdivision (g), not less than annually after the physician orders for scope of treatment form is first executed, the duty to do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Visit the ward and, if meaningful communication is possible, consult with the ward about reaffirming the physician orders for scope of treatment form.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Consult directly with the ward's attending physician as to specific medical indications that may warrant reaffirming the physician orders for scope of treatment form.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If a conservator for the ward's estate is not appointed, the power to do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Institute a proceeding to compel a person under a duty to support the ward or to pay money for the ward's welfare to perform that duty.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Receive money and tangible property deliverable to the ward and apply the money and property for the ward's support, care, and education. The guardian shall not use money from the ward's estate for room and board that the guardian or the guardian's spouse, parent, or child have furnished the ward unless a charge for the service is approved by court order made on notice to at least 1 of the ward's next of kin, if notice is possible. The guardian shall exercise care to conserve any excess for the ward's needs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) The duty to report the condition of the ward and the ward's estate that is subject to the guardian's possession or control, as required by the court, but not less often than annually. The guardian shall also serve the report required under this subdivision on the ward and interested persons as specified in the Michigan court rules. A report under this subdivision must contain all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The ward's current mental, physical, and social condition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Improvement or deterioration in the ward's mental, physical, and social condition that occurred during the past year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The ward's present living arrangement and changes in the ward's living arrangement that occurred during the past year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Whether the guardian recommends a more suitable living arrangement for the ward.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Medical treatment, including mental health treatment, received by the ward.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) Whether the guardian has executed, reaffirmed, or revoked a do-not-resuscitate order on behalf of the ward during the past year.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) To the extent granted by the court under section 5306, the guardian of an individual for whom a conservator also is appointed controls the ward's custody and care and is entitled to receive reasonable amounts for those services and for room and board furnished to the ward as agreed upon between the guardian and the conservator if the amounts agreed upon are reasonable under the circumstances.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a ward dies while under guardianship and a conservator has not been appointed for the ward's estate and if the guardian has possession of money of the deceased ward, upon petition of the guardian and with or without notice, the court may hear a claim for burial expenses or any other claim as the court considers advisable. Upon hearing the claim, the court may enter an order allowing or disallowing the claim or a part of the claim and may provide in the order of allowance that the claim or a part of it be paid immediately if the payment can be made without injury or serious inconvenience to the ward's estate.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the court in the county where the ward resides is not the court in which acceptance of appointment is filed, the court in which a proceeding is commenced after the appointment in appropriate cases shall notify the other court, in this or another state, and after consultation with that court, shall determine whether to retain jurisdiction or transfer the proceeding to the other court, whichever is in the best interests of the ward. After this determination is made, the court accepting a resignation or removing a guardian shall direct this fiduciary to prepare and submit a final report to both courts. A copy of an order accepting a resignation or removing a guardian and a copy of the final report must be sent to the court in which acceptance of appointment is filed. The court entering this order may permit closing of the guardianship in the court in which acceptance of appointment is filed, without notice to interested persons.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 5406.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Upon receipt of a petition for a conservator's appointment or another protective order because of minority, the court shall set a date for hearing. If, at any time in the proceeding, the court determines that the minor's interests are or may be inadequately represented, the court may appoint an attorney to represent the minor, giving consideration to the minor's choice if 14 years of age or older. An attorney appointed by the court to represent a minor has the powers and duties of a guardian ad litem.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Upon receipt of a petition for a conservator's appointment or another protective order for a reason other than minority, the court shall set a date for hearing. Unless the individual to be protected has chosen counsel, or is mentally competent but aged or physically infirm, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the person in the proceeding. If the alleged disability is mental illness, mental deficiency, physical illness or disability, chronic use of drugs, or chronic intoxication, the court may direct that the individual alleged to need protection be examined by a physician or mental health professional appointed by the court, preferably a physician or mental health professional who is not connected with an institution in which the individual is a patient or is detained. The individual alleged to need protection has the right to secure an independent evaluation at his or her own expense. The court may send a visitor to interview the individual to be protected. The visitor may be a guardian ad litem or a court officer or employee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The court may utilize, as an additional visitor, the service of a public or charitable agency to evaluate the condition of the individual to be protected and make appropriate recommendations to the court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A guardian ad litem, physician, mental health professional, or visitor appointed under this section who meets with, examines, or evaluates an individual who is the subject of a petition in a protective proceeding shall do all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Consider whether there is an appropriate alternative to a conservatorship.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If a conservatorship is appropriate, consider the desirability of limiting the scope and duration of the conservator's authority.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Report to the court based on the considerations required in subdivisions (a) and (b).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The individual to be protected is entitled to be present at the hearing in person. If the individual wishes to be present at the hearing, all practical steps must be taken to ensure the individual's presence including, if necessary, moving the site of the hearing. The individual is entitled to be represented by counsel, to present evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, including a court-appointed physician or other qualified person and a visitor, and to trial by jury. The issue may be determined at a closed hearing or without a jury if the individual to be protected or counsel for the individual so requests.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Any person may request for permission to participate in the proceeding, and the court may grant the request, with or without hearing, upon determining that the best interest of the individual to be protected will be served by granting the request. The court may attach appropriate conditions to the permission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   After hearing, upon finding that a basis for a conservator's appointment or another protective order is established by clear and convincing evidence, the court shall make the appointment or other appropriate protective order.</DIV>

Accordingly, the court may authorize a protected individual to function without the consent or supervision of the individual's conservator in handling part of his or her money or property, including authorizing the individual to maintain an account with a financial institution.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) After hearing and upon determining that a basis for an appointment or other protective order exists with respect to an individual for a reason other than minority, the court, for the benefit of the individual and members of the individual's immediate family, has all the powers over the estate and business affairs that the individual could exercise if present and not under disability, except the power to make a will. Those powers include, but are not limited to, all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) To make gifts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) To convey or release a contingent or expectant interest in property including marital property rights and a right of survivorship incident to joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) To exercise or release a power held by the protected individual as personal representative, custodian for a minor, conservator, or donee of a power of appointment.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) To create a revocable or irrevocable trust of estate property that may extend beyond the disability or life of the protected individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) To exercise an option of the protected individual to purchase securities or other property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vii) To exercise a right to elect an option and change a beneficiary under an insurance or annuity policy and to surrender the policy for its cash value.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(viii) To exercise a right to an elective share in the estate of the individual's deceased spouse.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ix) To renounce or disclaim an interest by testate or intestate succession or by inter vivos transfer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The court may exercise or direct the exercise of the following powers only if satisfied, after the notice and hearing, that it is in the protected individual's best interests and that the individual either is incapable of consenting or has consented to the proposed exercise of the power:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) To exercise or release a power of appointment of which the protected individual is donee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) To renounce or disclaim an interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) To make a gift in trust or otherwise exceeding 20% of a year's income of the estate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) To change a beneficiary under an insurance and annuity policy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A determination that a basis for a conservator's appointment or another protective order exists has no effect on the protected individual's capacity.</div>

<P>Sec. 5412.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Before receiving letters, a conservator must qualify by filing with the appointing court a required bond and a statement of acceptance of the duties of the office.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In filing the statement of acceptance, the conservator may exclude from the scope of the conservator's responsibility, for a period not exceeding 91 days, real estate or an ownership interest in a business entity if the conservator reasonably believes the real estate or property owned by the business entity is or may be contaminated by a hazardous substance, or is or has been used for an activity directly or indirectly involving a hazardous substance that could result in liability to the estate or otherwise impair the value of property held in the estate. The conservator shall identify the real estate or ownership interest being excluded and specify the time period of exclusion.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the conservator identifies excluded property under subsection (2), the conservator's responsibilities extend to the excluded property at the end of the exclusion period or upon prior notice of acceptance of that property filed by the conservator with the court, unless, before the end of the exclusion period, the conservator requests the court to appoint a special conservator with respect to the excluded property or to exercise administrative authority over the excluded property by direct judicial order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In response to a request by the general conservator under subsection (3), the court may do either of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Appoint a special conservator with the duty and authority to collect and manage the excluded property, but only to the extent necessary for proper settlement of the estate, to preserve the property, to account with respect to the property, and to distribute or otherwise dispose of the property as directed by the general conservator or other court order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Direct administration of the excluded property by judicial order without the appointment of a conservator with respect to the property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   By accepting appointment, a conservator submits personally to the court's jurisdiction in a proceeding relating to the estate that may be instituted by an interested person. Notice of a proceeding shall be delivered to the conservator or mailed by registered or certified mail to the address listed in the petition for appointment or as reported to the court after appointment and to the address as then known to the petitioner.</DIV>

On termination of the protected individual's minority or disability, a conservator shall account to the court or to the formerly protected individual or that individual's successors. Subject to appeal or vacation within the time permitted, an order, after notice and hearing, allowing an intermediate account of a conservator adjudicates as to liabilities concerning the matters considered in connection with the accounts, and an order, after notice and hearing, allowing a final account adjudicates as to all previously unsettled liabilities of the conservator to the protected individual or the protected individual's successors relating to the conservatorship.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Appointment of a conservator vests in the conservator title as trustee to all of the protected individual's property, or to the part of that property specified in the order, held at the time of or acquired after the order, including title to property held for the protected individual by a custodian or attorney-in-fact.

Though ineffective to affect property rights, an attempted transfer or assignment by the protected individual may generate a claim for restitution or damages that, subject to presentation and allowance, may be satisfied as provided in section 5429.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Property vested in a conservator by this section and the protected individual's interest in that property is not subject to levy, garnishment, or similar process other than an order issued in the protective proceeding made as provided in section 5429.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A sale, encumbrance, or other transaction involving the investment or management of estate property in which the conservator has a substantial beneficial interest or that is otherwise affected by a substantial conflict between the conservator's fiduciary and personal interests, is voidable unless any of the following are true:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The transaction is approved by the court after notice as directed by the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The transaction involves a contract entered into or claim acquired by the conservator before the person became or contemplated becoming conservator.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A transaction not concerning estate property in which the conservator engages in the conservator's individual capacity involves a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests if the transaction concerns an opportunity properly belonging to the estate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An investment by a conservator in securities of an investment company or investment trust to which the conservator, or its affiliate, provides services in a capacity other than as conservator is not presumed to be affected by a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests if the investment otherwise complies with the Michigan prudent investor rule. In addition to its compensation for acting as conservator, the conservator may be compensated by the investment company or investment trust for providing those services out of fees charged to the estate.

Except as provided in subsection (3), the fact that a person knowingly deals with a conservator does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise, but a restriction on a conservator's powers that is endorsed on letters as provided in section 5427 is effective as to third persons. A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate property paid or delivered to a conservator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The protection expressed in this section extends to a procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect that occurs in a proceeding leading to the issuance of letters and is not a substitution for protection provided by a comparable provision of the law relating to a commercial transaction or to simplifying a transfer of securities by a fiduciary.</div>

Unless the order has been recorded or a person to whom an interest in the real estate is transferred has been given a copy of the order, the person is not entitled to presume that the conservator has the power to sell or otherwise dispose of the real property, or to mortgage, pledge, or cause a lien to be placed on the protected individual's real property, as applicable.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(s) Borrow money to be repaid from estate property or otherwise.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(t) Advance money for the protection of the estate or the protected individual, and for all expense, loss, or liability sustained in the estate's administration or because of the holding or ownership of estate property.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Disclaim a power granted by a document, statute, or rule of law that, in the sole discretion of the conservator, may cause the conservator to incur personal liability under an environmental law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Decline to serve or resign as a conservator if the conservator reasonably believes that there is or may be a conflict of interest between the conservator in its fiduciary capacity and in its individual capacity because of a potential claim or liability that may be asserted against the conservator on behalf of the estate because of the type or condition of property held in the estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Charge the cost of an inspection, review, abatement, response, cleanup, claim settlement, or remedial action authorized in this section against the estate income or principal.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The powers listed in subsection (1) are by way of enumeration and not limitation on the conservator's power to respond to an environmental concern or hazard.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A conservator is not personally liable to a beneficiary or other party for a decrease in the value of estate property by reason of the conservator's compliance with an environmental law, specifically including a reporting requirement under such a law. Neither the acceptance by the conservator of property nor a failure by the conservator to inspect property or a business operation creates an inference that there is or may be liability under an environmental law with respect to the property or business operation. The authority granted by this section is solely to facilitate the administration and protection of estate property and is not to impose greater responsibility or liability on the conservator than imposed by law absent these provisions.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A conservator may expend or distribute estate income or principal without court authorization or confirmation for the support, education, care, or benefit of the protected individual or the protected individual's dependents in accordance with the following principles:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The conservator shall consider a recommendation relating to the appropriate standard of support, education, and benefit for the protected individual or a dependent made by a parent or guardian, if any. The conservator shall not be surcharged for money paid to a person or organization furnishing support, education, or care to the protected individual or a dependent in compliance with the recommendation of the protected individual's parent or guardian unless the conservator knows that the parent or guardian derives personal financial benefit from that payment, including a benefit by relief from a personal duty of support, or that the recommendation is clearly not in the protected individual's best interests.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The conservator shall expend or distribute money reasonably necessary for the support, education, care, or benefit of the protected individual or a dependent with due regard to all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The estate size, the conservatorship's probable duration, and the likelihood that the protected individual, at some future time, may be fully able to be wholly self-sufficient and able to manage business affairs and the estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   The accustomed standard of living of the protected individual and the dependents.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   Other money or sources used for the protected individual's support.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The conservator may expend estate money for the support of an individual legally dependent on the protected individual and others who are members of the protected individual's household who are unable to support themselves and who are in need of support.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The conservator may pay money to be expended under this section to any person, including the protected individual, to reimburse for an expenditure that the conservator might have made or in advance for a service to be rendered to the protected individual, if it is reasonable to expect the service will be performed and an advance payment is customary or reasonably necessary under the circumstances.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   In discharging a responsibility conferred by court order or this part, a conservator shall implement the principles described in section 5407(1) to the extent possible.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 5426.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the estate is more than sufficient to provide for the purposes implicit in the distributions authorized by section 5425, a conservator for the protected individual, other than a minor, has the power to make a gift to charity or another object, as the protected individual might have been expected to make, in amounts that do not exceed an annual total of 20% of the estate income.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a minor who has not been adjudged disabled under section 5401(3) attains majority, after the conservator meets all claims and expenses of administration and accounts to the court if required to do so by the court or by court rule, the conservator shall pay over and distribute all money and property to the formerly protected individual as soon as possible.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If satisfied that a protected individual's disability, other than minority, has ceased, and after meeting all claims and expenses of administration, the conservator shall pay over and distribute all money and property to the formerly protected individual as soon as possible.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a protected individual dies, the conservator shall deliver to the court for safekeeping a will of the deceased protected individual that has come into the conservator's possession, shall inform the personal representative or a beneficiary named in the will of the delivery, and shall retain the estate for delivery to a duly appointed personal representative of the decedent or another person entitled to the delivery. If within 42 days after the protected individual's death another person is not appointed personal representative and an application or petition for appointment is not before the court, the conservator may petition to exercise a personal representative's powers and duties in order to be able to proceed to administer and distribute the decedent's estate. Upon petition for an order granting a personal representative's powers to a conservator, after notice to a person nominated as personal representative by a will of which the petitioner is aware and after notice as described in section 1401, the court may grant the petition upon determining that there is no objection and may endorse the letters of the conservator to note that the formerly protected individual is deceased and that the conservator has all of the powers and duties of a personal representative. An order made and entered under this section has the effect of an order for a personal representative's appointment as provided in section 3307 and parts 6 to 10 of article III. However, after administration, the estate in the conservator's name may be distributed to the decedent's successors without prior retransfer to the conservator as personal representative.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A conservator may pay or secure from the estate a claim against the estate or against the protected individual arising before or during the conservatorship upon the presentation of the claim and allowance in accordance with the priorities in subsection (4). A claim may be presented by either of the following methods:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The claimant may deliver or mail to the conservator a written statement of the claim indicating its basis, the name and mailing address of the claimant, and the amount claimed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The claimant may file a written statement of the claim with the court in the form prescribed by court rule and may deliver or mail a copy of the statement to the conservator.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The court shall consider a claim presented when the conservator receives the written statement of claim or when the claim is filed with the court, whichever happens first. A presented claim is allowed if it is not disallowed by written statement mailed by the conservator to the claimant within 63 days after the presentation of the claim. The presentation of a claim tolls a statute of limitations relating to the claim until 28 days after the claim's disallowance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A claimant whose claim has not been paid may petition the court for determination of the claim at any time before it is barred by the applicable statute of limitations and, upon due proof, may procure an order for the claim's allowance, payment, or security from the estate. If a proceeding is pending against a protected individual at the time of the appointment of a conservator or is initiated against the protected individual after the appointment, the moving party shall give notice of the proceeding to the conservator if the proceeding could result in creating a claim against the estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If it appears that the estate in conservatorship is likely to be exhausted before all existing claims are paid, the conservator shall distribute the estate in money or in kind in payment of claims in the following order:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Costs and expenses of administration.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Claims of the federal or state government having priority under law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Claims incurred by the conservator for care, maintenance, and education that were previously provided to the protected individual or the protected individual's dependents.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Claims arising before the conservatorship.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   All other claims.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A preference shall not be given in the payment of a claim over another claim of the same class, and a claim due and payable is not entitled to a preference over a claim not due. However, if it appears that the assets of the conservatorship are adequate to meet all existing claims, acting in the protected individual's best interest, the court may order the conservator to give a mortgage or other security on the conservatorship estate to secure payment at some future date of any or all claims listed in subsection (4)(e).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If a protected individual dies while under conservatorship, upon petition of the conservator and with or without notice, the court may hear a claim for burial expense or another claim as the court considers advisable. Upon hearing the claim, the court may enter an order allowing or disallowing the claim or a part of it and may provide in an order of allowance that the claim or a part of it shall be paid immediately if payment can be made without injury or serious inconvenience to the protected individual's estate.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The attorney-in-fact may be liable for any damage or loss to the principal, and may be subject to any other available remedy, for breach of fiduciary duty owed to the principal. In the durable power of attorney, the principal may exonerate the attorney-in-fact of any liability to the principal for breach of fiduciary duty except for actions committed by the attorney-in-fact in bad faith or with reckless indifference. An exoneration clause is not enforceable if inserted as the result of an abuse by the attorney-in-fact of a fiduciary or confidential relationship to the principal.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) I may be liable for any damage or loss to the principal, and may be subject to any other available remedy, for breach of fiduciary duty owed to the principal. In the durable power of attorney, the principal may exonerate me of any liability to the principal for breach of fiduciary duty except for actions committed by me in bad faith or with reckless indifference. An exoneration clause is not enforceable if inserted as the result of my abuse of a fiduciary or confidential relationship to the principal.</div>

A third party is not liable to the principal or any other person if the third party requires an attorney-in-fact named in a durable power of attorney to execute an acknowledgment that complies with subsection (4) before recognizing the durable power of attorney.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An attorney-in-fact's failure to comply with subsection (4) does not affect the attorney-in-fact's authority to act for the principal as provided for in the durable power of attorney and does not affect the attorney-in-fact's responsibilities or potential liability to the principal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Subsections (2) to (6) do not apply to any of the following:</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   An act done by an attorney in fact under a durable power of attorney during a period of disability or incapacity of the principal has the same effect and inures to the benefit of and binds the principal and the principal's successors in interest as if the principal were competent and not disabled.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If, following execution of a durable power of attorney, a court of the principal's domicile appoints a conservator, estate guardian, or other fiduciary charged with the management of all of the principal's property or all of his or her property except specified exclusions, the attorney in fact is accountable to the fiduciary as well as to the principal.

The statement regarding an anatomical gift under this subsection may include a statement of the patient's desires regarding the resolution of a conflict between the terms of the advance health care directive and the administration of means necessary to ensure the medical suitability of the anatomical gift. The patient may authorize the patient advocate to exercise 1 or more powers concerning the patient's care, custody, medical treatment, mental health treatment, the making of an anatomical gift, or the resolution of a conflict between the terms of the advance health care directive and the administration of means necessary to ensure the medical suitability of the anatomical gift that the patient could have exercised on the patient's own behalf.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A patient may designate in the patient advocate designation a successor individual as a patient advocate who may exercise the powers described in subsection (1) for the patient if the first individual named as patient advocate does not accept, is incapacitated, resigns, or is removed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Before a patient advocate designation is implemented, a copy of the patient advocate designation must be given to the proposed patient advocate and must be given to a successor patient advocate before the successor acts as patient advocate.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The acceptance of a designation as a patient advocate must include substantially all of the following statements:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>1. This patient advocate designation is not effective unless the patient is unable to participate in decisions regarding the patient's medical or mental health, as applicable. If this patient advocate designation includes the authority to make an anatomical gift as described in section 5506, the authority remains exercisable after the patient's death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>2. A patient advocate shall not exercise powers concerning the patient's care, custody, and medical or mental health treatment that the patient, if the patient were able to participate in the decision, could not have exercised on the patient's own behalf.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>3. This patient advocate designation cannot be used to make a medical treatment decision to withhold or withdraw treatment from a patient who is pregnant that would result in the pregnant patient's death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>4. A patient advocate may make a decision to withhold or withdraw treatment that would allow a patient to die only if the patient has expressed in a clear and convincing manner that the patient advocate is authorized to make such a decision, and that the patient acknowledges that such a decision could or would allow the patient's death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>5. A patient advocate shall not receive compensation for the performance of the patient advocate's authority, rights, and responsibilities, but a patient advocate may be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of the patient advocate's authority, rights, and responsibilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>6. A patient advocate shall act in accordance with the standards of care applicable to fiduciaries when acting for the patient and shall act consistent with the patient's best interests. The known desires of the patient expressed or evidenced while the patient is able to participate in medical or mental health treatment decisions are presumed to be in the patient's best interests.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>7. A patient may revoke the patient's patient advocate designation at any time and in any manner sufficient to communicate an intent to revoke.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>8. A patient may waive the patient's right to revoke the patient advocate designation as to the power to make mental health treatment decisions, and if the waiver is made, the patient's ability to revoke as to certain treatment will be delayed for 30 days after the patient communicates the patient's intent to revoke.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>9. A patient advocate may revoke the patient advocate's acceptance of the patient advocate designation at any time and in any manner sufficient to communicate an intent to revoke.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>10. A patient admitted to a health facility or agency has the rights enumerated in section 20201 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.20201.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A patient advocate shall act in accordance with the standards of care applicable to fiduciaries in exercising his or her powers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A patient advocate shall take reasonable steps to follow the desires, instructions, or guidelines given by the patient while the patient was able to participate in decisions regarding care, custody,  medical treatment,  or mental health treatment, as applicable, whether given orally or as written in the designation.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d)  The designation cannot be used to make a medical treatment decision to withhold or withdraw treatment from a patient who is pregnant that would result in the pregnant patient's death.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A patient advocate may make a decision to withhold or withdraw treatment that would allow a patient to die only if the patient has expressed in a clear and convincing manner that the patient advocate is authorized to make such a decision, and that the patient acknowledges that such a decision could or would allow the patient's death.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A patient advocate designation is revoked by 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The patient's death, except that part of the patient advocate designation, if any, that authorizes the patient advocate to make an anatomical gift of all or part of the deceased patient's body in accordance with this act and part 101 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.10101 to 333.10123.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The patient advocate's resignation or removal by the court, unless a successor patient advocate has been designated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The patient's revocation of the patient advocate designation. Subject to section 5515, even if the patient is unable to participate in medical treatment decisions, a patient may revoke a patient advocate designation at any time and in any manner by which he or she is able to communicate an intent to revoke the patient advocate designation. If there is a dispute as to the intent of the patient to revoke the patient advocate designation, the court may make a determination on the patient's intent to revoke the patient advocate designation. If the revocation is not in writing, an individual who witnesses a revocation of a patient advocate designation shall describe in writing the circumstances of the revocation, must sign the writing, and shall notify, if possible, the patient advocate of the revocation. If the patient's physician, mental health professional, or health facility has notice of the patient's revocation of a patient advocate designation, the physician, mental health professional, or health facility shall note the revocation in the patient's records and bedside chart and shall notify the patient advocate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A subsequent patient advocate designation that revokes the prior patient advocate designation either expressly or by inconsistency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The occurrence of a provision for revocation contained in the patient advocate designation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) If a patient advocate designation is executed during a patient's marriage naming the patient's spouse as the patient advocate, the patient advocate designation is suspended during the pendency of an action for separate maintenance, annulment, or divorce and is revoked upon the entry of a judgment of separate maintenance, annulment, or divorce, unless the patient has named a successor individual to serve as a patient advocate. If a successor patient advocate is named, that individual acts as the patient advocate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The revocation of a patient advocate designation under subsection (1) does not revoke or terminate the agency as to the patient advocate or other person who acts in good faith under the patient advocate designation and without actual knowledge of the revocation. Unless the action is otherwise invalid or unenforceable, an action taken without knowledge of the revocation binds the patient and his or her heirs, devisees, and personal representatives. A sworn statement executed by the patient advocate stating that, at the time of doing an act in accordance with the patient advocate designation, he or she did not have actual knowledge of the revocation of the patient advocate designation is, in the absence of fraud, conclusive proof that the patient advocate did not have actual knowledge of the revocation at the time of the act.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A registering entity is not required to offer or to accept a request for security registration in beneficiary form.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A registering entity is discharged from all claims to a security by a deceased owner's estate, creditors, heirs, or devisees if the entity registers a transfer of the security in accordance with section 6307 and does so in good-faith reliance on all of the following:</DIV>

<P>Sec. 6310.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A registering entity offering to accept registrations in beneficiary form may establish the terms and conditions under which it will receive requests for registrations in beneficiary form or for implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, including requests for cancellation of previously registered TOD beneficiary designations and requests for reregistration to effect a change of beneficiary. The terms and conditions so established may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving a problem concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries, and substituting a named beneficiary's descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary's death.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters LDPS, standing for "lineal descendants per stirpes". This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary's descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary's domicile at the owner's death governing inheritance by an intestate's descendants. Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on 1 or more contingencies, and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation or registrations in beneficiary form, may be contained in a registering entity's terms and conditions.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Action", with respect to a trustee, includes an act or a failure to act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Ascertainable standard" means a standard relating to an individual's health, education, support, or maintenance within the meaning of section 2041(b)(1)(A) or 2514(c)(1) of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 2041 and 2514.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Charitable trust" means a trust, or portion of a trust, created for a charitable purpose described in section 7405(1) if the charitable purpose is a material purpose of the trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Discretionary trust provision" means a provision in a trust, regardless of whether the terms of the trust provide a standard for the exercise of the trustee's discretion and regardless of whether the trust contains a spendthrift provision, that provides that the trustee has discretion, or words of similar import, to determine 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Whether to distribute to or for the benefit of an individual or a class of beneficiaries the income or principal or both of the trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The amount, if any, of the income or principal or both of the trust to distribute to or for the benefit of an individual or a class of beneficiaries.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Who, if any, among a class of beneficiaries will receive income or principal or both of the trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Whether the distribution of trust property is from income or principal or both of the trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) When to pay income or principal, except that a power to determine when to distribute income or principal within or with respect to a calendar or taxable year of the trust is not a discretionary trust provision if the distribution must be made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) "Interests of the trust beneficiaries" means the beneficial interests provided in the terms of the trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) "Power of withdrawal" means a presently exercisable general power of appointment other than a power that is either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Exercisable by a trustee and limited by an ascertainable standard.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Exercisable by another person only on consent of the trustee or a person holding an adverse interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) "Qualified trust beneficiary" means either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A trust beneficiary whom the settlor intends to benefit as a material purpose of the trust and to whom 1 or more of the following apply on the date the trust beneficiary's qualification is determined:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) The trust beneficiary is a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) The trust beneficiary would be a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the interests of the distributees under the trust described in sub-subparagraph (A) terminated on that date without causing the trust to terminate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(C) The trust beneficiary would be a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the trust terminated on that date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If on the date a trust beneficiary's qualification is determined there is no trust beneficiary described in subparagraph (i), a trust beneficiary to whom 1 or more of the following apply on the date the trust beneficiary's qualification is determined:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) The trust beneficiary is a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) The trust beneficiary would be a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the interests of the distributees under the trust described in sub-subparagraph (A) terminated on that date without causing the trust to terminate.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) "Revocable", as applied to a trust, means revocable by the settlor without the consent of the trustee or a person holding an adverse interest. A trust's characterization as revocable is not affected by the settlor's lack of capacity to exercise the power of revocation, regardless of whether an agent of the settlor under a durable power of attorney, a conservator of the settlor, or a plenary guardian of the settlor is serving.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) "Settlor" means a person, including a testator or a trustee, who creates a trust. If more than 1 person creates a trust, each person is a settlor of the portion of the trust property attributable to that person's contribution. The lapse, release, or waiver of a power of appointment does not cause the holder of a power of appointment to be treated as a settlor of the trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) "Spendthrift provision" means a term of a trust that restrains either the voluntary or involuntary transfer of a trust beneficiary's interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) "Support provision" means a provision in a trust that provides the trustee shall distribute income or principal or both for the health, education, support, or maintenance of a trust beneficiary, or language of similar import. A provision in a trust that provides a trustee has discretion whether to distribute income or principal or both for these purposes or to select from among a class of beneficiaries to receive distributions under the trust provision is not a support provision, but rather is a discretionary trust provision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) "Trust beneficiary" means a person to whom 1 or both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The person has a present or future beneficial interest in a trust, vested or contingent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The person holds a power of appointment over trust property in a capacity other than that of trustee or trust director.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) "Trust director" means that term as defined in section 7703a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) "Trust instrument" means a governing instrument that contains the terms of the trust, including any amendment to a term of the trust.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>700.7409a Trusts with nondisclosure period.</B><P>Sec. 7409a.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the terms of a trust other than a charitable trust are embodied in a trust instrument that clearly express the settlor's intent that 1 or more items of prime disclosure information should be withheld, generally or in specified circumstances, from 1 or more of the trust beneficiaries, both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) During the nondisclosure period all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) To the extent necessary to effectuate the settlor's expressed intent, the trustee does not have the duty under section 7814(2)(a) to (c) to provide beneficiaries with the terms of the trust and information about the trust's property and to notify qualified trust beneficiaries of the existence of the trust and the identity of the trustee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The trustee may administer the trust in accordance with the settlor's expressed intent regarding nondisclosure of primary disclosure information to the extent made practicable by the terms of the trust given the circumstances of the beneficiaries and any reporting obligations imposed on the trustee by law other than this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) If the trust instrument grants a nondisclosure correlative right, the trustee has a duty to administer the trust in accordance with the settlor's expressed intent regarding nondisclosure of primary disclosure information, but only to the extent made practicable by the terms of the trust given the circumstances of the beneficiaries and any reporting obligations imposed on the trustee by law other than this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Any purported appointment or distribution of assets of the instant trust to another undisclosed trust is ineffective to the extent it could cause the appointed or distributed assets to be administered continuously under the authority of this section for a period ending after the date on which the instant trust's maximum nondisclosure period ends.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The trustee or any holder of either a nondisclosure correlative right or a protection power is not liable to any trust beneficiary because of the trustee's failure to follow the terms of the trust prescribing nondisclosure of prime disclosure information. The trustee's duty, if any, to follow the terms of the trust prescribing nondisclosure of prime disclosure information during the trust's nondisclosure period is owed solely to the holders, if any, of nondisclosure correlative rights, and the sole remedy of a nondisclosure correlative right holder for the trustee's breach of that duty is removal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the trust instrument grants either a nondisclosure correlative right or a protection power, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) On the reasonable request of a nondisclosure correlative right holder or protection power holder at any time during the trust's nondisclosure period, the trustee shall promptly furnish to the right or power holder a copy of the terms of the trust that describe or affect the holder's right or power.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Upon the failure or insufficiency of money or property out of which payment should be made, to the extent of the insufficiency, a distribution of property from the trust that is to be satisfied out of specified or identified property shall be classed as a distribution to be satisfied out of the general trust property not otherwise disposed of in the terms of the trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A distribution of property from the trust given for valuable consideration abates with other distributions of the same class only to the extent of the excess over the amount of the value of the consideration until all others of the same class are exhausted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Except as otherwise provided in this section, distributions of property from the trust abate equally and ratably and without preference or priority as between real and personal property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If a specified or identified item of property that has been designated for distribution in the terms of the trust or that is charged with a distribution is sold or taken by the trustee, other beneficiaries shall contribute according to their respective interests to the trust beneficiary whose property is sold or taken, and, before distribution, the trustee shall determine the amounts of the respective contributions, which shall be paid or withheld before distribution is made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Costs and expenses of trust administration, including trustee compensation and attorney fees, shall be paid by the trustee before and in preference to the administration costs and expenses of the settlor's estate, an enforceable and timely filed claim of a creditor of the settlor, and homestead, family, and exempt property allowances. If, after paying costs and expenses of trust administration, the trust property is insufficient to pay in full all charges for which the trust is liable under section 7605(1), the trustee shall make payment in the following order of priority:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Costs and expenses of administration of the decedent's estate.</div>

Each trustee is entitled to right of contribution as necessary to effect the pro rata liability. The allocation and contribution, however, are subject to provisions in the trusts regarding the allocation and burden of the charges.

The trustee shall not change a decision disallowing a claim if the time for the claimant to commence a proceeding for allowance expires or if the time to commence a proceeding on the claim expires and the claim has been barred. A claim that is disallowed in whole or in part by the trustee is barred to the extent not allowed unless the claimant commences a proceeding against the trustee not later than 63 days after the mailing of the notice of disallowance or partial allowance if the notice warns the claimant of the impending bar. Failure by the trustee to deliver or mail to a claimant notice of action on the claim within 63 days after the time for the claim's presentation has expired constitutes a notice of allowance.</div>

The trustee shall notify the claimant of the change to disallowance, and the disallowed claim is then subject to bar as provided in subdivision (a).

However, except as provided in subsection (2) and notwithstanding the breadth of discretion granted to a trustee in the terms of the trust, including the use of such terms as "absolute", "sole", or "uncontrolled", a trustee abuses the trustee's discretion in exercising or failing to exercise a discretionary power if the trustee does any of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A trustee may not exercise a power to make distributions pursuant to a discretionary trust provision in a manner to satisfy a legal obligation of support that the trustee personally owes another person.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A power whose exercise is limited or prohibited by subsection (3) may be exercised by a majority of the remaining trustees whose exercise of the power is not so limited or prohibited.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Subsection (3) does not apply to any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A power held by the settlor's spouse who is the trustee of a trust for which a marital deduction, as defined in section 2056(b)(5) or 2523(e) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 2056 and 2523, was previously allowed.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If an irrevocable trust includes a discretionary trust provision, the trustee of the trust may, unless the terms of the first trust expressly provide otherwise, distribute by written instrument all or part of the property subject to that provision to the trustee of a second trust, if both of the following conditions are satisfied:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The terms of the second trust do not materially change the beneficial interests of the beneficiaries of the first trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the governing instrument of the first trust expressly indicates an intention that the first trust qualify for a tax benefit or the terms of the first trust are clearly designed to qualify the first trust for a tax benefit, and if the first trust would qualify for the intended tax benefit, the governing instrument of the second trust is not inconsistent with the tax planning that informed the first trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A distribution of property to the trustee of a second trust under subsection (1) must not result in any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An increase in or a change in the method of determining the compensation of a trustee, unless the increase or change has been consented to in writing by all beneficiaries entitled to receive reports regarding the first trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A charge of a fee or commission on the transfer of assets from the first trust to the second trust, unless the fee or commission has been consented to in writing by all beneficiaries entitled to receive reports regarding the first trust.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A diminution in the authority of a person that has a power exercisable in a fiduciary capacity to direct or remove the trustee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For purposes of this section, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) In determining whether a trust is irrevocable, a settlor's lack of capacity to exercise a power of revocation negates the power unless an agent of the settlor under a durable power of attorney, a conservator of the settlor, or a plenary guardian of the settlor is serving and the agent, conservator, or guardian is authorized to exercise the power of revocation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If an increase in the maximum period during which the vesting of a future interest may be postponed is due solely to a change of applicable law governing remoteness of vesting, the increase does not constitute a material change in the interest of a beneficiary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An increase in compensation arising solely because a change of applicable law governing remoteness of vesting makes the duration of the second trust longer than the duration of the first trust does not constitute an increase in or a change in the method of determining the compensation of the trustee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The distribution power described in subsection (1) must not be exercised over any portion of the first trust as to which the exercising trustee is the settlor, unless the exercising trustee was acting in a fiduciary capacity when the trustee created the first trust. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The trustee of the second trust may be the trustee of the first trust, the second trust may be a trust under the governing instrument of the first trust or another governing instrument, the governing instrument may be created by the trustee of the first trust, and the governing instrument may be the instrument that exercises the power described in subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The second trust instrument may provide 1 or both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That assets of the first trust discovered after exercise of the power described in subsection (1) will be property of the first trust if that trust is to continue in existence after exercise of the power, or that assets of the first trust discovered after exercise of the power will be property of the second trust if the first trust terminates on exercise of the power.</div>
