<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a licensee anticipates acquiring and holding control of a business firm under subsection (1)(a), the licensee shall file with the commissioner a plan for acquiring and holding control of the business firm that shall include at least all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The reasons it is necessary for the licensee to acquire and hold control of the business firm.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The percentage of outstanding voting stock or voting membership interests of the business firm the licensee plans to own.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The licensee's proposed course of action upon obtaining control of the business firm.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 509.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A licensee shall transact its business in a safe and sound manner and shall maintain itself in a safe and sound condition.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In determining whether a licensee is transacting business in a safe and sound manner or has committed an unsafe or unsound act, the commissioner shall not consider the risk of a provision of financing assistance to a business firm, unless the commissioner determines that the risk is so great compared with the realistically expected return as to demonstrate gross mismanagement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Subsection (2) does not limit the authority of the commissioner to do any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Determine that a licensee's financing assistance to a single business firm or a group of affiliated business firms is in violation of subsection (1) or constitutes an unsafe or unsound act, if the amount of that financing assistance is unduly large in relation to the total assets or the total owners equity of the licensee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Require that a licensee maintain a reserve in the amount of anticipated losses.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Require that a licensee have in effect a written financing assistance policy, approved by its board of directors, including credit evaluation and other matters. The commissioner shall not require that a licensee adopt a financing assistance policy that contains standards that prevent the licensee from exercising needed flexibility in evaluating and structuring financing assistance to business firms on a deal by deal basis.</DIV>

Each person who participates in the decision of the licensee relating to a transaction described in this section and has knowledge of a potential conflict of interest involving that transaction shall take care that the potential conflict of interest is disclosed in the financing documents of the transaction or, for a business transaction not involving financing assistance, in another appropriate document. </DIV>

The commissioner may administer oaths and affirmations to any person whose testimony is required.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   A notice served under this section shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged practice or violation, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist should be issued against the licensee.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A financial institution shall develop and implement a policy for training relevant employees to recognize signs of covered financial exploitation of members or customers of the financial institution, and for reporting that activity to a law enforcement agency or adult protective services. A policy described in this subsection must, at a minimum, include training on and procedures for reporting covered financial exploitation of vulnerable adults, but may include any other categories of potentially affected members or customers or apply generally to all members or customers of the financial institution and must provide for all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Employee training, including, but not limited to, instruction on all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Common types of covered financial exploitation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Signs of potential covered financial exploitation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Relevant federal advisory opinions or guidance on elder financial exploitation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Internal procedures developed under subdivisions (b) to (d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Reporting procedures under subdivision (f).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Procedures to follow when covered financial exploitation of a member or customer is suspected or detected based on available facts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Procedures to follow when, after examination or investigation of available facts, covered financial exploitation of a member or customer is no longer suspected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Procedures to follow for delaying or placing a freeze on transactions or assets relative to a member's or customer's accounts, individually or jointly held, if covered financial exploitation is suspected or detected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Designation of 1 or more employees to make a report described in subdivision (f).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Except as provided in subsection (2) or as prohibited under federal law, reporting of suspected or detected covered financial exploitation of a member or customer to which the policy created under this act applies to a law enforcement agency or adult protective services. If a financial institution elects to report to adult protective services instead of law enforcement, a report made to adult protective services must be made according to procedures established by adult protective services under applicable law. In determining whether and to what entity to make a report, the policy must, at a minimum, require:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Consideration of relevant federal advisory opinions or guidance on elder financial exploitation and applicable employee training.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Consideration of the safety of employees, the customer or member that the financial institution believes is the target of covered financial exploitation, or other customers or members.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Consideration of the need and ability to preserve funds or assets of the customer or member that the financial institution believes is the target of covered financial exploitation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Consideration of whether the financial institution can discern, from available facts and knowledge of the member or customer that is the potential victim of covered financial exploitation, that that member or customer is an adult in need of protective services, as that term is defined in section 11(b) of the social welfare act, 1939 PA 280, MCL 400.11.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) A citation to this act, indicating the policy was drafted to comply with this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A financial institution is not required to make a report of suspected or detected covered financial exploitation under any policy adopted under subsection (1) if, after investigation or examination of available facts, the financial institution makes a determination that covered financial exploitation has not occurred or is not occurring and no action is necessary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A report of suspected or detected covered financial exploitation made by a financial institution, or by any other person under section 11(3), must include the name of the individual believed to be the victim, a description of the suspected or detected covered financial exploitation, and a designated contact for notices required under subsection (4) if the reporter is a financial institution. If a report under this subsection is made by telephone, the law enforcement agency or adult protective services that receives the report must make a written record of the information provided in the telephonic report.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Within 10 business days after it receives a report of suspected or detected covered financial exploitation from a financial institution under this section, the law enforcement agency or adult protective services that received the report must provide written notification to the designated contact of the financial institution that clearly indicates whether a reported incident is under investigation or has been referred to a law enforcement agency for investigation. As soon as practicable after the investigation, the law enforcement agency or adult protective services shall notify the financial institution of the disposition of the reported incident.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Within 10 business days after it receives a report of suspected or detected covered financial exploitation from a financial institution under this section, a law enforcement agency or adult protective services must notify the office of the county prosecutor. Notification must be made in a manner prescribed by the attorney general and must include, at a minimum, a copy of each report submitted to or committed to written form by the law enforcement agency or adult protective services and the response to, or actions taken based on, the report by the law enforcement agency or adult protective services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a financial institution that attempts to make a report of suspected or detected covered financial exploitation under this section is unable to communicate with a law enforcement agency or adult protective services to make the report, or if the law enforcement agency or adult protective services that receives a report under this act fails to provide notification to the financial institution under subsection (4), the financial institution may notify the office of the county prosecutor. Notification under this subsection must be made in a manner prescribed by the attorney general.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A law enforcement agency, adult protective services, or county prosecutor must not disclose the identity of an individual or financial institution that makes a report of suspected or detected covered financial exploitation without the consent of the individual or financial institution. However, this subsection does not prohibit a disclosure that is made by adult protective services to a law enforcement agency or by a law enforcement agency or adult protective services to the county prosecutor as required under subsection (5), or a disclosure required in a civil or criminal proceeding. A law enforcement agency, adult protective services, or county prosecutor shall not disclose the identity, or personal or account information, of an individual that is the subject of a report of suspected or detected covered financial exploitation as a victim without that individual's consent, except as required under subsection (5) or as required in a civil or criminal proceeding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The identity of an individual or financial institution that makes a report of suspected or detected covered financial exploitation under this section is exempt from disclosure under section 13(1)(b)(iv) or (d) of the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.243. The identity of an individual that is the suspected or confirmed victim of covered financial exploitation or his or her personal or account information is exempt from disclosure under section 13(1)(a), (b)(iii), or (d) of the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.243. This subsection does not limit the applicability of any other exceptions to disclosure under section 13 of the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.243, to all or any part of a report made under this act.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, and subject to subsection (3), if a financial institution suspects or detects covered financial exploitation of a member or customer, the financial institution may delay the related transaction for further investigation or examination of available facts. Upon investigation or examination of available facts, if the financial institution still suspects or has detected covered financial exploitation of the member or customer, the financial institution may either continue the delay of related transactions under this subsection or place a freeze on any transactions or assets related to that member's or customer's accounts, individually or jointly held, as provided in this subsection. Any delay or freeze placed by the financial institution must be done according to the terms of any account or service agreement between the financial institution and the member or customer. If there is not an applicable account or service agreement between the financial institution and the member or customer, the financial institution may delay an individual transaction or place a freeze on any transactions or assets relative to that member's or customer's accounts, individually or jointly held, under this section for up to 10 business days, or according to the terms of any applicable court order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a financial institution is informed by a law enforcement agency or adult protective services under section 5(4) that suspected or detected covered financial exploitation that has been reported is under investigation, the financial institution may extend the term of a transaction delay or freeze until the financial institution is informed of the dismissal of the reported incident or the financial institution reasonably believes there is no continued risk of covered financial exploitation of the targeted individual, whichever is later.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A financial institution may provide for the processing of any transaction necessary to preserve the health, safety, or financial well-being of a member or customer during the period of a transaction delay or freeze, unless those transactions are related to the suspected covered financial exploitation or the financial institution is directed otherwise by court order.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) On or before December 31, 2006, the commissioner shall develop, implement, and maintain a statewide, common database that has real-time access through an internet connection, is accessible at all time to licensees, and to the commissioner for purposes of subsections (10) and (11), and meets the requirements of this section. Before the commissioner determines that the database is fully operational for the purposes of this act, for at least 30 days the database provider shall operate a pilot program of the database to test all of the processes of the database. The database provider shall make the pilot program available to all applicants and licensees. During the 30-day period that begins on the date the commissioner determines that the database is fully operational, the commissioner shall not approve the imposition of any database verification fees under section 34(5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The commissioner may operate the database described in subsection (1) or may select and contract with a single third party provider to operate the database. If the commissioner contracts with a third party provider for the operation of the database, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The commissioner shall ensure that the third party provider selected as the database provider operates the database pursuant to the provisions of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The commissioner shall consider cost of service and ability to meet all the requirements of this section in selecting a third party provider as the database provider.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) In selecting a third party provider to act as the database provider, the commissioner shall give strong consideration to the third party provider's ability to prevent fraud, abuse, and other unlawful activity associated with deferred presentment service transactions and provide additional tools for the administration and enforcement of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The third party provider shall only use the data collected under this act as prescribed in this act and the contract with the office and for no other purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the third party provider violates this section, the commissioner shall terminate the contract and the third party provider is barred from becoming a party to any other state contracts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A person injured by the third party provider's violation of this act may maintain a civil cause of action against the third party provider and may recover actual damages plus reasonable attorney fees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The database described in subsection (1) shall allow a licensee accessing the database to do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Verify whether a customer has any open deferred presentment service transactions with any licensee that have not been closed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Provide information necessary to ensure licensee compliance with any requirements imposed by the federal office of foreign asset control under federal law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Track and monitor the number of customers who notify a licensee of violations of this act, the number of times a licensee agreed that a violation occurred, the number of times that a licensee did not agree that a violation occurred, the amount of restitution paid, and any other information the commissioner requires by rule.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Determine whether a customer is eligible for repayment of the deferred presentment service transaction in installments as provided in section 35(2) and notify the licensee of that eligibility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) While operating the database, the database provider shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Establish and maintain a process for responding to transaction verification requests due to technical difficulties occurring with the database that prevent the licensee from accessing the database through the internet.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Comply with any applicable provisions of the social security number privacy act, 2004 PA 454, MCL 445.81 to 445.87.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Comply with any applicable provisions of the identity theft protection act, 2004 PA 452, MCL 445.61 to 445.77.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Provide accurate and secure receipt, transmission, and storage of customer data.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Meet the requirements of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) When the database provider receives notification that a deferred presentment service transaction is closed under section 34, the database provider shall designate the transaction as closed in the database immediately, but in no event after 11:59 p.m. on the day the commissioner or database provider receives notification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The database provider shall automatically designate a deferred presentment service transaction as closed in the database 5 days after the transaction maturity date unless a licensee reports to the database provider before that time that the transaction remains open because of the customer's failure to make payment; that the transaction is open because the customer's check or an electronic redeposit is in the process of clearing the banking system; or that the transaction remains open because the customer's check is being returned to the licensee for insufficient funds, a closed account, or a stop payment order, or any other factors determined by the commissioner. If a licensee reports the status of a transaction as open in a timely manner, the transaction remains an open transaction until it is closed under section 34 and the database provider is notified that the transaction is closed under that section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a licensee stops providing deferred presentment service transactions, the database provider shall designate all open transactions with that licensee as closed in the database 60 days after the date the licensee stops offering deferred presentment service transactions, unless the licensee reports to the database provider before the expiration of the 60-day period which of its transactions remain open and the specific reason each transaction remains open. The licensee shall also provide to the commissioner a reasonably acceptable plan that outlines how the licensee will continue to update the database after it stops offering deferred presentment service transactions. The commissioner shall promptly approve or disapprove the plan and immediately notify the licensee of his or her decision. If the plan is disapproved, the licensee may submit a new plan or may submit a modified plan for the licensee to follow. If at any time the commissioner reasonably determines that a licensee that has stopped offering deferred presentment service transactions is not updating the database in accordance with its approved plan, the commissioner shall immediately close or instruct the database provider to immediately close all remaining open transactions of that licensee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The response to an inquiry to the database provider by a licensee shall only state that a person is eligible or ineligible for a new deferred presentment service transaction and describe the reason for that determination. Only the person seeking the transaction may make a direct inquiry to the database provider to request a more detailed explanation of a particular transaction that was the basis for the ineligibility determination. Any information regarding any person's transactional history is confidential, is not subject to public inspection, is not a public record subject to the disclosure requirements of the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246, is not subject to discovery, subpoena, or other compulsory process except in an action under section 53, and shall not be disclosed to any person other than the commissioner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The database provider may charge licensees a verification fee for access to the database, in amounts approved by the commissioner under section 34(5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The commissioner may access the database provided under subsection (1) only for purposes of an investigation of, examination of, or enforcement action concerning an individual database provider, licensee, customer, or other person. The commissioner and any employees of the commissioner, the office, or this state shall not obtain or access a customer's social security number, driver license number, or other state-issued identification number in the database except as provided in this subsection. An individual who violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $1,000.00, or both, and if convicted, an individual who violates this subsection shall be dismissed from office or discharged from employment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The commissioner shall investigate violations of and enforce this section. The commissioner shall not delegate its responsibilities under this subsection to any third party provider.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The commissioner shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Require by rule that data are retained in the database only as required to ensure licensee compliance with this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Require by rule that data in the database concerning a customer transaction are archived within 365 days after the customer transaction is closed unless needed for a pending enforcement action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Require by rule that any identifying customer information is deleted from the database when data are archived.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Require by rule that data in the database concerning a customer transaction are deleted from the database 3 years after the customer transaction is closed or any enforcement action pending 3 years after the customer transaction is closed is completed, whichever is later.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The commissioner may maintain access to data archived under subsection (12) for future legislative or policy review.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A licensee shall verify a customer's eligibility to enter into a deferred presentment service transaction by doing 1 of the following, as applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the commissioner has not implemented a database under section 22 or the database described in section 22 is not fully operational, as determined by the commissioner, verifying that the customer does not have an open deferred presentment service transaction with the licensee. The licensee shall maintain a database of all of the licensee's transactions at all of its locations and search that database to meet its obligation under this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the commissioner has implemented a database under section 22 and the database described in that section is fully operational, as determined by the commissioner, accessing the database and verifying that the customer does not have an outstanding deferred presentment service transaction with the licensee and does not have more than 1 open deferred presentment service transaction that has not been fully repaid with any other licensee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the commissioner has not implemented a database under section 22; the database described in that section is not fully operational, as determined by the commissioner; or the licensee is unable to access the database and the alternative mechanism for verification described in subsection (3) is also unavailable, as determined by the commissioner, a licensee may rely upon the written verification of the borrower in a statement provided in substantially the following form in at least 12-point type:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>"I DO NOT HAVE ANY OUTSTANDING DEFERRED PRESENTMENT SERVICE TRANSACTIONS WITH THIS LICENSEE AND I DO NOT HAVE MORE THAN ONE OUTSTANDING DEFERRED PRESENTMENT SERVICE TRANSACTION WITH ANY OTHER LICENSED DEFERRED PRESENTMENT SERVICE PROVIDER IN THIS STATE.".</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a licensee is unable to access the database described in section 22 due to technical difficulties occurring with the database, as determined by the commissioner, the licensee shall utilize the process established in section 22(4) to verify transactions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The commissioner may use the database to administer and enforce this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If approved by the commissioner, the database provider may impose a database verification fee for the actual costs of entering, accessing, and verifying data in the database described in section 22 to verify that a customer does not have any other open deferred presentment service transactions with the licensee and does not have more than 1 open deferred presentment service transaction with any other licensees. A database verification fee is payable to the database provider in a manner prescribed by the commissioner. A licensee may charge a customer all or part of the database verification fee under section 33(1)(b) but may not charge a customer any other fee except as authorized in section 33(1) or 35(2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A licensee may rely on the information contained in the database described in section 22 as accurate and is not subject to any administrative penalty or civil liability as a result of relying on inaccurate information contained in the database.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Before entering into a deferred presentment service transaction, a licensee shall submit to the database provider the customer's name and address, the customer's social security number, driver license number, or other state-issued identification number, the amount of the transaction, the customer's check number, the date of the transaction, the maturity date of the transaction, and any other information reasonably required by the commissioner or the database provider, in a format reasonably required by the commissioner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) When a deferred presentment service transaction is closed, the licensee shall designate the transaction as closed and immediately notify the database provider, but in no event after 11:59 p.m. on the day the transaction is closed. The commissioner shall assess an administrative fine of $100.00 for each day that the licensee fails to notify the database provider that the transaction has been closed. It is a defense to the assessment of an administrative fine that notifying the database provider was not possible due to temporary technical problems with the database or to circumstances beyond the licensee's control.</div>

Beginning March 1, 2011, and by March 1 of every fifth year after March 1, 2011, the licensee may adjust the fee by an amount determined by the director to reflect the cumulative percentage change in the Detroit consumer price index over the preceding 5 calendar years.

If a customer has entered into 8 deferred presentment service transactions in any 12-month period, the database provider shall notify the licensee when the licensee submits the required customer information to the database for that customer that the customer is entitled to a repayment plan under this section. The database provider shall instruct the licensee to provide the customer with the following notice, in a document separate from the deferred presentment transaction agreement and in at least 12-point type:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>"If you are unable to pay your deferred presentment service transaction and have entered into 8 deferred presentment transactions in any 12-month period, state law entitles you to request a repayment of that transaction in installments. We are required to advise you of this option at the time it is available. If you elect this option, you must notify us, either orally or in writing, within 30 days after the maturity date of the eighth deferred presentment transaction in the 12-month period. The notice must be provided to us at our place of business. You may be charged an additional fee when the transaction is rescheduled in installments. You will be ineligible to enter into a deferred presentment service transaction with any licensee during the term of the repayment plan. If we refuse to provide this option under the stipulations above, you should contact the department of insurance and financial services toll-free at 1-877-999-6442.".</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) During the term of a repayment plan by a drawer under this section, the database provider shall notify the licensee at the time the licensee submits the required customer information to the database for that customer that the customer is presently in a repayment plan under this section with 1 or more other licensees and the licensee shall not enter into a deferred presentment transaction with that individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A licensee shall not present a check for payment before the maturity date or during the term of the repayment plan. In addition to the remedies and penalties under this act, a licensee that presents a check for payment before the maturity date or during the term of the repayment plan is liable for all expenses and damages caused to the drawer and the drawee as a result of the violation. If a drawer has not requested a repayment plan on or before the maturity date, the licensee may redeem, present for payment, or enter the check into the check-clearing process under the terms of the original deferred presentment service transaction agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A drawer satisfies his or her obligation under a deferred presentment service agreement when the check the licensee is holding is paid by the drawee or is redeemed by the drawer by paying to the licensee an amount equal to the full amount of the check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Unless the drawer has entered into a written repayment plan under subsection (2), a licensee shall deposit a check held in connection with a deferred presentment service transaction on the maturity date if the check is not redeemed in the manner described in section 2(1)(c)(i), or exchanged in the manner described in section 2(1)(c)(ii), on or before the maturity date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A licensee shall deposit a check held in connection with a deferred presentment service transaction on any repayment plan installment date described in subsection (2) if the drawer fails to make the installment payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the drawer has an outstanding deferred presentment service transaction in which a check held in connection with the transaction was deposited and returned unpaid, the licensee may collect the check by means of 1 or more telephone-initiated entries if all of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The drawer agrees to each telephone-initiated entry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Each telephone-initiated entry is a single, date-specific payment and does not authorize more than 1 payment or periodic payments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The licensee does not charge the drawer a fee in connection with the telephone-initiated entry or entries.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If the payment to satisfy an outstanding deferred presentment transaction obligation is made in person, the licensee shall immediately return the check held in connection with the deferred presentment service transaction to the drawer. If the payment to satisfy the obligation is not made in person, the licensee shall return the check to the drawer by mailing it to the address listed on the deferred presentment transaction service agreement within 1 business day after the licensee obtains evidence that the drawer has satisfied the obligation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A licensee shall only accept a payment by debit card to redeem a check the licensee is holding if the drawer certifies to the licensee that the debit card draws funds from the same account on which the check is drawn.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) As used in this section, "telephone-initiated entry" means a debit transaction to a drawer's account that is processed through an automated clearing house, as that term is defined in section 1 of 2002 PA 738, MCL 124.301, and initiated pursuant to an authorization obtained from the drawer orally by telephone.</div>

<P>Sec. 215.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If in the opinion of the commissioner a savings bank is engaging, has engaged, or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of the savings bank or is violating, has violated, or is about to violate a law or rule, the commissioner may issue and serve upon the savings bank a notice of charges in respect to the practice or violation. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged unsafe or unsound practice or violation, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist should issue against the savings bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The hearing shall be not earlier than 30 days or later than 60 days after service of the notice unless another date is set by the commissioner at the request of the savings bank. Unless the savings bank appears at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease and desist order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In the event of a consent, or if upon the record made at the hearing, the commissioner finds that an unsafe or unsound practice or violation specified in the notice of charges has been established, the commissioner may issue and serve upon the savings bank an order to cease and desist from the practice or violation. The order may require the savings bank and its directors, officers, employees, and agents to cease and desist from the practice or violation and to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from the practice or violation.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the commissioner determines that an out-of-state bank branch located in this state is acting in violation of the laws of this state or that the activities of the branch are being conducted in an unsafe and unsound manner, the commissioner may undertake enforcement actions and proceedings as would be permitted if the branch were a savings bank.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the commissioner determines that the violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges served upon the savings bank under section 215 is likely to cause insolvency or substantial dissipation of assets or earnings of the savings bank, or is likely to otherwise seriously prejudice the interests of its depositors, the commissioner may issue a temporary order requiring the savings bank to cease and desist from the violation or practice. The order shall become effective upon service upon the savings bank, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized by subsection (2), and shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the administrative proceedings under the notice and until such time as the commissioner shall dismiss the charges specified in the notice or if a cease and desist order is issued against the savings bank, until the effective date of such order.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If in the opinion of the commissioner a director or officer of a savings bank has committed a violation of law or rule or of a cease and desist order that has become final, or has engaged or participated in an unsafe or unsound practice in connection with the savings bank, or has committed or engaged in an act, omission, or practice that constitutes a breach of his or her fiduciary duty as a director or officer and the commissioner determines that the savings bank has suffered or will probably suffer substantial financial loss or other damage or that the interest of its depositors could be seriously prejudiced by reason of the violation, practice, or breach of fiduciary duty, the commissioner may serve upon the director or officer a written notice of his or her intention to remove him or her from office.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If in the opinion of the commissioner a director or officer of a savings bank, by conduct or practice with respect to another savings bank or other business organization which resulted in substantial financial loss or other damage, has evidenced his or her personal unfitness to continue as a director or officer and if in the opinion of the commissioner, any other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of any savings bank, by conduct or practice with respect to such savings bank or other business organization which resulted in substantial financial loss or other damage, has evidenced his or her personal unfitness to participate in the conduct of the affairs of the savings bank, the commissioner may serve upon the director, officer, or other person a written notice of his or her intention to remove him or her from office or to prohibit his or her further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the savings bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In addition to a notice sent under subsection (1) or (2), if the commissioner deems it necessary for the protection of the savings bank or the interests of its depositors that the director, officer, or other person be immediately suspended from office or prohibited from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the savings bank, the commissioner may serve upon the director, officer, or other person a written notice suspending him or her from office or prohibiting him or her from further participation in any manner in the conduct of affairs of the savings bank. The suspension or prohibition shall become effective upon service of the notice and, unless stayed by a court in proceedings authorized by section 218, shall remain in effect pending the completion of the administrative proceedings under the notice served under subsection (1) or (2) and until such time as the commissioner may dismiss the charges specified in the notice or, if an order of removal or prohibition is issued against the director, officer, or other person, until the effective date of the order. Copies of the notice shall also be served upon the savings bank of the director or officer or in the conduct of whose affairs he or she has participated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A notice of intention to remove a director, officer, or other person from office or to prohibit his or her participation in the conduct of the affairs of any savings bank shall contain a statement of the facts constituting grounds for the notice, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held. The hearing shall be held not earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after the date of service of the notice, unless another date is set by the commissioner at the request of the director, officer, or other person and for good cause shown.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Unless the director, officer, or other person appears at the hearing in person or by a duly authorized representative, he or she shall be considered to have consented to the issuance of an order of removal or prohibition. In the event of consent, or if upon the record made at the hearing the commissioner finds that any of the grounds specified in the notice have been established, the commissioner may issue an order of suspension or removal from office, or prohibition from participation in the conduct of the affairs of the savings bank. The order shall become effective at the expiration of 30 days after service upon the savings bank and the director, officer, or other person, except in the case of an order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified in the order. The order shall remain effective and enforceable unless it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the commissioner or a reviewing court.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as provided in subsection (2), the shares of a savings bank shall be represented by certificates of stock that shall be issued to every shareholder and transferable on the books of the savings bank in a manner as may be prescribed in the bylaws or articles of incorporation. A transfer of stock shall not be valid against the savings bank, except with the consent of the board of directors, so long as the registered holder of the stock is liable as principal debtor, surety, or otherwise to the savings bank for any debt which is due and unpaid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, the board may authorize the issuance of some or all of the shares of any or all of its classes or series of stock without certificates if within a reasonable time after issuance of a share without a certificate the savings bank provides the shareholder with a written statement of the information required on a certificate under subsection (5). The authorization shall not have any effect on shares already represented by certificates unless they are surrendered to the savings bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the registered holder of stock of a savings bank is liable to the savings bank as principal debtor, surety or otherwise for any debt which is due and unpaid, the directors of the savings bank may sell a sufficient amount of the stock of the delinquent shareholder in the same manner and with the same effect as provided in section 501. This section does not prevent the savings bank from bringing proceedings to recover the entire amount of the indebtedness at any time before the sale or to recover the balance of the debt and costs after the proceeds of sale have been applied against the debt and costs or to recover the balance of the debt after the cancellation of the stock.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Except as provided in section 501, the rights of a savings bank in its stock in which the shareholder is liable to the bank as principal debtor, surety, or otherwise is subject to any pledge, sale, or other transfer of the stock that is made before the maturity of an indebtedness of the registered holder of the stock to the savings bank and of which the savings bank has knowledge before the maturity, whether or not the stock was transferred on the books of the savings bank. Any stock of a savings bank that is pledged, sold, or otherwise transferred before the maturity of any indebtedness of the registered holder of the stock to the savings bank and of which pledge, sale, or other transfer the savings bank has knowledge before the maturity, may be transferred on the books of the savings bank after the maturity without the consent of the board of directors of the savings bank.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Each certificate issued after the effective date of the amendatory act that added subsection (8) shall state all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The name and address of the principal office of the savings bank.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   If the stock is not listed, that no transfer of the stock shall be valid against the savings bank so long as the registered holder is liable as principal debtor, surety, or otherwise to the savings bank, except with the approval of the board of directors or as otherwise provided in this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The signature of the president or other officer as provided by the bylaws of the savings bank and, optionally, the seal of the savings bank.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An increase in capital shall not be valid until the whole amount of the increase has been paid in, notice of the payment signed by an officer of the savings bank has been transmitted to the commissioner, and the commissioner's certificate of approval has been obtained specifying the amount of the increase in capital and that it has been duly paid in as a part of the capital of the savings bank. The certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the stock has been duly and validly issued.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In the case of the issuance of new stock, in voting upon the increase of capital stock, 2/3 of the shareholders entitled to vote shall have power to fix the value of, and the price at which the stock shall be subscribed and paid for by the shareholders, but not less than par, as well as the time and manner of the subscription and payment, and to authorize the directors to sell the stock.</DIV>

The reduction may be accomplished by a reduction in the par value of the existing stock or by a reduction in the number of the shares of the stock. A reduction shall not be made until the amount of the proposed reduction has been reported to and approved by the commissioner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The approval of the commissioner shall be based upon a finding by him or her that the security of existing creditors of the savings bank will not be impaired by the proposed reduction. This section does not discharge a savings bank that has decreased its capital stock from an obligation or demand that is due from the savings bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Retirement of preferred stock under the articles of incorporation is not considered to be a reduction of capital under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A shareholder is not entitled to a distribution of cash or other assets by reason of a reduction of the capital of a savings bank unless the distribution has been approved by the commissioner and by the affirmative vote of at least 2/3 of the shares of each class of stock outstanding, voting as classes.</DIV>

For the purpose of this section, an amount transferred to a fund for the retirement of preferred stock of the savings bank out of its net income for the periods is considered to be additions to its surplus, if upon the retirement of the preferred stock the amounts credited into the retirement fund may then properly be carried to surplus. The savings bank is obligated to credit to surplus the amounts transferred into the retirement fund on account of the preferred stock as the stock is retired.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Notwithstanding the limitations of this section, a savings bank with the approval of the commissioner and by vote of shareholders owning 2/3 of the stock entitled to vote may increase its capital stock by declaration of a stock dividend on the capital stock. After the increase the surplus of the bank shall be at least equal to 20% of the capital stock as increased.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A savings bank may pay dividends on its preferred stock at a rate as may be applicable without regard to the limitations of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A holding company that owns common or preferred stock of a savings bank may waive its right to receive dividends and any payment in lieu of dividends.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Dividends paid to shareholders under a dividend reinvestment plan shall be subject to this act regarding the payment of dividends.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 325.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A director or an officer of a savings bank shall discharge the duties of his or her position in good faith and with that degree of diligence, care, and skill that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances in a like position.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In discharging his or her duties, a director or an officer when acting in good faith may rely upon the opinion of legal counsel for the savings bank, upon the report of an independent appraiser selected with reasonable care by the board or by an officer of the savings bank, or upon financial statements of the savings bank represented to him or her to be correct by the president or the officer of the savings bank having charge of its books of account, or as stated in a written report by an independent public or certified public accountant or firm of accountants fairly to reflect the financial condition of the savings bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The articles of incorporation of a savings bank may contain a provision providing that a director is not personally liable to the savings bank or its shareholders or members for monetary damages for a breach of the director's fiduciary duty. The provision does not eliminate or limit the liability of a director for any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the savings bank or its shareholders or members.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A violation of section 223.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   An action against a director or officer for failure to perform the duties imposed by this section shall be commenced within 3 years after the cause of action has accrued, or within 2 years after the time when the cause of action is discovered, or should reasonably have been discovered, by the complainant, whichever occurs first.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a director or officer of a savings bank knowingly violates, or knowingly permits any of the agents, officers, directors, or employees of the savings bank to violate, this act, rules promulgated under this act, or an order or declaratory ruling of the commissioner, every director and officer who participated in or assented to the violation shall be held liable in his or her personal and individual capacity for all damages that the savings bank, any shareholder, or any other person sustains as a result of the violation. An action to recover damages under this section shall be brought within 3 years from the time of the violation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The shareholders may remove 1 or more directors with or without cause unless the articles provide that directors may be removed only for cause. The vote for removal shall be by a majority of shares entitled to vote at an election of directors, except that the articles may require a higher vote for removal without cause. This subsection shall not invalidate any bylaw adopted before the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection that applies to removal without cause.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   In the case of a savings bank having cumulative voting, if less than the entire board is to be removed, a director shall not be removed if the votes cast against his or her removal would be sufficient to elect him or her if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire board of directors, or, if there are classes of directors, at an election of the class of directors of which he or she is a part.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If holders of a class or series of stock are entitled by the articles to elect 1 or more directors, this section applies, with respect to removal of a director so elected, to the vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of that class or series of stock.</DIV>

The termination of an action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner that he or she reasonably believed to be in and not opposed to the best interests of the savings bank or its members or shareholders, and in a criminal action or proceeding create a presumption that the person had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A savings bank may indemnify a person who was or is a party to or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the savings bank to procure a judgment in its favor or by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of the savings bank or is or was serving at the request of the savings bank as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another financial institution, foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, whether for profit or not, against expenses, including actual and reasonable attorneys' fees and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in and not opposed to the best interests of the savings bank or its shareholders or members.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A director, officer, employee, or agent of the savings bank who is a party or threatened to be made a party to an action, suit, or proceeding may apply for indemnification to the court conducting the proceeding or to another court of competent jurisdiction. On receipt of an application, the court after giving any notice it considers necessary may order indemnification if it determines that the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances, whether or not he or she met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this section or was adjudged liable, but if he or she was adjudged liable, his or her indemnification is limited to reasonable expenses incurred.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An application under this section shall specify the name and capital and surplus of the bank filing it, the powers applied for and the places where the banking operations are to be carried on.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Every savings bank operating foreign branches under this section shall furnish information concerning the condition of the branches to the commissioner upon demand, and every savings bank investing in capital stock of banking organizations or corporations as provided under this section shall furnish information concerning the condition of the banking organizations or corporations to the commissioner upon demand.

If at any time the commissioner has ascertained that the orders or rulings prescribed by him or her are not being complied with, the commissioner may institute an investigation of the matter and subpoena witnesses and documents and administer oaths. If the investigation results in establishing the failure of the banking organization or corporation in question, or of the savings bank which is a stockholder, to comply with the rules of the commissioner, the commissioner may order the savings bank to dispose of stockholdings in the banking organization or corporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Orders or rulings issued by the commissioner, in addition to regulating powers which a foreign branch may exercise under other provisions of law, may authorize a foreign branch, subject to such conditions and requirements as the orders or rulings prescribe, to exercise any further powers as may be usual in connection with the transaction of the business of banking in the places where the foreign branch transacts business. The orders or rulings shall not authorize a foreign branch to engage in the general business of producing, distributing, buying, or selling goods, wares, or merchandise. Except to such limited extent as the commissioner may deem to be necessary with respect to securities issued by any foreign government or any department, district, province, county, possession, or other similar governmental organization or subdivision of a foreign government, and any agency or instrumentality of any foreign government or of any organization or subdivision, the orders or rulings shall not authorize a foreign branch to engage or participate, directly or indirectly, in the business of underwriting, selling, or distributing securities.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 501.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If, in the opinion of the commissioner, the capital of a savings bank has become impaired, the commissioner shall notify the savings bank of his or her determination and require the directors to meet the deficiency in the capital within a 2-month period. The directors shall meet the deficiency by either making a pro rata assessment upon the stock held by each shareholder, or taking steps to dissolve the bank. The 2-month period may be extended by order of the commissioner, if in his or her discretion an extension is necessary to allow the directors to meet the deficiency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Before an assessment may be made by the directors, each shareholder, secured party, and pledgee indicated on the books of the savings bank as holding an interest in the stock shall be provided with written notice in a manner reasonably calculated to give actual notice of the determination made by the commissioner that the capital of the savings bank is impaired and the amount of the assessment that each shareholder must pay.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a shareholder refuses or neglects to pay an assessment levied by the directors within 30 days from the date notice was provided, the directors shall sell all or part of the shareholder's shares to the highest bidder in a manner provided in this section. Upon expiration of the 30-day period and refusal or neglect by a shareholder to pay the assessment, a security interest in favor of the savings bank in the amount of the assessment shall attach to all of the shareholder's shares for the sole purpose of satisfying the assessment levied. The security interest shall have priority over any other security interests perfected by a creditor or otherwise granted by the shareholder in shares issued after the effective date of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the directors fail to restore the capital of the savings bank or take steps to dissolve the savings bank during the 2-month period following notice from the commissioner and any extension granted under subsection (1), the commissioner may appoint a receiver for the savings bank in accordance with this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If any part of the capital of a savings bank consists of preferred stock, the determination of whether the capital of the savings bank is impaired and the amount of the impairment shall be based upon the par value of its stock even though the amount that the holders of the preferred stock shall be entitled to receive in the event of retirement or dissolution shall be in excess of the par value of the preferred stock.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The holders of preferred stock shall not be liable for assessments to restore impairment in the capital of a savings bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If, 30 days after notice as provided in this section, a shareholder has refused or neglected to pay an assessment levied on the shares held by the shareholder, the directors may sell any or all of the shareholder's shares to satisfy the assessment. The proceeds of the sale shall be distributed in the following order:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The reasonable expenses of holding for sale and selling the stock in a manner not prohibited by law, including reasonable attorney fees and legal expenses incurred by the savings bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The satisfaction of the assessment levied by the directors.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The satisfaction of an indebtedness secured by any security interest in the stock if written notification demanding proceeds is received by the savings bank before distribution of the proceeds is completed. Unless the holder of a security interest provides reasonable proof of the interest, the savings bank does not have to comply with this subdivision.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Any remaining surplus shall be distributed to the shareholder.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Disposition of the stock may be at a public or private sale at any time and on any terms, but every aspect of the disposition including the method, manner, time, place, and terms shall be commercially reasonable and reasonably calculated to meet the deficiency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   A sale of stock as provided in this section shall effect an absolute cancellation of any outstanding certificates evidencing the stock sold and any security interest granted or pledge made in stock issued after the effective date of this act. Upon full payment of the stock sold, the savings bank shall issue new certificates to the purchaser.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   The purchaser takes the stock free of any rights or interests the shareholder may have based on an unintentional failure by the savings bank to comply with this section if all of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The purchaser has no knowledge of any defect in the proceedings.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The purchaser does not act in collusion with any shareholders of the savings bank, a secured party, other bidders, or the savings bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The purchaser makes the purchase in good faith.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   The ability of a savings bank to make an assessment under this section or to sell the stock of a shareholder under this section is not limited by the uniform commercial code.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If any of the grounds set forth in section 601 authorizing the appointment of a receiver exist or whenever the commissioner considers it necessary in order to conserve the assets of a savings bank for the benefit of the depositors and other creditors, the commissioner may appoint a conservator for the savings bank and require of him or her a bond and security as the commissioner considers necessary.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The commissioner may appoint as conservator 1 of the bank examiners of the bureau or some other competent and disinterested person. The bureau shall be reimbursed out of the assets of the conservatorship for all sums expended by it in connection with the conservatorship as expenses or otherwise, and the funds shall be paid into the revolving fund provided for in section 607.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A conservator appointed under this section shall become a member of the bureau. All expenses of a conservatorship shall be paid out of the assets of the savings bank, upon the approval of the commissioner. The expenses shall be a first charge upon the assets and shall be fully paid before any final distribution or payment of dividends to creditors, shareholders, or members.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The conservator, under the direction of the commissioner, shall take possession of the books, records, and assets of the savings bank, and take such action as may be necessary to conserve the assets of the savings bank pending further disposition of its business as provided by law. The conservator shall have all the rights, powers, and privileges of receivers of banks appointed under this act and shall be subject to the obligations and penalties, not inconsistent with this act with respect to conservators, to which receivers are subject. During the time that the conservator remains in possession of the savings bank, the rights of all parties with respect to the savings bank, subject to other provisions of this act with respect to conservators, shall be the same as if a receiver had been appointed. The conservator may execute the discharge of any real estate mortgage held as part of the assets of the savings bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   While a savings bank is in the hands of the conservator appointed by the commissioner, the commissioner may require the conservator to set aside and make available for withdrawal by depositors and payment to other creditors, on a ratable basis, such amounts as in the opinion of the commissioner may be used safely for that purpose. The commissioner may permit the conservator to receive deposits. Deposits received while the savings bank is in the hands of the conservator shall not be subject to any limitation as to payment or withdrawal. The deposits and any new assets acquired on account of the deposits shall be segregated and held especially for the new deposits and not be used to liquidate any indebtedness of the savings bank existing at the time that a conservator was appointed or any subsequent indebtedness incurred for the purpose of liquidating any indebtedness of the savings bank existing at the time the conservator was appointed. Deposits received while the savings bank is in the hands of the conservator shall be kept on hand in cash, invested in the direct obligations of the United States, or deposited in banks designated by the commissioner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   With the prior approval of the commissioner, the conservator of a savings bank may borrow money as necessary or expedient in aiding the operation, reorganization, or liquidation of the savings bank, including the payment of liquidating dividends, and may secure the loans by the pledge, hypothecation, or mortgage of the assets of the savings bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If the commissioner is satisfied that it may be done safely and that it would be in the public interest, he or she may terminate the conservatorship and permit the savings bank to resume the transaction of its business subject to such terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations as he or she may prescribe.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The commissioner is satisfied that the plan of reorganization is fair and equitable as to all depositors, other creditors and shareholders or members and is in the public interest and has approved the plan subject to such conditions, restrictions, and limitations as he or she may require.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   After reasonable notice of the reorganization as determined by the commissioner, depositors and other creditors of the savings bank representing not less than 75% in amount of the sum of its total deposits and other liabilities as shown by the books of the savings bank, or shareholders owning at least 2/3 of its outstanding capital stock or 2/3 of the eligible voting members if it is a mutual savings bank as shown by the books of the savings bank, shall have consented in writing to the plan of reorganization. Claims of depositors or other creditors which will be satisfied in full under the plan of reorganization shall not be included among the total deposits and other liabilities of the savings bank in determining the 75% of total deposits. The term "reorganization" as used in this section may be construed to include the establishment of a new savings bank in conformity with a plan of reorganization.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In a reorganization which has been approved and become effective, all depositors and other creditors and shareholders or members of the savings bank, whether or not they have consented to the plan of reorganization, shall be subject to and bound by its provisions and claims of all depositors and other creditors shall be treated as if they had consented to the plan or reorganization. The state or any department, agency, or political subdivision of the state holding a claim against the savings bank is authorized to participate in a plan of reorganization as any other creditor and shall be subject to and bound by its provisions as any other creditor.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Subject to approval by the commissioner, a savings bank may consolidate with any number of consolidating organizations to form a consolidated savings bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The approval of the commissioner shall be based on an examination or other appropriate analysis of each consolidating organization and the agreement of consolidation. A consolidation shall not be made to defeat or defraud any of the creditors of any of the consolidating organizations.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A majority of the directors of each organization proposing to consolidate may enter into an agreement, signed by them, or by their designated representative or representatives prescribing the terms and conditions of consolidation, the mode of carrying the consolidation into effect and stating other facts required or permitted by this act and other applicable law that are to be set out in the articles, as can be stated in the case of a consolidation, to be stated in such altered form as the circumstances of the case require, as well as the manner of converting the shares or membership interest of each of the consolidating organizations, into shares or membership interest of the consolidated organization, with other details and provisions as are considered necessary.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Enter into agreements governing the sharing and use of information that are consistent with this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The disclosure of any documents, materials, or information to the director, or the sharing of documents, materials, or information under subsection (11), is not a waiver of, and shall not be construed as a waiver of, any privilege applicable to or claim of confidentiality in those documents, materials, or information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) A person to which confidential and privileged documents, materials, or information is disclosed shall not further disseminate those confidential and privileged documents, materials, or information.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) The director may immediately appeal any court order described in subsection (16) that compels disclosure of confidential and privileged documents, materials, or information, and the order is automatically stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) Within 1 year after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection, the director shall issue guidance to promote consistency and due process in the examination process under this section, including, but not limited to, establishing guidelines that define the scope of the examination process and clarify how examination issues will be resolved.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   After a bank has commenced dissolution, the commissioner, the bank in dissolution, a creditor, or a shareholder may apply to an appropriate court for an order that the affairs of the bank in dissolution and the liquidation of its assets continue under supervision of the court. The court shall make orders and judgments as may be required, including, but not limited to, continuance of the liquidation of the assets of the bank in dissolution by its liquidating agent or committee under supervision of the court, or the appointment of a receiver of the bank in dissolution to be vested with powers as the court designates to liquidate the affairs of the bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For good cause shown, and so long as a bank in dissolution has not made complete distribution of its assets, the court may permit a creditor who has not delivered his or her claim or commenced a proceeding to enforce his or her claim within the time limits provided in sections 3304 and 3305 to file the claim or to commence a proceeding within the time as the court directs.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Before making a distribution of assets to shareholders, a bank in dissolution shall pay or make provision to satisfy its debts, obligations, and liabilities.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Provision need not be made to satisfy any debt, obligation, or liability that is or is reasonably anticipated to be barred under section 3304 or 3305.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The fact that the assets provided by the bank in dissolution for the satisfaction of its debts, obligations, and liabilities are insufficient to satisfy claims arising after a certificate of termination is filed under section 3301(9) shall not create a presumption that the bank in dissolution has failed to comply with this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   After payment of or adequate provision to satisfy the debts, obligations, or liabilities of the bank in dissolution has been made, the remaining assets shall be distributed to shareholders according to their respective rights and interests.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A director or an officer of a bank shall discharge the duties of his or her position in good faith and with that degree of diligence, care, and skill that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances in a like position. In discharging his or her duties, a director or an officer, when acting in good faith, may rely upon the opinion of legal counsel for the bank, upon the report of an independent appraiser selected with reasonable care by the board or by an officer of the bank, or upon financial statements of the bank certified to him or her to be correct by an officer of the bank, or as stated in a written report by an independent public or certified public accountant or firm of accountants to reflect fairly the financial condition of the bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The articles of incorporation of a bank may provide that a director is not personally liable to the bank or its shareholders for monetary damages for a breach of the director's fiduciary duty. The provision does not eliminate or limit the liability of a director for any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the bank or its shareholders.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A violation of section 2312.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   An action against a director or officer for failure to perform the duties imposed by this section shall be commenced within 3 years after the cause of action has accrued, or within 2 years after the time when the cause of action is discovered, or should reasonably have been discovered, by the complainant, whichever occurs first.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a director or officer of a bank knowingly violates, or knowingly permits any of the agents, officers, directors, or employees of the bank to violate, this act, rules promulgated under this act, or an order or declaratory ruling of the commissioner, every director and officer who participated in or assented to the violation shall be held liable in his or her personal and individual capacity for all damages that the bank, any shareholder, or any other person sustains as a result of the violation. An action to recover damages under this section shall be brought within 3 years from the time of the violation.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If holders of a class or series of stock are entitled by the articles to elect 1 or more directors, this section applies, with respect to removal of a director so elected, to the vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of that class or series of stock.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Subject to approval by the commissioner, a bank may consolidate with any number of consolidating organizations to form a consolidated bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The approval of the commissioner shall be based on an examination or other appropriate analysis of each consolidating organization and the agreement of consolidation.

A transfer of stock shall not be valid against the bank, except with the consent of the board of directors, so long as the registered holder of the stock is liable as principal debtor, surety, or otherwise to the bank for any debt which is due and unpaid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, the board may authorize the issuance of some or all of the shares of any or all of its classes or series of stock without certificates if within a reasonable time after issuance of a share without a certificate the bank provides the shareholder with a written statement of the information required on a certificate under subsection (5). The authorization shall not have any effect on shares already represented by certificates unless they are surrendered to the bank.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the registered holder of stock of a bank is liable to the bank as principal debtor, surety or otherwise for any debt which is due and unpaid, the directors of the bank may sell a sufficient amount of the stock of the delinquent shareholder in the same manner and with the same effect as provided in section 3808. This section does not prevent the bank from bringing proceedings to recover the entire amount of the indebtedness at any time before the sale or to recover the balance of the debt and costs after the proceeds of sale have been applied against the debt and costs or to recover the balance of the debt after the cancellation of the stock.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Except as provided in sections 3807 and 3808, the rights of a bank in its stock in which the shareholder is liable to the bank as principal debtor, surety, or otherwise is subject to any pledge, sale, or other transfer of the stock that is made before the maturity of an indebtedness of the registered holder of the stock to the bank and of which the bank has knowledge before the maturity, whether or not the stock was transferred on the books of the bank. Any stock of a bank that is pledged, sold, or otherwise transferred before the maturity of any indebtedness of the registered holder of the stock to the bank and of which pledge, sale, or other transfer the bank has knowledge before the maturity, may be transferred on the books of the bank after the maturity without the consent of the board of directors of the bank. The rights of a bank in its stock under this section, including the limitation on transferability if the registered holder is liable to the bank for any debt that is due and unpaid, shall not be applicable with respect to any stock duly listed on any stock exchange.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Each certificate issued after the effective date of this act shall state all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The name and address of the principal office of the bank.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 3804.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   By a vote of shareholders owning 2/3 of each class of the stock entitled to vote, a bank may amend its articles to increase its capital stock to any sum approved by the commissioner, either by an increase in the par value of authorized stock or by the authorization of new stock.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An increase in capital shall not be valid until the whole amount of the increase has been paid in, notice of the payment signed by an officer of the bank has been transmitted to the commissioner, and the commissioner's certificate of approval has been obtained specifying the amount of the increase in capital and that it has been duly paid in as a part of the capital of the bank. The certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the stock has been duly and validly issued.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In the case of the issuance of new stock, in voting upon the increase of capital stock, 2/3 of the shareholders entitled to vote shall have power to fix the value of, and the price at which the stock shall be subscribed and paid for by the shareholders, but not less than par, as well as the time and manner of the subscription and payment, and to authorize the directors to sell the stock.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Retirement of preferred stock in accordance with the articles of incorporation is not considered to be a reduction of capital under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A shareholder shall not be entitled to any distribution of cash or other assets by reason of any reduction of the common capital of any bank unless the distribution has been approved by the commissioner and by the affirmative vote of at least 2/3 of the shares of each class of stock outstanding, voting as classes.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A cash dividend or dividend in kind shall not be declared or paid unless the bank will have a surplus amounting to not less than 20% of its capital after the payment of the dividend.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A cash dividend or dividend in kind shall not be declared by a bank except out of net income then on hand after deducting its losses and bad debts. Unless the debts due the bank on which interest is past due and unpaid for a period of 6 months are well secured and in process of collection or the debts constitute claims against solvent estates in probate, all debts shall be considered bad debts within the meaning of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A cash dividend or dividend in kind shall not be declared or paid until the cumulative dividends on preferred stock, if any, have been paid in full. By their unanimous vote, the preferred shareholders may waive their right to any amount of the accumulated but unpaid dividends.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If at any time the surplus of a bank is less than the amount of its capital, before the declaration of a cash dividend or dividend in kind, it shall transfer to surplus not less than 10% of its net income of the preceding 6 months in the case of quarterly or semiannual dividends, or not less than 10% of its net income of the preceding 2 consecutive 6-month periods in the case of annual dividends. For the purpose of this section, any amounts transferred to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock of the bank out of its net income for the periods are considered to be additions to its surplus, if, upon the retirement of the preferred stock, the amounts credited into the retirement fund may then properly be carried to surplus. In this case, the bank shall be obligated to credit to surplus the amounts transferred into the retirement fund on account of the preferred stock as the stock is retired.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If, in the opinion of the commissioner, the capital of a bank has become impaired, the commissioner shall notify the bank of his or her determination and require the directors to meet the deficiency in the capital within a 2-month period. The directors shall meet the deficiency by either making a pro rata assessment upon the stock held by each shareholder, or taking steps to dissolve the bank. The 2-month period may be extended by order of the commissioner, if in his or her discretion an extension is necessary to allow the directors to meet the deficiency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Before an assessment may be made by the directors, each shareholder, secured party, and pledgee indicated on the books of the bank as holding an interest in the stock shall be provided with written notice in a manner reasonably calculated to give actual notice of the determination made by the commissioner that the capital of the bank is impaired and the amount of the assessment that each shareholder must pay.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a shareholder refuses or neglects to pay an assessment levied by the directors within 30 days from the date notice was provided, the directors shall sell all or part of the shareholder's shares to the highest bidder in a manner provided in section 3808. Upon expiration of the 30-day period and refusal or neglect by a shareholder to pay the assessment, a security interest in favor of the bank in the amount of the assessment shall attach to all of the shareholder's shares for the sole purpose of satisfying the assessment levied. The security interest shall have priority over any other security interests perfected by a creditor or otherwise granted by the shareholder in shares issued after the effective date of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the directors fail to restore the capital of the bank or take steps to dissolve the bank during the 2-month period following notice from the commissioner and any extension granted under subsection (1), the commissioner may appoint a receiver for the bank in accordance with this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If any part of the capital of a bank consists of preferred stock, the determination of whether the capital of the bank is impaired and the amount of the impairment shall be based upon the par value of its stock even though the amount that the holders of the preferred stock shall be entitled to receive in the event of retirement or dissolution shall be in excess of the par value of the preferred stock.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Any remaining surplus shall be distributed to the shareholder.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Disposition of the stock may be at a public or private sale at any time and on any terms, but every aspect of the disposition including the method, manner, time, place, and terms shall be commercially reasonable and reasonably calculated to meet the deficiency.</DIV>

Upon full payment of the stock sold, the bank shall issue new certificates to the purchaser.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A bank may indemnify a person described in subsection (2) who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any type of threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, other than an action by or in the right of the bank, against expenses, including attorney fees, judgments, penalties, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the action, suit, or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the bank or its shareholders and with respect to a criminal action or proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Subsection (1) applies to a person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the bank or is or was serving at the request of the bank as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another depository institution, foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, whether for profit or not.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The termination of an action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner that he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the bank or its shareholders and with respect to a criminal action or proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A bank may indemnify a person who was or is a party to or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the bank to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the bank or is or was serving at the request of the bank as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another bank or national banking association, foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, whether for profit or not, against expenses, including actual and reasonable attorney fees and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the action or suit, if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the bank or its shareholders. Indemnification shall not be made for a claim, issue, or matter in which the person has been found liable to the bank except as authorized in subsection (5).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A director, officer, employee, or agent of the bank who is a party or threatened to be made a party to an action, suit, or proceeding may apply for indemnification to the court conducting the proceeding or to another court of competent jurisdiction. On receipt of an application, the court after giving any notice it considers necessary may order indemnification if it determines that the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances, whether or not he or she met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this section or was adjudged liable, but if he or she was adjudged liable, his or her indemnification is limited to reasonable expenses incurred.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) In its corporate name, to take, receive, hold, repay, reconvey, and dispose of any effects and property, both real and personal, that are granted, committed, transferred, or conveyed to it with its consent, according to the terms of any agreement or trust, at any time, by any individual, minor, corporate body, court, or any other person and to administer, fulfill, and discharge the duties of the trust. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) To act as agent for the transaction of business, the management of estates, the collection of rents, interest, dividends, and money, and the collection of principal and interest on mortgages, bonds, notes, and securities for money; to enforce the payment of any of these obligations; to act as agent for the purpose of issuing, negotiating, registering, transferring, or countersigning the certificates of stock, bonds, or other obligations of any corporation, association, or municipality; and to manage any sinking fund of any corporation, association, or municipality on the terms to which the parties have agreed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) To accept and to execute the office of personal representative, trustee, receiver, conservator, liquidating agent, assignee, or guardian of any minor, incompetent person, legally incapacitated person, or any other person subject to guardianship. If an application is made to a court for the appointment of a trustee, receiver, personal representative, or guardian of any minor, incompetent person, legally incapacitated person, or any other person subject to guardianship, the court may appoint the bank or state foreign bank branch, with its consent, to hold that office. The accounts of a bank or state foreign bank branch as trustee, receiver, conservator, liquidating agent, assignee, personal representative, or guardian shall be regularly settled and adjusted by the proper office or tribunals. All proper, legal, usual, and customary charges, costs, and expenses shall be allowed to the bank or state foreign bank branch for the care and management of an estate committed to it under this section.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A bank or state foreign bank branch acting as a fiduciary may charge a reasonable fee for its services. In any action or proceeding concerning fees, there is a rebuttable presumption that a fee is reasonable if the fee or its method of computation is specified in a fee schedule or fee agreement of the bank or state foreign bank branch in effect at the time the service is provided and if the agency or custody principal, the trust grantor, or any other person who is entitled to be kept reasonably informed of the fiduciary account and its administration under the estates and protected individuals code, 1998 PA 386, MCL 700.1101 to 700.8102, received reasonable notice of that fee schedule or fee agreement before the fee is charged.</div>
