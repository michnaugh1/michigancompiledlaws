<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A co-owner may make improvements or modifications to the co-owner's condominium unit, including improvements or modifications to common elements and to the route from the public way to the door of the co-owner's condominium unit, at his or her expense, if the purpose of the improvement or modification is to facilitate access to or movement within the unit for persons with disabilities who reside in or regularly visit the unit, or to alleviate conditions that could be hazardous to persons with disabilities who reside in or regularly visit the unit. The improvement or modification shall not impair the structural integrity of a structure or otherwise lessen the support of a portion of the condominium project. The co-owner is liable for the cost of repairing any damage to a common element caused by building or maintaining the improvement or modification, unless the damage could reasonably be expected in the normal course of building or maintaining the improvement or modification. The improvement or modification may be made notwithstanding prohibitions and restrictions in the condominium documents, but shall comply with all applicable state and local building code requirements and health and safety laws and ordinances and shall be made as closely as reasonably possible in conformity with the intent of applicable prohibitions and restrictions regarding safety and aesthetics of the proposed modification.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An improvement or modification allowed by this section that affects the exterior of the condominium unit shall not unreasonably prevent passage by other residents of the condominium project. A co-owner who has made exterior improvements or modifications allowed by this section shall notify the association of co-owners in writing of the co-owner's intention to convey or lease his or her condominium unit to another at least 30 days before the conveyance or lease. Not more than 30 days after receiving a notice from a co-owner under this subsection, the association of co-owners may require the co-owner to remove the improvement or modification at the co-owner's expense. If the co-owner fails to give timely notice of a conveyance or lease, the association of co-owners at any time may remove or require the co-owner to remove the improvement or modification at the co-owner's expense. However, the association of co-owners may not remove or require the removal of an improvement or modification if a co-owner intends to resume residing in the unit within 12 months or a co-owner conveys or leases his or her condominium unit to a person with disabilities who needs the same type of improvement or modification or who has a person residing with him or her who requires the same type of improvement or modification. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a co-owner makes an exterior improvement or modification allowed under this section, the co-owner shall maintain liability insurance, underwritten by an insurer authorized to do business in this state and naming the association of co-owners as an additional insured, in an amount adequate to compensate for personal injuries caused by the exterior improvement or modification. The co-owner is not liable for acts or omissions of the association of co-owners with respect to the exterior improvement or modification and is not required to maintain liability insurance with respect to any common element. The association of co-owners is responsible for maintenance, repair, and replacement of the improvement or modification only to the extent of the cost currently incurred by the association of co-owners for maintenance, replacement, and repair of the common elements covered or replaced by the improvement or modification. All costs of maintenance, repair, and replacement of the improvement or modification exceeding that currently incurred by the association of co-owners for maintenance, repair, and replacement of the common elements covered or replaced by the improvement or modification shall be assessed to and paid by the co-owner or the unit serviced by the improvement or modification.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Before an improvement or modification allowed by this section is made, the co-owner shall submit plans and specifications for the improvements or modifications to the association of co-owners for review and approval. The association of co-owners shall determine whether the proposed improvement or modification substantially conforms to the requirements of this section and shall not deny a proposed improvement or modification without good cause. If the association of co-owners denies a proposed improvement or modification, the association of co-owners shall list, in writing, the changes needed to make the proposed improvement or modification conform to the requirements of this section and shall deliver that list to the co-owner. The association of co-owners shall approve or deny the proposed improvement or modification not later than 60 days after the plans and specifications are submitted by the co-owner proposing the improvement or modification to the association of co-owners. If the association of co-owners does not approve or deny submitted plans and specifications within the 60-day period, the co-owner may make the proposed improvement or modification without the approval of the association of co-owners. A co-owner may bring an action against the association of co-owners and the officers and directors to compel those persons to comply with this section if the co-owner disagrees with a denial by the association of co-owners of the co-owner's proposed improvement or modification.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   This section applies to condominium units existing on May 27, 1987 and to those built or converted after May 27, 1987.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   This section does not apply to a condominium unit that is otherwise required by law to be barrier-free and does not impose on a co-owner the cost of maintaining that barrier-free unit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   As used in this section, “person with disabilities” means that term as defined in section 2 of the state construction code act of 1972, 1972 PA 230, MCL 125.1502.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Notwithstanding the formula provided in subsection (2), 54 months after the first conveyance of legal or equitable title to a nondeveloper co-owner of a unit in the project, if title to not less than 75% of the units that may be created has not been conveyed, the nondeveloper co-owners have the right to elect, as provided in the condominium documents, a number of members of the board of directors of the association of co-owners equal to the percentage of units they hold and the developer has the right to elect, as provided in the condominium documents, a number of members of the board equal to the percentage of units which are owned by the developer and for which all assessments are payable by the developer. This election may increase, but does not reduce, the minimum election and designation rights otherwise established in subsection (2). Application of this subsection does not require a change in the size of the board as determined in the condominium documents.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the calculation of the percentage of members of the board that the nondeveloper co-owners have the right to elect under subsection (2), or if the product of the number of members of the board multiplied by the percentage of units held by the nondeveloper co-owners under subsection (3) results in a right of nondeveloper co-owners to elect a fractional number of members of the board, then a fractional election right of 0.5 or greater shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number, which number shall be the number of members of the board that the nondeveloper co-owners have the right to elect. After application of the formula contained in this subsection, the developer has the right to elect the remaining members of the board. Application of this subsection does not eliminate the right of the developer to designate 1 member as provided in subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A consolidating master deed and plans showing the condominium as built shall be recorded not later than 1 year after completion of construction in order to consolidate all phases or amendments of a condominium project. A copy of the recorded consolidating master deed shall be provided to the association of co-owners.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   As used in this section, “units that may be created” means the maximum number of units in all phases of the condominium project as stated in the master deed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   For purposes of calculating the timing of events described in this section, conveyance by a developer to a residential builder, even though not an affiliate of the developer, is not considered a sale to a nondeveloper co-owner until such time as the residential builder conveys that unit with a completed residence on it or until it contains a completed residence which is occupied.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 54.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The bylaws shall contain provisions for the designation of persons to administer the affairs of the condominium project and shall require that those persons keep books and records with a detailed account of the expenditures and receipts affecting the condominium project and its administration, and which specify the operating expenses of the project.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The bylaws shall provide that the person designated to administer the affairs of the project shall be assessed as the person in possession for any tangible personal property of the project owned or possessed in common by the co-owners. Personal property taxes based on that tangible personal property shall be treated as expenses of administration.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The bylaws shall contain specific provisions directing the courses of action to be taken in the event of partial or complete destruction of the building or buildings in the project.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The bylaws shall provide that expenditures affecting the administration of the project shall include costs incurred in the satisfaction of any liability arising within, caused by, or connected with, the common elements or the administration of the condominium project, and that receipts affecting the administration of the condominium project shall include all sums received as the proceeds of, or pursuant to, a policy of insurance securing the interest of the co-owners against liabilities or losses arising within, caused by, or connected with the common elements or the administration of the condominium project.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The bylaws shall provide that the association of co-owners shall prepare and distribute to each owner at least once each year a financial statement, the contents of which shall be defined by the association of co-owners.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The bylaws shall provide an indemnification clause for the board of directors of the association of co-owners. The indemnification clause shall require that 10 days' notice, before payment under the clause, be given to the co-owners. The indemnification clause shall exclude indemnification for willful and wanton misconduct and for gross negligence.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The bylaws may allocate to each condominium unit a number of votes in the association of co-owners proportionate to the percentage of value appertaining to each condominium unit, or an equal number of votes in the association of co-owners.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The bylaws shall contain a provision providing that arbitration of disputes, claims, and grievances arising out of or relating to the interpretation of the application of the condominium document or arising out of disputes among or between co-owners shall be submitted to arbitration and that the parties to the dispute, claim, or grievance shall accept the arbitrator's decision as final and binding, upon the election and written consent of the parties to the disputes, claims, or grievances and upon written notice to the association. The commercial arbitration rules of the American arbitration association are applicable to any such arbitration.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   In the absence of the election and written consent of the parties under subsection (8), neither a co-owner nor the association is prohibited from petitioning a court of competent jurisdiction to resolve any dispute, claim, or grievance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   The election by the parties to submit any dispute, claim, or grievance to arbitration prohibits the parties from petitioning the courts regarding that dispute, claim, or grievance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   Subsections (8), (9), and (10) apply only to condominium projects established on or after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A change in a condominium project shall be reflected in an amendment to the appropriate condominium document. An amendment to the condominium document is subject to sections 90, 90a, and 91.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a change involves a change in the boundaries of a condominium unit or the addition or elimination of condominium units, a replat of the condominium subdivision plan shall be prepared and recorded assigning a condominium unit number to each condominium unit in the amended project. The replat of the condominium subdivision plan shall be designated replat number __________ of __________ county condominium subdivision plan number __________, using the same plan number assigned to the original condominium subdivision plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Notwithstanding section 33, for 10 years after the recording of the master deed, the developer, its successors, or assigns may withdraw from the project any undeveloped land or convert the undeveloped condominium units located thereon to "must be built" without the prior consent of any co-owners, mortgagees of condominium units in the project, or any other party having an interest in the project. If the master deed confers on the developer expansion, contraction, or convertibility rights with respect to condominium units or common elements in the condominium project, then the time period is 10 years after the recording of the master deed or 6 years after the recording of the amendment to the master deed by which the developer last exercised its expansion, contraction, or convertibility rights, whichever period ends later. Any undeveloped land so withdrawn is automatically granted easements for utility and access purposes through the condominium project for the benefit of the undeveloped land. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the developer does not withdraw undeveloped land from the project or convert undeveloped condominium units to "must be built" before expiration of the applicable time period under subsection (3), the association of co-owners, by an affirmative 2/3 majority vote of the members in good standing, may declare that the undeveloped land shall remain part of the project but shall revert to general common elements and that all rights to construct condominium units upon that undeveloped land shall cease. When such a declaration is made, the association of co-owners shall provide written notice of the declaration to the developer or any successor developer by first-class mail at its last known address. Within 60 days after receipt of the notice, the developer or any successor developer may withdraw the undeveloped land or convert the undeveloped condominium units to "must be built". However, if the undeveloped land is not withdrawn or the undeveloped condominium units are not converted within 60 days, the association of co-owners may file the notice of the declaration with the register of deeds. The declaration takes effect upon recording by the register of deeds. The association of co-owners shall also file notice of the declaration with the local supervisor or assessing officer. In such an event, if it becomes necessary to adjust percentages of value as a result of fewer condominium units existing, a co-owner or the association of co-owners may bring an action to require revisions to the percentages of value under section 95.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A reversion under subsection (4), whether occurring before or after the date of the 2016 amendatory act that added this subsection, is not effective unless the election, notice, and recording requirements of subsection (4) have been met. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Subsections (3) and (4) do not apply to condominium units no longer owned by the developer or by the owner of the property at the time the property became part of the condominium project, unless the purchaser from the developer or owner of the property at the time the property became part of the condominium project is a successor developer under section 135.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) As used in this section, "undeveloped land" means land on which were recorded 1 or more condominium units, none of which were either identified in the condominium subdivision plan as "must be built" or have had construction commenced, although infrastructure construction or common element construction may have commenced. Undeveloped land does not include condominium units that are depicted or described on the condominium subdivision plan pursuant to section 66 as containing no vertical improvements.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The condominium documents may be amended without the consent of co-owners or mortgagees if the amendment does not materially alter or change the rights of a co-owner or mortgagee and if the condominium documents contain a reservation of the right to amend for that purpose to the developer or the association of co-owners. An amendment that does not materially change the rights of a co-owner or mortgagee includes, but is not limited to, a modification of the types and sizes of unsold condominium units and their appurtenant limited common elements.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as provided in this section, the master deed, bylaws, and condominium subdivision plan may be amended, even if the amendment will materially alter or change the rights of the co-owners or mortgagees, with the consent of not less than 2/3 of the votes of the co-owners and mortgagees. A mortgagee shall have 1 vote for each mortgage held. The 2/3 majority required in this section may not be increased by the terms of the condominium documents, and a provision in any condominium documents that requires the consent of a greater proportion of co-owners or mortgagees for the purposes described in this subsection is void and is superseded by this subsection. Mortgagees are not required to appear at any meeting of co-owners except that their approval shall be solicited through written ballots. Any mortgagee ballots not returned within 90 days of mailing shall be counted as approval for the change.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The developer may reserve, in the condominium documents, the right to amend materially the condominium documents to achieve specified purposes, except a purpose provided for in subsection (4). Reserved rights shall not be amended except by or with the consent of the developer. If a proper reservation is made, the condominium documents may be amended to achieve the specified purposes without the consent of co-owners or mortgagees.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The method or formula used to determine the percentage of value of units in the project for other than voting purposes shall not be modified without the consent of each affected co-owner and mortgagee. A co-owner's condominium unit dimensions or appurtenant limited common elements may not be modified without the co-owner's consent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Co-owners shall be notified of proposed amendments under this section not less than 10 days before the amendment is recorded.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A person causing or requesting an amendment to the condominium documents shall be responsible for costs and expenses of the amendment, except for amendments based upon a vote of a prescribed majority of co-owners and mortgagees or based upon the advisory committee's decision, the costs of which are expenses of administration.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A master deed amendment, including the consolidating master deed, dealing with the addition, withdrawal, or modification of units or other physical characteristics of the project shall comply with the standards prescribed in section 66 for preparation of an original condominium subdivision plan for the project.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   For purposes of this section, the affirmative vote of a 2/3 of co-owners is considered 2/3 of all co-owners entitled to vote as of the record date for such votes.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 90a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   To the extent this act or the condominium documents require a vote of mortgagees of units on amendment of the condominium documents, the procedure described in this section applies.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The date on which the proposed amendment is approved by the requisite majority of co-owners is considered the “control date”.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Only those mortgagees who hold a recorded first mortgage or a recorded assignment of a first mortgage against 1 or more condominium units in the condominium project on the control date are entitled to vote on the amendment. Each mortgagee entitled to vote shall have 1 vote for each condominium unit in the project that is subject to its mortgage or mortgages, without regard to how many mortgages the mortgagee may hold on a particular condominium unit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The association of co-owners shall give a notice to each mortgagee entitled to vote containing all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A copy of the amendment or amendments as passed by the co-owners.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A statement of the date that the amendment was approved by the requisite majority of co-owners.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   An envelope addressed to the entity authorized by the board of directors for tabulating mortgagee votes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A statement containing language in substantially the form described in subsection (5).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   A ballot providing spaces for approving or rejecting the amendment and a space for the signature of the mortgagee or an officer of the mortgagee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   A statement of the number of condominium units subject to the mortgage or mortgages of the mortgagee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   The date by which the mortgagee must return its ballot.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The notice provided by subsection (4) shall contain a statement in substantially the following form:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   “A review of the association records reveals that you are the holder of 1 or more mortgages recorded against title to 1 or more units in the (name of project) condominium. The co-owners of the condominium adopted the attached amendment to the condominium documents on (control date). Pursuant to the terms of the condominium documents and/or the Michigan condominium act, you are entitled to vote on the amendment. You have 1 vote for each unit that is subject to your mortgage or mortgages.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The amendment will be considered approved by first mortgagees if it is approved by 66-2/3% of those mortgagees. In order to vote, you must indicate your approval or rejection on the enclosed ballot, sign it, and return it not later than 90 days after this notice (which date coincides with the date of mailing). Failure to timely return a ballot will constitute a vote for approval. If you oppose the amendment, you must vote against it.”.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The amendment is considered to be approved by the first mortgagees if it is approved by 66-2/3% of the first mortgagees whose ballots are received, or are considered to be received, in accordance with section 90(2), by the entity authorized by the board of directors to tabulate mortgagee votes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The association of co-owners shall mail the notice required under subsection (4) to the first mortgagee at the address provided in the mortgage or assignment for notices.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The association of co-owners shall maintain a copy of the notice, proofs of mailing of the notice, and the ballots returned by mortgagees for a period of 2 years after the control date.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   Notwithstanding any provision of the condominium documents to the contrary, first mortgagees are entitled to vote on amendments to the condominium documents only under the following circumstances:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Termination of the condominium project.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A change in the method or formula used to determine the percentage of value assigned to a unit subject to the mortgagee's mortgage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A reallocation of responsibility for maintenance, repair, replacement, or decoration for a condominium unit, its appurtenant limited common elements, or the general common elements from the association of co-owners to the condominium unit subject to the mortgagee's mortgage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Elimination of a requirement for the association of co-owners to maintain insurance on the project as a whole or a condominium unit subject to the mortgagee's mortgage or reallocation of responsibility for obtaining or maintaining, or both, insurance from the association of co-owners to the condominium unit subject to the mortgagee's mortgage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The modification or elimination of an easement benefiting the condominium unit subject to the mortgagee's mortgage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The partial or complete modification, imposition, or removal of leasing restrictions for condominium units in the condominium project.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Amendments requiring the consent of all affected mortgagees under section 90(4).</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 103b.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    This section shall not apply to a business condominium unit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Deposits in escrow with an escrow agent required under sections 83 and 84 shall be released pursuant to those sections upon cancellation of a preliminary reservation agreement or withdrawal from a purchase agreement, and in all other cases shall be retained and released pursuant to this section and condominium documents which are not inconsistent with this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as provided in subsection (5), amounts required to be retained in escrow in connection with the purchase of a unit shall be released to the developer pursuant to subsection (6) only upon all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the unit, if required by local ordinance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Conveyance of legal or equitable title to the unit to the purchaser.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Receipt by the escrow agent of a certificate signed by a licensed professional engineer or architect either confirming that those portions of the phase of the project in which the condominium unit is located and which on the condominium subdivision plan are labeled “must be built” are substantially complete, or determining the amount necessary for substantial completion thereof.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Receipt by the escrow agent of a certificate signed by a licensed professional engineer or architect either confirming that recreational or other facilities which on the condominium subdivision plan are labeled “must be built”, whether located within or outside of the phase of the project in which the condominium unit is located, and which are intended for common use, are substantially complete, or determining the amount necessary for substantial completion thereof. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Substantial completion and the estimated cost for substantial completion of the items described in subsections (3)(c) and (3)(d) and in subsection (6) shall be determined by a licensed professional engineer or architect, as provided in subsection (4)(b), subject to the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Items referred to in subsection (3)(c) shall be substantially complete only after all utility mains and leads, all major structural components of buildings, all building exteriors and all sidewalks, driveways, landscaping and access roads, to the extent such items are designated on the condominium subdivision plan as “must be built”, are substantially complete in accordance with the pertinent plans therefor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)    If the estimated cost of substantial completion of any of the items referred to in subsection (3)(c) and (d) cannot be determined by a licensed professional engineer or architect due to the absence of plans, specifications, or other details that are sufficiently complete to enable such a determination to be made, such cost shall be the minimum expenditure specified in the recorded master deed or amendment for completion thereof. To the extent that any item referred to in subsection (3)(c) and (d) is specifically depicted on the condominium subdivision plan, an estimate of the cost of substantial completion prepared by a licensed professional engineer or architect shall be required in place of the minimum expenditure specified in the recorded master deed or amendment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A structure, element, facility or other improvement shall be deemed to be substantially complete when it can be reasonably employed for its intended use and, for purposes of certification under this section, shall not be required to be constructed, installed, or furnished precisely in accordance with the specifications for the project. A certificate of substantial completion shall not be deemed to be a certification as to the quality of the items to which it relates.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   In place of retaining funds in escrow under subsection (3), the developer may, if the escrow agreement so provides, furnish an escrow agent with evidence of adequate security, including, without limitation, an irrevocable letter of credit, lending commitment, indemnification agreement, or other resource having a value, in the judgment of the escrow agent, of not less than the amount retained pursuant to subsection (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Upon receipt of a certificate issued pursuant to subsection (3)(c) and (d) determining the amounts necessary for substantial completion, the escrow agent may release to the developer all funds in escrow in excess of the amounts determined by the issuer of such certificate to be necessary for substantial completion. In addition, upon receipt by the escrow agent of a certificate signed by a licensed professional engineer or architect confirming substantial completion in accordance with the pertinent plans of an item for which funds have been deposited in escrow, the escrow agent shall release to the developer the amount of such funds specified by the issuer of the certificate as being attributable to such substantially completed item. However, if the amounts remaining in escrow after such partial release would be insufficient in the opinion of the issuer of such certificate for substantial completion of any remaining incomplete items for which funds have been deposited in escrow, only the amount in escrow in excess of such estimated cost to substantially complete shall be released by the escrow agent to the developer. Notwithstanding a release of escrowed funds that is authorized or required by this section, an escrow agent may refuse to release funds from an escrow account if the escrow agent, in its judgment, has sufficient cause to believe the certificate confirming substantial completion or determining the amount necessary for substantial completion is fraudulent or without factual basis.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Not earlier than 9 months after closing the sale of the first unit in a phase of a condominium project for which escrowed funds have been retained under subsection (3)(c) or for which security has been provided under subsection (5), an escrow agent, upon the request of the association or any interested co-owner, shall notify the developer of the amount of funds deposited under subsection (3)(c) or security provided under subsection (5) for such purpose that remains, and of the date determined under this subsection upon which those funds can be released. In the case of a recreational facility or other facility intended for general common use, not earlier than 9 months after the date on which the facility was promised in the condominium documents to be completed by the developer, an escrow agent, upon the request of the association or any interested co-owner, shall notify the developer of the amount of funds deposited under subsection (3)(d) or security provided under subsection (5) for such purpose that remains, and of the date determined under this subsection upon which those funds can be released. Three months after receipt of a request pertaining to funds described in subsection (3)(c) or (3)(d), funds that have not yet been released to the developer may be released by the escrow agent for the purpose of completing incomplete improvements for which the funds were originally retained, or for a purpose specified in a written agreement between the association and the developer entered into after the transitional control date. The agreement may specify that issues relating to the use of the funds be submitted to arbitration. The escrow agent may release funds in the manner provided in such an agreement or may initiate an interpleader action and deposit retained funds with a court of competent jurisdiction. In any interpleader action, the circuit court shall be empowered, in its discretion, to appoint a receiver to administer the application of the funds. Any notice or request provided for in this subsection shall be in writing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If interest is paid on the amounts escrowed under this act, that interest shall be released in the same manner as provided for release of funds in this section except that the parties may, by written agreement, provide that interest on funds refunded to a depositor upon withdrawal may be paid to the developer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   The escrow agent in the performance of its duties under this section shall be deemed an independent party not acting as the agent of the developer, any purchaser, co-owner, or other interested party. So long as the escrow agent relies upon any certificate, cost estimate, or determination made by a licensed professional engineer or architect, as described in this act, the escrow agent shall have no liability whatever to the developer or to any purchaser, co-owner, or other interested party for any error in such certificate, cost estimate, or determination, or for any act or omission by the escrow agent in reliance thereon. The escrow agent shall be relieved of all liability upon release, in accordance with this section, of all amounts deposited with it pursuant to this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   A licensed professional architect or engineer undertaking to make a certification under this section shall be held to the normal standard of care required of a member of that profession in determining substantial completion and the estimated cost of substantial completion under this act, but such architect or engineer shall not be required to have designed the improvement or item or to have inspected or to have otherwise exercised supervisory control thereof during the course of construction or installation of the improvement or item with respect to which the certificate is delivered. The certification by a licensed professional architect or engineer shall not be construed to limit the developer's liability for any defect in construction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   For purposes of this section, “licensed professional engineer or architect” means a member of those professions who satisfies all requirements of the laws of this state for the practice of the profession, and who is not an employee of the developer or of a firm in which the developer or an officer or director of the developer is a principal or holds 10% or more of the outstanding shares of that firm.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The tenant's lease is not affected by the taking of reservations for units in the proposed conversion condominium.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 108.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Sums assessed to a co-owner by the association of co-owners that are unpaid together with interest on such sums, collection and late charges, advances made by the association of co-owners for taxes or other liens to protect its lien, attorney fees, and fines in accordance with the condominium documents, constitute a lien upon the unit or units in the project owned by the co-owner at the time of the assessment before other liens except tax liens on the condominium unit in favor of any state or federal taxing authority and sums unpaid on a first mortgage of record, except that past due assessments that are evidenced by a notice of lien recorded as set forth in subsection (3) have priority over a first mortgage recorded subsequent to the recording of the notice of lien. The lien upon each condominium unit owned by the co-owner shall be in the amount assessed against the condominium unit, plus a proportionate share of the total of all other unpaid assessments attributable to condominium units no longer owned by the co-owner but which became due while the co-owner had title to the condominium units. The lien may be foreclosed by an action or by advertisement by the association of co-owners in the name of the condominium project on behalf of the other co-owners.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A foreclosure shall be in the same manner as a foreclosure under the laws relating to foreclosure of real estate mortgages by advertisement or judicial action except that to the extent the condominium documents provide, the association of co-owners is entitled to reasonable interest, expenses, costs, and attorney fees for foreclosure by advertisement or judicial action. The redemption period for a foreclosure is 6 months from the date of sale unless the property is abandoned, in which event the redemption period is 1 month from the date of sale.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A foreclosure proceeding may not be commenced without recordation and service of notice of lien in accordance with the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Notice of lien shall set forth all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The legal description of the condominium unit or condominium units to which the lien attaches.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   The name of the co-owner of record.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   The amounts due the association of co-owners at the date of the notice, exclusive of interest, costs, attorney fees, and future assessments.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The notice of lien shall be in recordable form, executed by an authorized representative of the association of co-owners and may contain other information that the association of co-owners considers appropriate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The notice of lien shall be recorded in the office of register of deeds in the county in which the condominium project is located and shall be served upon the delinquent co-owner by first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the last known address of the co-owner at least 10 days in advance of commencement of the foreclosure proceeding.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The association of co-owners, acting on behalf of all co-owners, unless prohibited by the master deed or bylaws, may bid in at the foreclosure sale, and acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, or convey the condominium unit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   An action to recover money judgments for unpaid assessments may be maintained without foreclosing or waiving the lien.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   An action for money damages and foreclosure may be combined in 1 action.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A receiver may be appointed in an action for foreclosure of the assessment lien and may be empowered to take possession of the condominium unit, if not occupied by the co-owner, and to lease the condominium unit and collect and apply the rental from the condominium unit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The co-owner of a condominium unit subject to foreclosure under this section, and any purchaser, grantee, successor, or assignee of the co-owner's interest in the condominium unit, is liable for assessments by the association of co-owners chargeable to the condominium unit that become due before expiration of the period of redemption together with interest, advances made by the association of co-owners for taxes or other liens to protect its lien, costs, and attorney fees incurred in their collection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   The mortgagee of a first mortgage of record of a condominium unit shall give notice to the association of co-owners of the commencement of foreclosure of the first mortgage by advertisement by serving a copy of the published notice of foreclosure required by statute upon the association of co-owners by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the resident agent of the association of co-owners at the agent's address as shown on the records of the Michigan corporation and securities bureau, or to the address the association provides to the mortgagee, if any, in those cases where the address is not registered, within 10 days after the first publication of the notice. The mortgagee of a first mortgage of record of a condominium unit shall give notice to the association of co-owners of intent to commence foreclosure of the first mortgage by judicial action by serving a notice setting forth the names of the mortgagors, the mortgagee, and the foreclosing assignee of a recorded assignment of the mortgage, if any; the date of the mortgage and the date the mortgage was recorded; the amount claimed to be due on the mortgage on the date of the notice; and a description of the mortgaged premises that substantially conforms with the description contained in the mortgage upon the association of co-owners by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the resident agent of the association of co-owners at the agent's address as shown on the records of the Michigan corporation and securities bureau, or to the address the association provides to the mortgagee, if any, in those cases where the address is not registered, not less than 10 days before commencement of the judicial action. Failure of the mortgagee to provide notice as required by this section shall only provide the association with legal recourse and will not, in any event, invalidate any foreclosure proceeding between a mortgagee and mortgagor.</DIV>

Unless the purchaser or grantee requests a written statement from the association of co-owners as provided in this act, at least 5 days before sale, the purchaser or grantee shall be liable for any unpaid assessments against the condominium unit together with interest, costs, fines, late charges, and attorney fees incurred in the collection thereof.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Before the transitional control date, during the development and sales period the rights of a co-owner, including the developer, to rent any number of condominium units shall be controlled by the provisions of the condominium documents as recorded by the developer and shall not be changed without developer approval. After the transitional control date, the association of co-owners may amend the condominium documents as to the rental of condominium units or terms of occupancy. The amendment shall not affect the rights of any lessors or lessees under a written lease otherwise in compliance with this section and executed before the effective date of the amendment, or condominium units that are owned or leased by the developer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A co-owner, including the developer, desiring to rent or lease a condominium unit shall disclose that fact in writing to the association of co-owners at least 10 days before presenting a lease or otherwise agreeing to grant possession of a condominium unit to potential lessees or occupants and, at the same time, shall supply the association of co-owners with a copy of the exact lease for its review for its compliance with the condominium documents. The co-owner or developer shall also provide the association of co-owners with a copy of the executed lease. If no lease is to be used, then the co-owner or developer shall supply the association of co-owners with the name and address of the lessees or occupants, along with the rental amount and due dates of any rental or compensation payable to a co-owner or developer, the due dates of that rental and compensation, and the term of the proposed arrangement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Tenants or nonco-owner occupants shall comply with all of the conditions of the condominium documents of the condominium project, and all leases and rental agreements shall so state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the association of co-owners determines that the tenant or nonco-owner occupant failed to comply with the conditions of the condominium documents, the association of co-owners shall take the following action:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The association of co-owners shall notify the co-owner by certified mail, advising of the alleged violation by the tenant. The co-owner shall have 15 days after receipt of the notice to investigate and correct the alleged breach by the tenant or advise the association of co-owners that a violation has not occurred.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If after 15 days the association of co-owners believes that the alleged breach is not cured or may be repeated, it may institute on its behalf or derivatively by the co-owners on behalf of the association of co-owners, if it is under the control of the developer, an action for both eviction against the tenant or nonco-owner occupant and, simultaneously, for money damages against the co-owner and tenant or nonco-owner occupant for breach of the conditions of the condominium documents. The relief provided for in this section may be by summary proceeding. The association of co-owners may hold both the tenant and the co-owner liable for any damages to the general common elements caused by the co-owner or tenant in connection with the condominium unit or condominium project.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   When a co-owner is in arrearage to the association of co-owners for assessments, the association of co-owners may give written notice of the arrearage to a tenant occupying a co-owner's condominium unit under a lease or rental agreement, and the tenant, after receiving the notice, shall deduct from rental payments due the co-owner the arrearage and future assessments as they fall due and pay them to the association of co-owners. The deduction does not constitute a breach of the rental agreement or lease by the tenant. If the tenant, after being notified, fails or refuses to remit rent otherwise due the co-owner to the association of co-owners, then the association of co-owners may do the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Issue a statutory notice to quit for non-payment of rent to the tenant and shall have the right to enforce that notice by summary proceeding.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Initiate proceedings pursuant to subsection (4)(b).</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Special assessments and property taxes shall be assessed against the individual condominium units identified as units of the condominium subdivision plan and not on the total property of the project or any other part of the project, except for the year in which the condominium project was established subsequent to the tax day. Taxes and special assessments which become a lien against the property in that year subsequent to the establishment of the condominium project shall be expenses of administration of the project and paid by the co-owners as provided in section 69. The taxes and special assessments shall not be divided or apportioned on the tax roll any provision of any law to the contrary notwithstanding.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Special assessments and property taxes in any year in which the property existed as an established condominium project on the tax day shall be assessed against the individual condominium unit, notwithstanding any subsequent vacation of the condominium project. Condominium units shall be described for such purposes by reference to the condominium unit number of the condominium subdivision plan and the caption of the plan together with the liber and page of the county records in which the approved master deed is recorded. Assessments for subsequent real property improvements to a specific condominium unit shall be assessed to that condominium unit description only. For property tax and special assessment purposes, each condominium unit shall be treated as a separate single unit of real property and shall not be combined with any other unit or units and no assessment of any fraction of any unit or combination of any unit with other units or fractions of any unit shall be made, nor shall any division or split of the assessment or taxes of any single condominium unit be made notwithstanding separate or common ownership of the unit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A restricted unit as defined in section 104b shall be exempt from any increase in ad valorem taxes on real property attributable to an increase in the true cash value of the restricted unit that is due to the conversion condominium project in which the restricted unit is located. For purposes of applying this exemption, the total assessment of a restricted unit shall not exceed the total assessment for the tax year preceding the tax year in which the master deed for the property constituting the conversion condominium project was recorded, multiplied by the percentage of value of the restricted unit. The exemption provided in this subsection shall terminate for the tax year following the termination of tenancy in the restricted unit. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    If any portion of the common elements is taken by eminent domain, the award therefor shall be allocated to the co-owners in proportion to their respective undivided interests in the common elements. The association of co-owners, acting through its board of directors, may negotiate on behalf of all co-owners for any taking of common elements and any negotiated settlement approved by more than 2/3 of co-owners based upon assigned voting rights shall be binding on all co-owners.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a condominium unit is taken by eminent domain, the undivided interest in the common elements appertaining to the condominium unit shall thenceforth appertain to the remaining condominium units, being allocated to them in proportion to their respective undivided interests in the common elements. The court shall enter a decree reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests produced thereby, and the award shall include, without limitation, just compensation to the co-owner of the condominium unit taken for his undivided interest in the common elements as well as for the condominium unit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If portions of a condominium unit are taken by eminent domain, the court shall determine the fair market value of the portions of the condominium unit not taken. The undivided interest for each condominium unit in the common elements appertaining to the condominium units shall be reduced in proportion to the diminution in the fair market value of the condominium unit resulting from the taking. The portions of undivided interest in the common elements thereby divested from the co-owners of a condominium unit shall be reallocated among the other condominium units in the condominium project in proportion to their respective undivided interests in the common elements. A condominium unit partially taken shall receive the reallocation in proportion to its undivided interest as reduced by the court under this subsection. The court shall enter a decree reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests produced thereby, and the award shall include just compensation to the co-owner of the condominium unit partially taken for that portion of the undivided interest in the common elements divested from the co-owner and not revested in the co-owner pursuant to subsection (4), as well as for that portion of the condominium unit taken by eminent domain.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the taking of a portion of a condominium unit makes it impractical to use the remaining portion of that condominium unit for a lawful purpose permitted by the condominium documents, then the entire undivided interest in the common elements appertaining to that condominium unit shall thenceforth appertain to the remaining condominium units, being allocated to them in proportion to their respective undivided interests in the common elements. The remaining portion of that condominium unit shall thenceforth be a common element. The court shall enter an order reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests produced thereby, and the award shall include just compensation to the co-owner of the condominium unit for the co-owner's entire undivided interest in the common elements and for the entire condominium unit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Votes in the association of co-owners and liability for future expenses of administration appertaining to a condominium unit taken or partially taken by eminent domain shall thenceforth appertain to the remaining condominium units, being allocated to them in proportion to the relative voting strength in the association of co-owners. A condominium unit partially taken shall receive a reallocation as though the voting strength in the association of co-owners was reduced in proportion to the reduction in the undivided interests in the common elements. </DIV>

<P>Sec. 135.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   As used in this section, “successor developer” means a person who acquires title to the lesser of 10 units or 75% of the units in a condominium project, other than a business condominium project, by foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure, purchase, or similar transaction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A successor developer shall do both of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Comply with this act in the same manner as a developer before selling any units.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Except as provided in subsection (3), assume all express written contractual warranty obligations for defects in workmanship and materials undertaken by its predecessor in title. A successor developer shall not be required to assume, and shall not otherwise be liable for, any other contractual obligations of its predecessor in title.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A successor developer shall not be required to comply with subsection (2)(b) with respect to any express written contractual warranty obligations for defects in workmanship and materials, if either of the following is maintained with respect to units for which such a warranty was undertaken by the predecessor in title:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   An insurance policy, in a form approved by the insurance bureau, that is underwritten by an insurer authorized to do business in this state. The insurance policy shall provide coverage for express written contractual warranty obligations for liability for defects in workmanship and materials.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   An aggregate escrow account with an escrow agent which contains not less than 0.5% of the sales price of each unit. If the escrow account described in this subdivision is initiated by a developer before a successor developer acquires title, 0.5% of the sales price of each unit in the project shall be deposited by the developer in the aggregate escrow account periodically upon the sale of each unit. If the escrow account described in this subdivision is initiated by a successor developer after acquisition of title, a total amount equal to 0.5% of the sales price of all units for which the warranty period plus 6 months has not expired shall be deposited by the successor developer in the aggregate escrow account, and 0.5% of the sales price of each unit shall be deposited by the successor developer in the aggregate escrow account periodically upon the sale of each remaining unit. Funds in an escrow account described in this subdivision shall not be released for a unit until 6 months after the expiration of the warranty period for that unit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A successor developer that acquires title to the lesser of 10 business condominium units or 75% of the business condominium units in the condominium project shall not be required to assume, and shall not otherwise be liable for, any contractual obligations of its predecessor in title.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A residential builder who neither constructs nor refurbishes common elements in a condominium project and who is not an affiliate of the developer shall not be required to assume and be liable for any contractual obligations of the developer under this section, and shall not be considered a successor developer or acquire any additional developer obligations or rights in the absence of a specific assignment of those obligations or rights from the developer. However, a residential builder that sells a condominium unit shall deliver to the purchaser of that condominium unit the condominium documents that the developer is required to deliver to the purchasers under section 84a(1). This subsection applies only to condominium projects established on or after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 173.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    This act applies to a condominium project or condominium unit as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   For a condominium project for which a permit to sell has been issued on or before March 18, 1983, the developer may elect to comply with 1 or more of the following requirements in lieu of the specified provisions:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   In lieu of section 31, 32, 33, 52, or 66, or any combination of these sections, the developer may elect to comply with the terms of the master deed in effect as of March 18, 1983.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   In lieu of sections 66(2)(j), 66(4), 84(3), 84(4)(a), (c), and (e), and 103b, the developer may elect to deposit all funds paid by a purchaser on or after January 17, 1983 into an escrow account pursuant to an escrow agreement the terms of which were approved by the administrator on or before March 18, 1983. The funds escrowed under this subdivision in excess of any amount or percentage of the escrowed funds that had been required to be escrowed by the administrator or a condominium document pursuant to former section 103 to cover the cost of construction of recreational facilities and other common elements, shall be released only upon conveyance of the condominium unit to that purchaser and issuance of a certificate of occupancy if required by local ordinance. Appropriate funds retained in escrow to cover the cost of construction of recreational facilities and other common elements shall be released to the developer upon completion of each recreational facility or other common element. The escrow agent shall be a bank, savings and loan association, or title insurance company, or person designated to act as the agent of a title insurance company, licensed or authorized to do business in this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   For a condominium project for which a permit to sell has been issued on or before March 18, 1983, the developer may elect to exempt the project from the application of sections 84(4)(d), 144, and 145(b).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   For promotional material filed with the administrator on or before March 18, 1983, the developer may elect to exempt the promotional material from the application of section 81a. For promotional material that has not been filed with the administrator on or before March 18, 1983 and that relates to a condominium project to which section 66 does not apply, the developer shall comply with section 81a as if section 66 was applicable to the condominium project.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Sections 104a, 104b, and 104d and former section 104c apply to all condominium projects that on October 10, 1980 complied with the definition of qualified conversion condominium project provided in section 104b.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Subsection (1)(a)(ii) and (b) does not apply to any phase or convertible area of a condominium project if the phase is established or the convertibility option is exercised after March 18, 1983 and that establishment or exercise results in the addition of units to the condominium project or the creation of a facility intended for common use.</DIV>
