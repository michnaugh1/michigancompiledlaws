<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>As used in this act:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Property" means any legal or equitable interest in real or personal property, including choses in action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Power" means a power of appointment over property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Power of appointment" means a power created or reserved by a person having property subject to his or her disposition that enables the donee of the power to designate, within any limits that may be prescribed, the transferees of the property or the shares or the interests in which it shall be received. The term power of appointment may include a power of amendment or revocation, but does not include a power of sale or a power of attorney. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Donor" means a person who creates or reserves a power.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) "Donee" means a person to whom a power is granted or reserved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) "Appointee" means a person to whom a beneficial interest in property is designated or transferred by exercise of a power or, if a power is exercised in favor of a trustee, a person for whose benefit property has been designated or transferred in trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) "Creating instrument" means a deed, will, trust agreement, or other writing or document that creates or reserves a power.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) "General power" means a power, the permissible appointees of which include the donee, his or her estate, his or her creditors, or the creditors of his or her estate. The term general power includes a power that is not expressly restricted as to appointees. A power may be general as to some property and special as to other property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) "Special power" means a power, the permissible appointees of which do not include the donee, his or her estate, his or her creditors, or the creditors of his or her estate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) "Gift in default" means a transfer to a person designated in the creating instrument as the transferee of property if a power is not exercised or is released.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) "Release" means renunciation, relinquishment, surrender, refusal to accept, and any other form of release.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) A power of appointment is "presently" exercisable whenever the creating instrument does not manifest an intent that its exercise shall be solely by will or otherwise postponed.</div>

A power holder's lack of capacity to exercise a power of revocation negates the power of revocation unless an agent of the power holder under a durable power of attorney, a conservator of the power holder, or a plenary guardian of the power holder is serving and the agent, conservator, or guardian is authorized to exercise the power of revocation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(q) "Trustee" means a fiduciary or set of co-fiduciaries as described in section 2901(2)(j) of EPIC, MCL 700.2901.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A power may be created by any creating instrument which is executed in the manner required by law for that instrument.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Unless otherwise provided in the creating instrument, an instrument manifests an intent to exercise the power if the instrument purports to transfer an interest in the appointive property that the donee would have no power to transfer except by virtue of the power, even though the power is not recited or referred to in the instrument, or if the instrument either expressly or by necessary implication from its wording, interpreted in the light of the circumstances surrounding its drafting and execution, manifests an intent to exercise the power. Subject to the other provisions of this section, if there is a general power exercisable by will with no express gift in default in the creating instrument, a residuary clause or other general language in the donee's will purporting to dispose of all of the donee's estate or property operates to exercise the power, but in all other cases such a clause or language does not in itself manifest an intent to exercise a power exercisable by will.</DIV>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>556.115 Methods by which powers may be exercised by donees.</B><P>Sec. 5.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A power may be exercised by any donee capable of transferring the interest in property to which the power relates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A power may be exercised only by a written instrument that would be sufficient to pass the interest intended to be appointed if the donee were the owner of the interest. Unless otherwise contemplated in the creating instrument, a power may be exercised only by a written instrument that complies with the requirements, if any, of the creating instrument as to the manner, time, and conditions of the exercise of the power, except that a power exercisable only by deed is also exercisable by a written will executed as required by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the donor has authorized the power to be exercised by an instrument not sufficient in law to pass the appointive interest, the power is not void, but may be exercised by an instrument conforming to subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If consent of the donor or of any other person is required for the exercise of a power, the consent must be expressed in the instrument exercising the power or in a separate written instrument, signed in either case by the person whose consent is required. If any person whose consent is required dies or becomes legally incapable of consenting, the power may be exercised by the donee without the consent of that person unless the creating instrument, construed with regard to surrounding circumstances, manifests a contrary intent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) When a power is vested in 2 or more persons, all must unite in its exercise; but if 1 or more of the donees dies, becomes incapable of exercising the power, or releases the power, the power may be exercised by the others, unless the creating instrument, construed with regard to surrounding circumstances, manifests a contrary intent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) When a power is vested in 2 or more trustees, the trustees' coordination in the exercise of the power is governed by sections 7703 and 7815(3) of the MTC, MCL 700.7703 and 700.7815, unless the trust instrument manifests a contrary intent.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>556.115a Second trust.</B><P>Sec. 5a.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A trustee with a presently exercisable discretionary power to make distributions of income or principal of an irrevocable trust to or for the benefit of 1 or more beneficiaries of the trust may, unless the terms of the first trust expressly provide otherwise, exercise the power by appointing all or part of the property subject to the power in favor of the trustee of a second trust, provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Except as provided in subsection (2), the beneficiaries of the second trust include only permissible appointees, even if fewer than all permissible appointees, of the trustee's discretionary distribution power as of the time the power is exercised.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For a trust, contributions to which have been excluded from gift tax under section 2503(c) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 2503(c), the trust instrument of the second trust provides that the beneficiary's remainder interest will pass or be payable no later than the date on which the interest would have passed or been payable under the terms of the first trust instrument.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The exercise of the discretionary power does not reduce the income, annuity, or unitrust interest or general power of appointment of a beneficiary of a trust that was intended to qualify for a marital or charitable deduction under federal or state law by virtue of that beneficiary's interest in the trust, whether or not that deduction is actually taken.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The exercise of the discretionary power does not reduce a presently exercisable general power to withdraw a specified percentage or amount of trust property in a trust beneficiary who is the only trust beneficiary to or for the benefit of whom the trustee has the power to make discretionary distributions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The second trust instrument may provide 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A special or general power of appointment, including a power to appoint trust property to persons who are not beneficiaries of the first trust, to 1 or more of the beneficiaries of the second trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That at a time or upon the occurrence of an event specified in the second trust instrument, the remaining trust assets shall thereafter be held for the benefit of beneficiaries who are or who would have been beneficiaries of the first trust on terms and conditions substantially identical, with respect to the interests of those beneficiaries, to the terms and conditions of the first trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) That assets of the first trust discovered after exercise of the power described in subsection (1) shall be property of the first trust if that trust continues in existence after exercise of the power, or that assets of the first trust discovered after exercise of the power shall be property of the second trust if the first trust terminates upon exercise of the power.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) For indemnification of the trustee of the first trust, except as limited by section 7908 of the MTC, MCL 700.7908.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For purposes of this section, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A discretionary power to make distributions to a given trust beneficiary is presently exercisable when the timeliness of a present distribution to or for the benefit of that beneficiary depends, under the terms of the trust instrument, only on the trustee's judgment as to what is in the beneficiary's best interests.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A power to make distributions is not discretionary if it is limited by a definite and ascertainable standard, but instructions for the trustee to consider such things as a beneficiary's best interests, welfare, comfort, happiness, or general development do not in themselves constitute definite and ascertainable standards, regardless of whether the trustee is also instructed or permitted to consider resources outside the trust that may be available to the beneficiary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A general power annually to withdraw a specified percentage or amount of trust property is presently exercisable with respect to any year for which the beneficiary who holds the power is entitled, under the terms of the governing instrument, to exercise the power, and each subsequent year for which the beneficiary will be entitled to exercise the power assuming only the beneficiary's survival and the continuation of the trust. For example, if a trust provides that, beginning in the fifth year after the trust becomes irrevocable, the beneficiary shall have the power for the remainder of his or her life annually to withdraw $5,000.00 or 5% of the value of the trust principal, whichever is greater, then, in the fourth year after the trust becomes irrevocable, the beneficiary's power to make annual withdrawals is not presently exercisable; however, in the fifth year after the trust becomes irrevocable, the beneficiary's power is presently exercisable, for purposes of this section, with respect to the fifth year and each subsequent year during the beneficiary's life.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The trustee of the second trust may be the trustee of the first trust, the second trust may be a trust under the governing instrument of the first trust or another governing instrument, the governing instrument may be one created by the trustee of the first trust, and the governing instrument may be the instrument that exercises the power described in subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A second trust shall be treated as both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A new irrevocable trust for purposes of the notice requirements of section 7814(2)(c) of the MTC, MCL 700.7814.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A continuation of the first trust for purposes of the notice requirements of section 7814(2)(d) of the MTC, MCL 700.7814, and the charge of any fee or commission on the transfer of assets from the first trust to the second trust shall be treated as a change in the rate of the trustee's compensation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A discretionary power under subsection (1) is a power of appointment and a discretionary power for purposes of section 7815 of the MTC, MCL 700.7815.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) This section shall not abridge the right of a trustee who has a power to distribute trust property in further trust under this act, any other statute, or the common law. This section shall not abridge the right of a trustee who has a power to amend or revoke a trust.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) It is the intent of the legislature that this section be a codification of the common law of this state in effect before the effective date of the amendatory act that added this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) As used in this section, "first trust" means an irrevocable trust over which a trustee has a presently exercisable discretionary power to make distributions that is exercised as described in subsection (1).</div>

<P>Sec. 6.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the will of a donee of a general power exercisable by will either effectively exercises the power or manifests an intent to exercise the power and satisfies the requirements of sections 4 and 5, all interests which the donee could by will appoint and which the donee's will appoints or purports to appoint shall be regarded as part of the donee's estate for the following purposes only:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The payment of the expenses of administration of the donee's estate, to the extent that the donee's individual assets are insufficient for that purpose.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The satisfaction of the claims of the donee's creditors, to the extent provided in section 13.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Inclusion of such interests in determining the right of election of the donee's widow and the satisfaction of such right.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The distribution of any of such interests as the intestate property of the donee, to the extent that the donee's will does not effectively dispose of such interests and the creating instrument does not otherwise provide.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Unless the creating instrument expressly provides that a power cannot be released or expressly restricts the time, manner or scope of release, all powers may be released except as provided in subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Unless the creating instrument expressly provides otherwise, a special power may not be released if either the power is not presently exercisable, or the power is exercisable by a trustee or other fiduciary in a fiduciary capacity which requires the exercise of the power.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The release of a power may include all or any part of the property subject to the power; reduce or limit the persons or objects, or classes of persons or objects in whose favor the power is exercisable; or limit in any other respect the extent to or the manner in which the power may be exercised.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A release may be effected, either with or without consideration, by written instrument signed by the donee and delivered.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Delivery of a release may be accomplished in any of the following ways, but this subsection does not preclude a determination that a release has been delivered in some other manner:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Delivery to any person specified in the creating instrument.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Delivery to a trustee or other fiduciary or to 1 of several trustees or other fiduciaries, other than the donee, of the property to which the power relates, or by filing with the court having jurisdiction over the trust.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Delivery to any person, other than the donee, who could be adversely affected by an exercise of the power.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   By recording or filing in the office of the register of deeds in the county where the property is located or where the donee resides, which release shall be recorded by the register.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a donee has a general power of appointment, any interest that the donee has power to appoint or has appointed is to be treated as property of the donee for the purposes of satisfying claims of the donee's creditors, as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a donee has an unexercised general power of appointment and the donee can presently exercise such a power, any creditor of the donee may by appropriate proceedings reach any interest that the donee could appoint, to the extent that the donee's individual assets are insufficient to satisfy the creditor's claim. If the donee has exercised the power, the creditor can reach the appointed interests to the same extent that under the law relating to fraudulent conveyances the creditor could reach property that the donee has owned and transferred.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Under a general assignment by a donee for the benefit of the donee's creditors, the assignee may exercise any right that a creditor of the donee would have under subsection (2).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A principal may designate 2 or more persons to act as coagents. Unless the power of attorney otherwise provides, each coagent may exercise the authority granted in the power independently.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A principal may designate 1 or more successor agents to act if an agent resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated, is not qualified to serve, or declines to serve. A principal may grant authority to designate 1 or more successor agents to an agent or other person designated by name, office, or function. Unless the power of attorney otherwise provides, a successor agent has the same authority as that granted to the original agent and shall not act until all of the successor agent's predecessors under the terms of the power of attorney have resigned, died, become incapacitated, are no longer qualified to serve, or have declined to serve.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Act in accordance with reasonable expectations of the principal that are actually known to the agent and, to the extent the expectations are not actually known, act in the principal's best interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Act in good faith.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Act only within the scope of authority granted by the principal.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Act loyally for the principal's benefit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Act so as not to create a conflict of interest that impairs the agent's ability to act impartially in the principal's best interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Act with the care, competence, and diligence that a prudent person would in dealing with the property of another.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Cooperate with a person that has authority to make health care decisions for the principal to carry out reasonable expectations of the principal concerning health care that are actually known to the agent and, to the extent the expectations are not actually known, to act in the principal's best interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Attempt to preserve the principal's estate plan to the extent that plan is actually known to the agent and preserving the plan is consistent with the principal's best interest based on relevant factors including all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The value and nature of the principal's property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The principal's foreseeable obligations and need for maintenance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The desirability of minimizing taxes, including income, estate, inheritance, generation-skipping transfer, and gift taxes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Eligibility for a benefit, a program, or assistance under a statute or regulation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An agent who acts in good faith is not liable to any beneficiary of the principal's estate plan for failure to preserve the plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An agent who acts for the best interest of the principal with the care, competence, and diligence that a prudent person would in dealing with the property of another is not liable solely because the agent also benefits from the act or has an individual or conflicting interest in relation to the property or affairs of the principal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If an agent is selected by the principal because of special skills or expertise possessed by the agent or in reliance on the agent's representation that the agent has special skills or expertise, the special skills or expertise must be considered in determining whether the agent has acted with care, competence, and diligence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A decline in the value of the principal's property is not in itself sufficient to establish a breach of fiduciary duty.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An agent serving under a power of attorney that does not have knowledge of a breach or imminent breach of fiduciary duty by another agent who is or was serving under that power does not have a duty to investigate the conduct of any coagent or predecessor agent to rule out the possibility of any breach.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) An agent who exercises authority to delegate to another person the authority granted by the principal or who engages another person on behalf of the principal is not liable for an act, error of judgment, or default of the person if the agent exercises care, competence, and diligence in selecting and monitoring the person.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney, an agent is not required to disclose receipts, disbursements, or transactions conducted on behalf of the principal unless ordered by a court or requested by the principal, a guardian, a conservator, another fiduciary acting for the principal, or adult protective services, or, on the death of the principal, by the personal representative or successor in interest of the principal's estate. If a person that is authorized by the power of attorney or by this subsection to request a disclosure described in this subsection makes a request, the agent shall comply with the request within 30 days or provide a record substantiating why additional time is needed. If additional time is needed, the agent shall comply with the request within an additional 30 days.</div>
