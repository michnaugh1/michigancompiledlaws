Said commissioners, after making a personal examination of such canal or improvement, shall fix and establish the rate of tolls and charges for each boat, vessel, raft, or craft of any description using such canal, or passing through said improved river, or any of the works of said company, and upon the goods, merchandise, or other cargo, on said boat or vessel, which said tolls or charges shall be a lien upon the boat or vessel using any of the improvements of said company, or having such goods or merchandise on board, and may be collected under the provisions of an act entitled “An act to repeal chapter 122 of the Revised Statutes of 1846, and the amendments thereto, and provide for the collection of demands against water-craft,” approved February 5, in the year of our Lord 1864, and shall be collected in the distribution of funds, as provided by section 33 of said act, under the fourth specification of said section; and it shall be the duty of the master or clerk of any such boat or vessel, on demand of the collector, or any other person authorized by said company to receive or collect such tolls or charges, to give such collector, or other person so authorized, a true and correct statement of all goods, merchandise, or other cargo, on said boat or vessel, and subject to pay any toll, or charges, which statement shall be verified by the oath of the master, or clerk of such vessel or boat. Said board of commissioners shall deliver a certified copy of such rates of tolls or charges to said company, a printed copy of which shall always be posted up at such place where toll is demanded, and the board shall file another copy with the secretary of state, which shall be duly recorded in his office.

<P>Sec. 22.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Any such corporation claiming any lien may bring an action of assumpsit against the owner of such property to determine and satisfy the amount of such lien or such corporation may waive its claim of lien and bring such action against such owner for the amount thereof. The proceedings in such actions shall be in accordance with the practice of the courts in which such action is commenced in actions of assumpsit. The property held under a claim of lien may be levied upon and sold to satisfy any judgment which may be rendered against such owner in such action, and the taxable costs in such case shall include the cost and expense of providing for the care and safety of such property. In cases where the claim of lien is waived under the provisions of this section the plaintiff shall have judgment if he shall establish on the trial such a state of facts as would have entitled him to a lien, and the judgment shall be collected as in ordinary cases in assumpsit: Provided, That such action shall be commenced within 60 days after such tolls shall become due.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If the owner of such logs, timber or other floatables, cannot be ascertained, or is without the jurisdiction of the court, the proceeding to ascertain and determine the amount of such lien may be against the property, and commenced by filing the petition of said corporation, claiming such lien, in the proper court, which shall contain a statement of the nature and amount of the claim, and a description of the property seized, and that the owner of such property is unknown, or is without the jurisdiction of the court, and praying for a judgment against such property for the amount of such claim, which petition shall be verified by the oath of the president of such corporation filing the same, or its agent or attorney. The plaintiff shall thereupon, and before any trial shall be had, or judgment rendered, in such proceeding, cause a notice to be published for 4 successive weeks, at least once in each week, in some newspaper printed and circulated in such county, or if none is printed and circulated in such county, then in such other newspaper published in this state as such court shall direct, which notice shall state the title of the court, the name of the plaintiff, the name of the owner of the property taken, if known, the nature and amount of the claim, and the description of the property upon which the lien is sought to be enforced. The owner of such property shall have a right to appear and defend in such proceedings, at any time before judgment, upon such terms as the court shall direct; and in case of his appearance, an issue shall thereupon be formed as in actions of assumpsit, and all subsequent proceedings in such case shall be in accordance with the practice of such court in actions of assumpsit. If the owner shall fail to appear in such proceeding, the court may proceed ex parte, to hear, try and determine the facts alleged in such petition, and render such judgment thereon as justice may require. If judgment shall be rendered in favor of such plaintiff, the court shall thereupon order that the property covered by such lien, or as much thereof as may be necessary, be sold to satisfy the amount of such judgment, with costs.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Any such corporation formed for the improvement of any boundary river in whole or part and any of its tributaries, and for driving, sorting, holding and delivering logs thereon, which shall have taken prior possession of such boundary river for that purpose, shall have power to improve such river and its tributaries by clearing and straightening the channels thereof, closing sloughs, erecting sluiceways, booms of all kinds, side rolling and flooding dams, driving piles and erecting piers or otherwise, as may be necessary or suitable for the purpose aforesaid: Provided, That such sluiceways, booms, dams, piles and piers shall, so far as practicable, be so constructed and used as to allow of the free passage of logs, timber and other floatables along such waters. Every corporation which shall so improve a boundary river or any of its tributaries for the purpose of driving logs thereon, and keep in repair and operate its works, may charge and collect reasonable and uniform tolls upon all logs, lumber and timber driven or floated on the same, and may take possession of all logs put into said stream, or upon rollways so as to impede the drive, when the owners thereof or their agents shall not have come upon the stream adequately provided with men, teams and tools for breaking rollways and driving such logs in season for making a through drive down such stream without hindering the main drive, and shall also, at the request of the owner of any logs and timber put into said stream, take charge of the same and drive the same down and out of such stream, and charge and collect therefor of the owner or party controlling said logs and timber reasonable charges and expenses for such services, (and all charges for running, driving, booming, towing, rafting, sorting and delivering of logs, timber or lumber by such corporation shall be by the scale of such logs, timber or lumber per 1,000 feet board measure); and such corporation shall for all such tolls, costs and expenses, have a lien on the logs for which the same were incurred, and shall be entitled to maintain possession of such logs or timber, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the amount of such tolls, costs and all expenses for taking care of the same until the same shall be determined, satisfied and paid in the manner hereinafter prescribed.</DIV>
