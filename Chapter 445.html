<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A person shall not carry on, conduct, or transact business in this state under an assumed name, or under a designation, name, or style other than the real name of the person owning, conducting, or transacting that business, unless the person files in duplicate in the office of the clerk of the county or counties in which the person owns, conducts, or transacts, or intends to own, conduct, or transact, business, or maintains an office or place of business, a certificate on a form furnished by the county clerk setting forth the name under which the business owned is, or is to be, conducted or transacted, and the true or real full name and address of the person owning, conducting, or transacting the business.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The selling of goods by sample or through a traveling agent or traveling salesperson, or by means of orders forwarded by the purchaser through the mails, shall not be construed for the purpose of this act as conducting or transacting business so as to require the filing of the certificates.</DIV>

Between the sixtieth and thirtieth day before the expiration date of an outstanding certificate, the county clerk shall mail to the person or persons whose certificate will expire renewal certificate blank forms, in duplicate, together with a notice, on form to be provided by the clerk, that the certificate authorizing .......... and .......... to conduct business under the assumed name of ......... expires at 5 p.m. on the ..... day of .........., and that failure to file a renewal certificate and pay a fee of $4.00 before the expiration date shall on that date constitute abandonment of the assumed name.

Six years after an original or renewal certificate has expired, the county clerk may destroy the certificate.</DIV>

If personal service of the notice and copy of summons is had upon the defendant, the officer making the service shall so state in the affidavit of service which shall be filed with the court having jurisdiction of the cause, or if service be made by certified mail, then the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney shall make an affidavit showing that service of the notice and summons has been made upon the defendant by certified mail and the affiant shall attach to the affidavit a true copy of the summons and notice served and the return receipt of the defendant and shall file the affidavit and attached papers with the court having jurisdiction of the cause. The court in which the action is pending may order an extension of time necessary to afford the defendant reasonable opportunity to defend the action.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The circuit court of the county in the office of the county clerk of which the certificate is filed shall have jurisdiction of an action brought against the nonresident person, but this provision shall not be construed as depriving any other court of jurisdiction.</DIV>

If the property is seized without process as provided under section 19a and the total value of the property seized does not exceed $50,000.00, the following procedure shall be used:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The local unit of government that seized the property or, if the property was seized by the state, the state shall notify the owner of the property that the property has been seized and that the local unit of government or, if applicable, the state intends to forfeit and dispose of the property by delivering a written notice to the owner of the property or by sending the notice to the owner by certified mail. If the name and address of the owner are not reasonably ascertainable or delivery of the notice cannot be reasonably accomplished, the notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the property was seized, for 10 successive publishing days.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Unless all criminal proceedings involving or relating to the property have been completed, the seizing agency shall immediately notify the prosecuting attorney for the county in which the property was seized or, if the attorney general is actively handling a case involving or relating to the property, the attorney general of the seizure of the property and the intention to forfeit and dispose of the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Any person claiming an interest in property that is the subject of a notice under subdivision (a) may, within 20 days after receipt of the notice or of the date of the first publication of the notice, file a written claim signed by the claimant with the local unit of government or the state expressing his or her interest in the property.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If no claim is filed or bond given within the 20-day period as described in subdivision (c), the local unit of government or the state shall declare the property forfeited and shall dispose of the property as provided under section 19c. However, unless all criminal proceedings involving or relating to the property have been completed, the local unit of government or the state shall not dispose of the property under this subdivision without the written consent of the prosecuting attorney or, if the attorney general is actively handling a case involving or relating to the property, the attorney general.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Property taken or detained under this act is not subject to an action to recover personal property, but is considered to be in the custody of the seizing agency subject only to this section or an order and judgment of the court having jurisdiction over the forfeiture proceedings. When property is seized under this act, the seizing agency may do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Place the property under seal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Remove the property to a place designated by the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Take custody of the property and remove it to an appropriate location for disposition in accordance with law.</div>

A forfeiture of real property encumbered by a bona fide security interest is subject to the interest of the secured party who neither had knowledge of nor consented to the act or omission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An attorney for a person who is charged with a crime involving or related to the money seized under this act has 60 days within which to examine that money. This 60-day period begins to run after notice is given under subsection (1)(a) but before the money is deposited into a financial institution under subsection (2)(d). If the attorney general, prosecuting attorney, or city or township attorney fails to sustain his or her burden of proof in forfeiture proceedings under this act, the court shall order the return of the money, including any interest earned on money deposited into a financial institution under subsection (2)(d).</div>

<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The legislature of the state of Michigan hereby finds: improper and misleading uses of the words "wholesale,""employee" and similar terms or phrases in connection with certain sales; and likewise improper and misleading uses of the words "manufacturer,""broker,""wholesaler," and similar terms or phrases denoting that the seller of a product is something other than a retailer thereof; and likewise the other practices hereinafter prohibited, are harmful to the welfare of the people of this state in the following ways, among others: consumers are misled into believing they are buying goods at a substantial discount from regular retail prices, when in fact they are not; trade is diverted from established retail outlets offering various customer services (such as free deliveries, exchange privileges, and credit facilities) to establishments not offering equal services but selling at substantially the same price, to the detriment of the consumer, who is deprived of the benefit of such services without receiving compensating advantages; purchases by business concerns, at discounts from current retail market prices, of goods, wares, and merchandise purchased not for business use but for the personal use of individuals, divert trade unfairly from established retail outlets, resulting in a loss of sales tax revenues and in a trend to higher retail prices. The legislature, acting in the exercise of the police power of the state, declares that the public policy of the state requires, and that the general welfare of the people of the state will be benefited by, the suppression of the trade practices hereinafter defined.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The commission shall publish the do-not-call list quarterly for use by telephone solicitors.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   The do-not-call list fund is created in the state treasury. Money received from fees under subparagraph (iii) shall be credited to the fund. The state treasurer shall direct the investment of the fund. The state treasurer shall credit to the fund interest and earnings from fund investments. Money remaining in the fund at the end of a fiscal year shall be carried over in the fund to the next and succeeding fiscal years. Money in the fund may be appropriated to the commission to cover the costs of administering the do-not-call list, but may not be appropriated to compensate or reimburse a vendor designated under subdivision (b) to maintain a do-not-call list under that subdivision.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   The commission shall establish and collect 1 or both of the following fees to cover the costs to the commission for administering the do-not-call list:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(B)   Fees charged by the vendor to residential telephone subscribers for inclusion on the do-not-call list. A designated vendor shall not charge a residential telephone subscriber a fee of more than $5.00 for a 3-year period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii)   The designee do-not-call list fund is created in the state treasury. If the vendor is a department or agency of this state, money received from fees under subparagraph (vii) by that vendor shall be credited to the fund. The state treasurer shall direct the investment of the fund. The state treasurer shall credit to the fund interest and earnings from fund investments. Money remaining in the fund at the end of a fiscal year shall be carried over in the fund to the next and succeeding fiscal years. Money in the fund may be appropriated to that vendor to cover the costs of administering the do-not-call list.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In determining whether to establish a state do-not-call list under subsection (2)(a) or designate a vendor under subsection (2)(b), and in designating a vendor under subsection (2)(b), the commission shall consider comments submitted to the commission from consumers, telephone solicitors, or any other person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Beginning 90 days after the commission establishes a do-not-call list under subsection (2)(a) or designates a vendor to maintain a do-not-call list under subsection (2)(b), a telephone solicitor shall not make a telephone solicitation to a residential telephone subscriber whose name and residential telephone number is on the then-current version of that do-not-call list.</DIV>

In those instances, the assignor or transferor of the debt shall continue to be considered the creditor or the principal for purposes of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) "Person" means an individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, association, corporation, limited liability company, or other legal entity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) "Regulated person" means a person whose collection activities are confined and are directly related to the operation of a business other than that of a collection agency including any of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(xi) An attorney who is handling a claim or collection on behalf of a client and in the attorney's own name.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) As used in this act, "collecting or attempting to collect a claim", "repossessing or attempting to repossess a thing of value", and "collection activities" do not include any of the following activities of a claim forwarder or remarketer pursuant to a contract with a creditor:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Forwarding repossession assignments on behalf of the creditor only to a licensed collection agency that is licensed under article 9 of the occupational code, 1980 PA 299, MCL 339.901 to 339.920, for repossessing or attempting to repossess a thing of value owed or alleged to be owed on a claim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Pursuant to the authorization of a creditor and on the creditor's behalf, providing or procuring the services of an auction or other remarketer in connection with the disposition or preparation for disposition of a thing of value that was previously repossessed by a creditor or by another person on behalf of the creditor.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, the maximum number of installment payments required and the amount of each installment and the due date of each payment necessary to pay the time balance set forth in subparagraph (9). If installment payments other than the final payment are stated as a series of equal schedule amounts and if the amount of the final installment payment does not substantially exceed the scheduled amount of each preceding installment payment, the maximum number of payments and the amount and due date of each payment need not be separately stated and the amount of the scheduled final installment payment may be stated as the remaining unpaid balance.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A retail installment contract need not be contained in a single document. If the contract is contained in more than 1 document, 1 such document may be an original document signed by the retail buyer, stated to be applicable to purchases of goods or services to be made by the retail buyer from time to time. In such case, the document, together with the sales slip, account book or other written statement relating to each purchase, shall set forth all of the information required by this subsection and shall constitute the retail installment contract for each purchase. On each succeeding purchase pursuant to such original document, the sales slip, account book or other written statement at the option of the seller may constitute the memorandum required by section 11. No seller shall induce a buyer to become obligated at substantially the same time under more than 1 retail installment contract for the purpose of obtaining a higher time price differential than would apply to 1 contract.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 11.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If, in a retail installment transaction, a retail buyer purchases goods or services from a retail seller from whom he or she has previously purchased goods or services under 1 or more retail installment contracts, and the amounts under the previous contracts have not been fully paid, the subsequent purchases may be included in and consolidated with 1 or more of the previous contracts at the seller's option. Each subsequent purchase shall be a separate retail installment contract under this act, notwithstanding that the purchase may be included in and consolidated with 1 or more previous contracts. All the provisions of this act with respect to retail installment contracts apply to subsequent purchases except as otherwise provided in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   In the event of consolidation, if the buyer does not execute a retail installment contract respecting each subsequent purchase as provided in this act, the seller may prepare a written memorandum of each subsequent purchase and the provisions of section 3 do not apply. Unless previously furnished in writing to the buyer by the seller, by sales slip, memorandum, or otherwise, the memorandum shall contain items (1) to (8) of section 3(d) and the outstanding balance of the previous contract or contracts, the consolidated time balance, and the revised installments applicable to the consolidated time balance, if any. The seller shall deliver to the buyer a copy of the memorandum prior to the due date of the first installment of the consolidated contract.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   When subsequent purchases are made, if the seller has retained title or taken a lien or other security interest in any of the goods purchased under any 1 of the contracts included in the consolidation, the entire amount of all payments made prior to the subsequent purchases are considered to have been applied to the unpaid time balances of the previous purchases. Each payment after the subsequent purchase made on the consolidated contract shall be considered to have been allocated to all of the various purchases in the same ratio as the original cash sale prices of the various purchases bear to the total of all. Where the amount of each installment payment is increased in connection with subsequent purchases, at the seller's option, the subsequent payments may be considered to be allocated as an amount equal to the original periodic payment to the previous purchase, the balance to the subsequent purchase. The amount of a down payment on the subsequent purchase shall be allocated in its entirety to the subsequent purchase. This subsection does not apply if the previous and subsequent purchases involve equipment, parts or other goods attached or affixed to goods previously purchased and not fully paid, or to services rendered by the seller at the buyer's request.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   (1) The holder of a retail installment contract, upon agreement in writing with the buyer, may extend the scheduled due date or defer the scheduled payment of all or of any part of any installment or installments payable under the contract. A minimum charge of $1.00 for the period of extension or deferral may be made in any case where the extension or deferral charge, when computed at the rate permitted a regulated lender by the credit reform act, amounts to less than $1.00. The agreement may also provide for the buyer's payment of the additional cost to the holder of the contract of premiums for continuing in force until the end of the period of extension or deferral any insurance coverage provided for in the contract. The extension or deferral shall be confirmed in writing by the holder.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   (2) The holder of a retail installment contract, upon agreement in writing with the buyer, may refinance the payment of the unpaid time balance of the contract by providing for a new schedule of installment payments. The holder may charge and contract for the payment of a refinance charge by the buyer and collect and receive the refinance charge, but the refinance charge shall be based upon the amount refinanced, plus any additional cost of insurance and of official fees incident to the refinancing, after the deduction of a refund or credit in an amount equal to that to which the buyer would have been entitled under section 8, if he or she had prepaid in full his or her obligations under the contract or contracts, computed without allowance for any minimum earned finance charge. The refinance charge shall not exceed the rate of interest or its equivalent permitted a regulated lender by the credit reform act. The refinancing agreement shall set forth the amount of the unpaid time balance to be refinanced, the amount of any refund credit, the amount to be refinanced after the deduction of the refund credit, any additional premiums paid for insurance and of official fees to the buyer, the amount of the finance charge under the refinancing agreement, the new unpaid time balance, and the new schedule of installment payments.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 12.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A retail charge agreement shall be in writing and signed by the buyer or the authorized representative of the buyer. A retail charge agreement shall be considered signed and accepted by the buyer if after a request for a retail charge account the agreement or application for a retail charge account is in fact signed by the buyer or if the retail charge account is used by the buyer or by another person authorized by the buyer. The agreement may provide that it does not become effective until the seller or holder extends credit to the buyer, the buyer has received the disclosures required under the federal truth-in-lending act, 15 U.S.C. 1601 to 1608, 1610 to 1613, 1615, 1631 to 1635, 1637 to 1638, 1640 to 1647, and 1661 to 1667e, and the buyer or a person authorized by the buyer uses the retail charge account. A copy of the agreement shall be delivered or mailed to the buyer before the date the first payment is due under the agreement. The acknowledgment by the buyer of delivery of a copy of the agreement shall be in a size equal to at least 10-point boldfaced type and shall appear directly above the buyer's signature or the signature of the authorized representative of the buyer. An agreement shall not be signed by the buyer when it contains blank spaces for essential provisions of the transaction. The buyer's acknowledgment of delivery of a copy of an agreement in accordance with this section is presumptive proof in any action or proceeding of the delivery and that the agreement did not contain any blank spaces. A retail charge agreement shall state the maximum amount and rate of the time price differential to be charged and paid under the agreement. An agreement shall contain substantially the following notice printed or typed in a size equal to at least 10-point boldfaced type. "Notice to the buyer--Do not sign this agreement before you read it or if it contains blank spaces. You are entitled to a copy of the agreement you sign.".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The buyer under the retail charge agreement shall promptly be supplied with a statement if at the end of a monthly period, which need not be a calendar month, or other regular period agreed upon in writing, there is an unpaid balance under the agreement. The statement shall contain all of the following: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The unpaid balance under the retail charge agreement at the beginning and at the end of the period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The cash sale price of each purchase by the buyer during the period and, unless a sales slip or a memorandum of each purchase is attached to the statement, the purchase or posting date and a brief description or identification of each purchase.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The payments made by the buyer and any other credits to the buyer during the period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The amount, if any, of any time price differential for that period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A statement that the buyer at any time may pay his or her total unpaid balance or any part of that balance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A retail charge agreement may provide for, and the seller or holder may then charge, collect, and receive, a time price differential for the privilege of paying in installments under the agreement at a rate not greater than the rate permitted a regulated lender by the credit reform act, Act No. 162 of the Public Acts of 1995, being sections 445.1851 to 445.1864 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. The time price differential under this subsection shall be computed on all amounts unpaid under the agreement from month to month, which need not be calendar months, or other regular periods. If the regular period is other than a monthly period, the time price differential may be computed proportionately. The time price differential may be computed for all unpaid balances within a range of $10.00 or less on the basis of the median amount within that range if as so computed the time price differential is applied to all unpaid balances within that range. A minimum time price differential of not more than 70 cents per month may be charged, received, and collected.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The time price differential for purchases made under a retail charge agreement shall not be computed or imposed on an amount charged for the sale of goods or services until those goods or services have been delivered to the purchaser. If the time price differential is charged before delivery of the goods or services, the charges applied before the delivery date shall be adjusted upon the request of the purchaser in accordance with chapter 4 of the truth in lending act, title I of the consumer credit protection act, Public Law 90-321, 15 U.S.C. 1666 to 1666j.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   A retail charge agreement may also provide for the payment of an attorney's reasonable fee if it is referred for collection to an attorney not a salaried employee of the holder of the retail charge agreement or holder of an unpaid balance under the agreement, and for court costs.</DIV>

Examples of a bona fide error include clerical, calculation, computer malfunction, programming, or printing errors. An error in legal judgment with respect to a person's obligations under this act is not a bona fide error.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Instead of a time price differential computed on the original principal balance, the seller may charge from time to time a time price differential consisting of interest on the amount of the unpaid principal balance of the contract. The transaction is subject to this act as modified by the following provisions:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The number and amount of installment payments required to be stated under section 3 may be estimated for purposes of this section assuming that each scheduled payment is made on the date it is due and in the scheduled amount.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The holder of the contract has the option of deferring interest charges that accrue due to installment payments being received later than the periodic installment due date. The deferred interest charge shall be computed on the basis of additional interest charges accruing for late installment payments and appropriate interest reductions for installment payments made before the due date. On contracts providing for equal monthly installments, if the final installment is more than 105% of a previous installment as a result of the deferred interest charges, the installment buyer shall be given the option to pay the deferred interest charges not less than 25 days after the date the last installment payment is due.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If the entire principal balance is prepaid in full, together with all interest incurred to the date of prepayment, the balance of the original time price differential shall be canceled and the provisions of section 8 respecting a refund credit shall not be applicable.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 10.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The attorney general may bring a class action on behalf of persons residing in or injured in this state for the actual damages caused by any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A method, act, or practice in trade or commerce defined as unlawful under section 3.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A method, act, or practice in trade or commerce declared to be unlawful under section 3 (1) by a final judgment of the circuit court or an appellate court of this state which is either reported officially or made available for public dissemination pursuant to section 9 by the attorney general not less than 30 days before the method, act, or practice on which the action is based occurs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A method, act, or practice in trade or commerce declared by a circuit court of appeals or the supreme court of the United States to be an unfair or deceptive act or practice within the meaning of section 5(a)(1) of the federal trade commission act, 15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1), in a decision which affirms or directs the affirmance of a cease and desist order issued by the federal trade commission if the order is final within the meaning of section 5(g) of the federal trade commission act, 15 U.S.C. 45(g), and which is officially reported not less than 30 days before the method, act, or practice on which the action is based occurs. For purposes of this subdivision, a method, act, or practice shall not be deemed to be unfair or deceptive within the meaning of section 5(a)(1) of the federal trade commission act solely because the method, act, or practice is made unlawful by another federal statute that refers to or incorporates section 5(a)(1) of the federal trade commission act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   On motion of the attorney general and without bond in an action under this section the court may make an appropriate order: to reimburse persons who have suffered damages; to carry out a transaction in accordance with the aggrieved persons' reasonable expectations; to strike or limit the application of unconscionable clauses of contracts to avoid an unconscionable result; or to grant other appropriate relief. The court after a hearing may appoint a receiver or order sequestration of the defendant's assets if it appears to the satisfaction of the court that the defendant threatens or is about to remove, conceal, or dispose of his assets to the detriment of members of the class.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If at any stage of the proceedings the court requires that notice be sent to the class, the attorney general may petition the court to require the defendant to bear the cost of the notice. In determining whether to impose the cost on the defendant or the state, the court shall consider the probability that the attorney general will succeed on the merits of the action.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the defendant shows by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation of this act resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid the error, the amount of recovery shall be limited to actual damages.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   An action shall not be brought by the attorney general under this section more than 6 years after the occurrence of the method, act, or practice which is the subject of the action nor more than 1 year after the last payment in a transaction involving the method, act, or practice which is the subject of the action, whichever period of time ends on a later date.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   The wheelchair is out of service for an aggregate of at least 30 business days.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A manufacturer who sells or leases a wheelchair to a consumer, either directly or through a wheelchair dealer, shall furnish the consumer with an express warranty for the wheelchair. The duration of the express warranty shall be not less than 1 year after first delivery of a new wheelchair to the consumer or 60 days in the case of a used, refurbished or reconditioned wheelchair.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a manufacturer fails to furnish an express warranty as required by this section, the wheelchair shall be covered by a warranty from the manufacturer as if the manufacturer had furnished an express warranty to the consumer as required by this section.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a new wheelchair does not conform to an applicable express warranty and the consumer reports the nonconformity to the manufacturer, the wheelchair lessor, or any of the manufacturer's authorized wheelchair dealers and makes the wheelchair available for repair before 1 year after first delivery of the wheelchair to a consumer, the nonconformity shall be repaired by the manufacturer as required by this act. If the manufacturer has authorized the dealer to make the repair, the dealer shall be reimbursed by the manufacturer for the dealer's costs for the repair. The manufacturer shall respond to a dealer's request for authorization not later than the end of the business day following the day the request was made.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If, after a reasonable attempt to repair, the nonconformity is not repaired, the manufacturer shall do 1 of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the wheelchair was purchased, at the direction of a consumer do 1 of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Accept return of the wheelchair and replace the wheelchair with 1 of comparable quality, size, and function and refund any collateral costs to the consumer, a holder of a security interest, or a third party who purchased the wheelchair.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Accept return of the wheelchair and refund to the consumer and to any holder of a perfected security interest in the consumer's wheelchair or third party who purchased the wheelchair not more than the full purchase price plus any finance charge, sales tax, shipping costs, and collateral costs paid by the consumer, the holder of a security interest, or the third party who purchased the wheelchair less a reasonable allowance for use. A reasonable allowance for use shall not exceed the amount obtained by multiplying the full purchase price of the wheelchair by a fraction, the denominator of which is 1,825 and the numerator of which is the number of days that the wheelchair was used before the consumer first reported the nonconformity to the wheelchair dealer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the wheelchair is leased, accept return of the wheelchair, refund to the wheelchair lessor and to any holder of a perfected security interest in the wheelchair the current value of the written lease and refund to the consumer or third party the amount that the consumer or third party paid under the written lease plus any collateral costs, less a reasonable allowance for use. The current value of the written lease equals the total amount for which that lease obligates the consumer during the period of the lease remaining after its early termination, plus the wheelchair dealer's early termination costs and the value of the wheelchair at the lease expiration date if the lease sets forth that value, less the wheelchair lessor's early termination savings. A reasonable allowance for use shall not exceed the amount obtained by multiplying the total amount for which the written lease obligates the consumer by a fraction, the denominator of which is 1,825 and the numerator of which is the number of days that the wheelchair was used before the consumer first reported the nonconformity to the manufacturer, wheelchair lessor, or wheelchair dealer.</DIV>

An agreement may further provide that if the interest rate paid at 2 successive auctions of 26-week United States treasury bills is 8% or more, then on a home improvement charge sale made after that date the time price differential shall not exceed 1.375% of the unpaid balance per month, but if the interest rate paid at 2 successive auctions of 26-week United States treasury bills falls below 8%, then the time price differential on a home improvement charge sale made after that date shall not exceed 1.2% of the unpaid balance per month, unless the interest rate paid at 2 successive auctions of 26-week United States treasury bills again is 8% or more, in which case the time price differential on a home improvement charge sale made after that date shall not exceed 1.375% of the unpaid balance per month.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A home improvement installment contract may provide for the payment by the buyer of a delinquency and collection charge on each installment in default for a period of not less than 10 days in an amount not in excess of 5% of such installment or $5.00, whichever is less. Only 1 such delinquency and collection charge may be collected on any such installment regardless of the period during which it remains in default.

</P>
<P>Sec. 301.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The maximum finance charge included in a home improvement installment contract payable in substantially equal successive monthly installments beginning 1 month from the date the finance charge accrues, shall not exceed $8.00 per $100.00 per annum. However, on a contract which is entered into before December 31, 1991, and which is entered into after the interest rate paid at 2 successive auctions of 26 week United States treasury bills is 8% or more, the finance charge may be equivalent to 16.5% interest or less per annum on the unpaid balance. If the interest rate paid at 2 successive auctions of 26 weeks United States treasury bills again falls below 8%, the finance charge on a contract entered into after that date shall not exceed $8.00 per $100.00 per annum, unless the interest rate paid at 2 successive auctions of 26 week United States treasury bills again is 8% or more, in which case the finance charge may be equivalent to 16.5% interest or less per annum on the unpaid balance. The finance charge shall be computed on the principal amount financed on the contract notwithstanding that the time balance is required to be paid in installments. The finance charge shall not accrue over a longer period than one which commences on the date of completion of the contract and ends on the date when the final installment is payable. For a period less or greater than 12 months or for amounts less or greater than $100.00, the amount of the maximum finance charge shall be increased o r decreased proportionately. A fractional monthly period of 15 days or more may be considered a full month. If the finance charge computed as above provided is less than $12.00, a minimum finance charge of $12.00 may be made.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Subject to the limitations in subsection (3), if a contract is payable other than in substantially equal successive monthly installments, as where payable in irregular or unequal installments either in amount or periods thereof, or in regular installments followed by or interspersed with an irregular, unequal or larger installment or installments, or if the finance charge accrues from a date more than 1 month before the first installment is payable, the finance charge may not exceed an amount which, having due regard for the schedule of installment payments, will provide the same yield as if the contract were payable in accordance with the standard payment terms stated in subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the amount of any installment is 2 times or more the amount of any other installment except the down payment, the amount of the finance charge in respect to the portion of the principal amount financed included in such larger installment shall not exceed the equivalent of 6% per annum simple interest for the period from the due date on which finance charge begins to accrue to the date of such larger installment and such portion of the finance charge shall be payable in substantially equal periodic installments throughout such period.</DIV>

Except as provided in subsection (2), the amount of the refund credit shall represent at least as great a proportion of the finance charge, or if the contract has been extended, deferred, or refinanced, of the additional charge therefor, as the sum of the periodical time balance scheduled by the contract to follow the installment date after the day of prepayment bears to the sum of all the periodical time balances under the schedule of installments in the contract or, if the contract has been extended, deferred, or refinanced, as so extended, deferred, or refinanced.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a part of the finance charge is computed on an installment as provided in section 301(3), the amount of the refund credit applicable to that part of the finance charge shall represent at least as great a proportion of that part of the finance charge as the number of months to elapse after the month in which prepayment is made to the due date of that installment bears to the number of months from the date the finance charge accrues to the due date of that installment.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The holder of a home improvement installment contract, upon agreement in writing with the buyer, may refinance the payment of the unpaid time balance of the contract by providing for a new schedule of installment payments. The holder may charge and contract for the payment of a refinanced charge by the buyer and collect and receive the same, but such refinance charge shall be based upon the amount refinanced, plus any additional cost of insurance and of official fees incident to such refinancing, after the deduction of a refund credit in an amount equal to that to which the buyer would have been entitled under section 303 if he had prepaid in full his obligations under the contract or contracts, computed without allowance for any minimum earned finance charge. Such refinance charge shall not exceed the rate of finance charge provided under section 301. The agreement for refinancing may also provide for the payment by the buyer of the additional cost to the holder of the contract of premiums for continuing in force, until the maturity of the contract as refinanced, any insurance coverages provided therein.

</P>
<P>Sec. 309.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Instead of a finance charge computed on the principal amount financed as determined under section 203 or 308, the seller may charge from time to time a finance charge consisting of interest on the amount of the unpaid principal balance of the contract. In this event, the transaction shall be subject to this act as modified by the following provisions:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Finance charge shall mean the estimated amount of consideration in excess of the cash price which the buyer will pay in the form of interest assuming that each scheduled payment is made on the date it is due and in the scheduled amount.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The maximum estimated finance charge shall not exceed the maximum dollar amount allowed pursuant to section 301 for contracts of the same contractual maturity computed on the actual number of days between installment payments.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The number and amount of installment payments required to be stated pursuant to sections 203 and 308 shall be estimated for purposes of this section assuming that each scheduled payment is made on the date it is due and in the scheduled amount.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The holder of the contract shall have the option of deferring interest charges which accrue due to installment payments being received later than the periodic installment due date. The deferred interest charge shall be computed on the basis of additional interest charges accruing for late installment payments and appropriate interest reductions for installment payments made before the due date. On contracts providing for equal monthly installments, if the final installment is more than 105% of a previous installment as a result of the deferred interest charges, the installment buyer shall be given the option to pay the deferred interest charges not less than 25 days after the date the last installment payment is due.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   If the entire principal balance is prepaid in full, together with all interest incurred to the date of prepayment, the balance of the original finance charge shall be canceled and the provisions of section 303 respecting a refund credit shall not be applicable.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The supplier shall pay the dealer at least 75% of the supplier's net price last published for any new dealer supplies purchased from the supplier.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   No specialized repair tool that is not complete and in usage condition is required to be purchased.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Upon payment of the repurchase amount to the dealer, the title and right of possession to the repurchased inventory shall transfer to the supplier.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The supplier may subtract from the sums due under subsection (1) or (2) the amount of debts owed by the dealer to the supplier.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   With or without the prior consent or authorization of a supplier, a dealer may ship all inventory suitable for repurchase to the supplier, not less than 60 days after the supplier has notified the dealer, or the dealer has notified the supplier by certified mail, that the agreement between them has been terminated. The supplier shall inspect a dealer's inventory within 30 days of termination of the agreement and designate portions of that inventory to be not returnable under this act. However, such a designation received by the dealer more than 30 days after the termination is not effective.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Not more than 90 days from the termination of the agreement, the dealer may ship inventory to any location from which inventory of like kind has been shipped to the dealer in the 12 months preceding the shipment, or if no shipment of such type of inventory has occurred in that time period, to any place of business maintained by the supplier. Freight to such destination shall be paid by the dealer. The supplier shall accept a shipment made pursuant to this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If a properly shipped shipment is undeliverable, or not accepted by the supplier, the dealer may order the inventory returned, may order it stored for the supplier's account, or may order it liquidated or abandoned by the carrier. All risk of loss to properly shipped but undeliverable or unaccepted goods is the supplier's, including, but not limited to, losses from exposure, liquidation, abandonment, or theft. A supplier's acceptance of a shipment does not constitute an admission that the inventory inspected by the supplier before shipment pursuant to subsection (5) and declared not returnable must be repurchased, but that all properly shipped inventory that is not deliverable or not accepted is considered to have been properly submitted for repurchase, and the supplier is liable to pay the repurchase amount for that inventory.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Instead of the return of the inventory to the supplier under the terms of subsection (7), a dealer may notify a supplier by certified mail that the dealer has inventory that the dealer intends to return. The notice of the dealer's intention to return shall be in writing, sworn to before a notary public as to the accuracy of the listing of inventory and the suitability of the items for repurchase. The notice shall include the name and business address of the person or business who has possession and custody of the inventory and the location where the inventory may be inspected and the list of inventory may be verified. The notice must also state the name and business address of the person or business who has the authority to serve as the escrow agent of the dealer, to accept payment or a credit to the dealer's account on behalf of the dealer, and to release the machinery and parts to the supplier. The notice constitutes the appointment of the escrow agent to act on the dealer's behalf regarding the activities described in this subsection. The escrow agent shall be a person or business that is independent of the dealership, dealer principal, or any employees of the dealership or supplier.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   The supplier has 30 days from the date of the mailing of the notice described in subsection (8) in which to inspect the inventory and verify the accuracy of the dealer's list. The supplier shall, within 10 days after inspection, do 1 of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Pay the escrow agent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Give evidence that a credit to the account of the dealer has been made if the dealer has outstanding sums due the supplier.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Send to the escrow agent a credit list and shipping labels for the return of the inventory to the supplier that are acceptable as returns.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   If the supplier sends a credit list to the escrow agent, payment or a credit against the dealer's indebtedness in accordance with subsection (9) for the acceptable returns shall accompany the credit list. Upon receipt of the payment, evidence of a credit to the account of the dealer, or the credit list with payment, the title to the inventory acceptable as returns passes to the supplier making the payment or allowing the credit and the supplier is entitled to keep the inventory. The escrow agent shall ship or cause to be shipped the inventory acceptable as returns to the supplier unless the supplier elects to personally perform the inventorying, packing, and loading.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   When the inventory has been received by the supplier, notice of the receipt of the inventory shall be sent by certified mail to the escrow agent who shall then disburse 90% of the payment he or she has received, less its actual expenses and a reasonable fee for his or her services, to the dealer. The escrow agent shall keep the balance of the funds in the dealer's escrow account until he or she is notified that an agreement has been reached as to the nonreturnables, after which the escrow agent shall disburse the remaining funds and dispose of any remaining inventory as provided in the settlement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   Whenever an agreement provides for a dealer to service consumer warranties by repairing, returning, or replacing inventory, the supplier shall pay any warranty claim made by or through the dealer for warranty parts or service within 90 days after the notice of termination of the agreement. If a claim is not specifically disapproved in writing during the 90-day period after notice of termination of an agreement, stating in detail the reasons for the disapproval, the claim shall be considered approved and the supplier shall pay the dealer for all parts and service applied to the servicing of the warranty claim.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   If a warranty claim is approved or considered approved under subsection (12) but repairs are not made, the supplier is not obligated to pay the dealer. However, the supplier shall accept for return by the dealer any inventory purchased, received, or set aside by the dealer for servicing of the claim unless, while in the possession of the dealer, the inventory has ceased to be in appropriate condition for return.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(14)   Inventory in possession of a supplier and identified to a warranty claim made by or through a dealer on the date of the notice of termination of the agreement may be shipped by the supplier, at the dealer's option, provided that if the dealer directs the supplier to ship the inventory after notice of termination of the agreement, that inventory shall not be returnable.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A supplier shall not terminate, cancel, fail to renew, or substantially change the competitive circumstances of an agreement without good cause. A supplier shall provide a dealer at least 90 days' prior written notice of termination, cancellation, nonrenewal, or substantial change in competitive circumstances. The notice shall state the reasons or deficiencies for the action, and the dealer has 90 days to submit a plan to correct the stated reasons or deficiencies that is acceptable to the supplier or to correct the stated reasons or deficiencies.

</P>
<P>Sec. 27.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Each of the following provisions is void and unenforceable if contained in any documents relating to a franchise:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A prohibition on the right of a franchisee to join an association of franchisees.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A requirement that a franchisee assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver, or estoppel which deprives a franchisee of rights and protections provided in this act. This shall not preclude a franchisee, after entering into a franchise agreement, from settling any and all claims.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A provision that permits a franchisor to terminate a franchise prior to the expiration of its term except for good cause. Good cause shall include the failure of the franchisee to comply with any lawful provision of the franchise agreement and to cure such failure after being given written notice thereof and a reasonable opportunity, which in no event need be more than 30 days, to cure such failure.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A provision that permits a franchisor to refuse to renew a franchise without fairly compensating the franchisee by repurchase or other means for the fair market value at the time of expiration of the franchisee's inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings. Personalized materials which have no value to the franchisor and inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings not reasonably required in the conduct of the franchise business are not subject to compensation. This subsection applies only if: (i) The term of the franchise is less than 5 years and (ii) the franchisee is prohibited by the franchise or other agreement from continuing to conduct substantially the same business under another trademark, service mark, trade name, logotype, advertising, or other commercial symbol in the same area subsequent to the expiration of the franchise or the franchisee does not receive at least 6 months advance notice of franchisor's intent not to renew the franchise.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   A provision that permits the franchisor to refuse to renew a franchise on terms generally available to other franchisees of the same class or type under similar circumstances. This section does not require a renewal provision.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   A provision requiring that arbitration or litigation be conducted outside this state. This shall not preclude the franchisee from entering into an agreement, at the time of arbitration, to conduct arbitration at a location outside this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   A provision which permits a franchisor to refuse to permit a transfer of ownership of a franchise, except for good cause. This subdivision does not prevent a franchisor from exercising a right of first refusal to purchase the franchise. Good cause shall include, but is not limited to:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The failure of the proposed transferee to meet the franchisor's then current reasonable qualifications or standards.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   The fact that the proposed transferee is a competitor of the franchisor or subfranchisor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   The unwillingness of the proposed transferee to agree in writing to comply with all lawful obligations.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)   The failure of the franchisee or proposed transferee to pay any sums owing to the franchisor or to cure any default in the franchise agreement existing at the time of the proposed transfer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   A provision that requires the franchisee to resell to the franchisor items that are not uniquely identified with the franchisor. This subdivision does not prohibit a provision that grants to a franchisor a right of first refusal to purchase the assets of a franchise on the same terms and conditions as a bona fide third party willing and able to purchase those assets, nor does this subdivision prohibit a provision that grants the franchisor the right to acquire the assets of a franchise for the market or appraised value of such assets if the franchisee has breached the lawful provisions of the franchise agreement and has failed to cure the breach in the manner provided in subdivision (c).</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A person who offers or sells a franchise in violation of section 5 or 8 is liable to the person purchasing the franchise for damages or rescission, with interest at 6% per year from the date of purchase until June 20, 1984 and 12% per year thereafter and reasonable attorney fees and court costs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A person may not file or maintain suit under this section if the franchisee received a written offer before suit and at a time when the franchisee owned the franchise to refund the consideration paid together with interest from the date of purchase at 1 percentage point above the rate provided by subsection (1), less the amount of income received on the franchise, conditioned only upon tender by the person of all items received by the franchisee for the consideration and not sold, and failed to accept the offer within 30 days of its receipt, or if the franchisee received the offer before suit and at a time when the franchisee did not own the franchise, unless the franchisee rejected the offer in writing within 30 days of its receipt. The rescission offer shall recite the provisions of this section. If the franchise involves substantial building or substantial equipment and a significant period of time has elapsed since the sale of the franchise to the franchisee, the rescission offer may recognize depreciation, amortization, and other factors which bear upon the value of the franchise being returned to the franchisor.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A manufacturer shall not require any new motor vehicle dealer in this state to do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Order or accept delivery of any new motor vehicle, a part or accessory of a new motor vehicle, equipment, or any other commodity not required by law that is not voluntarily ordered by the new motor vehicle dealer. This section does not prevent the manufacturer from requiring that new motor vehicle dealers carry a reasonable inventory of models offered for sale by the manufacturer. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Order or accept delivery of any new motor vehicle with special features, accessories, or equipment not included in the list price of the new motor vehicle as publicly advertised by the manufacturer. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Participate monetarily in any advertising campaign or contest, purchase any promotional materials, display devices, or display decorations or materials, or pay or assume directly in connection with the sale of a new motor vehicle any part of the cost of a refund, rebate, or discount made by or lawfully imposed by the manufacturer to or in favor of a consumer, unless voluntarily agreed to by the dealer. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Enter into any agreement with the manufacturer or do any other act prejudicial to the new motor vehicle dealer by threatening to terminate a dealer agreement or any contractual agreement existing between the dealer and the manufacturer. Notice in good faith to any dealer of the dealer's violation of any terms or provisions of the dealer agreement does not constitute a violation of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Change the capital structure of the new motor vehicle dealership or the means by or through which the dealer finances the operation of the dealership, if the dealership at all times meets any reasonable capital standards determined by the manufacturer in accordance with uniformly applied criteria.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Refrain from participation in the management of, investment in, or the acquisition of, any other line of new motor vehicles or related products at or in any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) At a location different from the location used by the dealer for the sale or service of new motor vehicles or related products of the manufacturer, if the dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit for each make or line of vehicle, remains in compliance with reasonable facilities requirements, remains in substantial compliance with capital requirements, and makes no change in the principal management of the dealer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) In facilities at the same location as, but separated from, the facilities used by the dealer for the sale or service of new motor vehicles or related products of the manufacturer, if the dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit for each make or line of vehicle, remains in compliance with minimum space requirements and reasonable facilities requirements, remains in substantial compliance with capital requirements, and does not make a change in the principal management of the dealer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Unless the manufacturer otherwise objects based on other reasonable business considerations, in the same facilities used by the dealer for the sale or service of new motor vehicles or related products of the manufacturer, if the dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit for each make or line of vehicle, remains in compliance with reasonable facilities requirements, remains in substantial compliance with capital requirements, and does not make a change in the principal management of the dealer. The manufacturer has the burden of proving reasonable business considerations for purposes of this subparagraph.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Change the location of the new motor vehicle dealership or make any substantial alterations to the dealership premises, if changing the location or making the alterations is unreasonable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Prospectively assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver, or estoppel that would relieve any person from liability imposed by this act; require that any dealer agreement be governed by the laws of a state other than this state; or require referral of any controversy between a new motor vehicle dealer and a manufacturer to a person other than the duly constituted courts of this state, or of the United States located in this state, if the referral would be binding on the new motor vehicle dealer. This subdivision does not apply to an agreement between the parties, made at the time of a controversy, to refer the controversy to a court of the United States located outside this state or agree at the time of an arbitration to conduct the arbitration either in or outside of this state. A provision in a dealer agreement that violates this subdivision is void and unenforceable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Construct or substantially alter a facility or premises if the same item or design component, consisting of interior or exterior elements of the sales, service, administrative, or parts components, was constructed or substantially altered within the previous 10 years and that construction or alteration was required and approved by the manufacturer or distributor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Subject to subsection (3), require a new motor vehicle dealer to purchase goods or services to make improvements to the dealer's facilities from a vendor that is selected, identified, or designated by the manufacturer or an affiliate of the manufacturer, unless the dealer is allowed to obtain the goods or services from a vendor chosen by the dealer if all of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The goods or services offered by the vendor chosen by the dealer are of the same material, quality, and overall design.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The vendor chosen by the dealer is approved by the manufacturer. A manufacturer shall not unreasonably withhold its consent for purposes of this subparagraph.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The manufacturer is not providing substantial reimbursement or compensation to the dealer for the goods or services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) Subject to subsection (3), require a new motor vehicle dealer to lease signs, except for signs that contain the manufacturer's intellectual property or free-standing signs that are not directly attached to a building, or other manufacturer image or design elements or trade dress, from a vendor selected, identified, or designated by the manufacturer, unless the dealer is allowed to purchase the signs or other image or design elements or trade dress from a vendor chosen by the dealer if all of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The signs offered by the vendor chosen by the dealer are of the same material, quality, and overall design.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The signs are approved by the manufacturer. A manufacturer shall not unreasonably withhold its consent for purposes of this subparagraph.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) Except as required by the manufacturer for warranty repairs, recall repairs, or other services or programs paid for by the manufacturer, or unless otherwise agreed, require a new motor vehicle dealer to purchase fluids or lubricants from a particular vendor, if fluids or lubricants of the same material and quality are available from another vendor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If, during the 10-year period described in subsection (1)(i), a manufacturer establishes a new program, standard, policy, bonus, incentive, rebate, or other benefit, a new motor vehicle dealer is eligible for the new program, standard, policy, bonus, incentive, rebate, or other benefit if the dealer fully complies with the new standards set by the manufacturer in the new program, standard, policy, bonus, incentive, or other benefit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Subsection (1)(j) and subsection (1)(k) do not allow a new motor vehicle dealer or a vendor chosen by the dealer to impair, infringe upon, or eliminate, directly or indirectly, the intellectual property rights of the manufacturer, including, but not limited to, the manufacturer's intellectual property rights in any trademarks or trade dress, or other intellectual property interests owned or controlled by the manufacturer, or to permit a new motor vehicle dealer to erect or maintain signs that do not conform to the manufacturer's intellectual property rights or trademark or trade dress usage guidelines.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Construction" means the construction of new sales or service facilities by a new motor vehicle dealer, or the substantial remodeling, improvement, renovation, expansion, replacement, or alteration of a dealer's existing sales or service facilities. The term does not include installation of signs or other image elements that are subject to the intellectual property rights of the manufacturer, including logos, trademarks, trade dress, patents, or other intellectual property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Goods" does not include movable displays, brochures, and promotional materials containing material that is subject to the intellectual property rights of a manufacturer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Substantial reimbursement" means an amount equal to or greater than the cost savings that would result if a new motor vehicle dealer utilized a vendor of the dealer's own selection instead of using the vendor selected, identified, or designated by the manufacturer or an affiliate of the manufacturer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Substantial alteration" means an alteration that has a major impact on the architectural features, characteristics, appearance, or integrity of a structure or lot. The term does not include routine maintenance that is reasonably necessary to maintain a dealership facility in attractive condition and does not include any changes to items protected by federal intellectual property rights.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>445.1574 Prohibited conduct by manufacturer.</B><P>Sec. 14.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A manufacturer shall not do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Adopt, change, establish, or implement a plan or system for the allocation and distribution of new motor vehicles to new motor vehicle dealers that is arbitrary or capricious or based on unreasonable sales and service standards, or modify an existing plan or system that causes the plan or system to be arbitrary or capricious or based on unreasonable sales and service standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If requested in writing by a new motor vehicle dealer, fail or refuse to advise or disclose to the dealer the basis on which new motor vehicles of the same line-make are allocated or distributed to new motor vehicle dealers in this state and the basis on which the current allocation or distribution is being made or will be made to that new motor vehicle dealer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Refuse to deliver to a new motor vehicle dealer in reasonable quantities and within a reasonable time after receipt of the dealer's order, any new motor vehicles that are covered by the dealer agreement and specifically publicly advertised in this state by the manufacturer as available for immediate delivery. However, the failure to deliver any motor vehicle is not considered a violation of this act if the failure is due to an act of God, a work stoppage or delay due to a strike or labor difficulty, a shortage of materials, a lack of manufacturing capacity, a freight embargo, or other cause over which the manufacturer has no control. If a manufacturer requires a new motor vehicle dealer to purchase essential service tools with a purchase price in the aggregate of more than $7,500.00 in order to receive a specific model of vehicle, the manufacturer shall on written request provide the dealer with a good faith estimate in writing of the number of vehicles of that specific model the dealer will be allocated in the model year in which the dealer is required to purchase the tool. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Increase the price of a new motor vehicle that the new motor vehicle dealer had ordered, and then eventually delivered to, the same retail consumer for whom the vehicle was ordered, if the order was made before the dealer's receipt of a written official price increase notification. A sales contract signed by a private retail consumer and binding on the dealer constitutes evidence of a vehicle order. In the event of manufacturer price reductions or cash rebates, the dealer shall pass on the amount of any reduction or rebate received by the dealer to the private retail consumer. Any price reduction in excess of $5.00 shall apply to all vehicles in the dealer's inventory that were subject to the price reduction. A price difference applicable to new model or series motor vehicles at the time of the introduction of the new models or the series is not considered a price increase or price decrease. This subdivision does not apply to price changes caused by any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The addition to a motor vehicle of required or optional equipment under state or federal law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) In the case of foreign made vehicles or components, revaluation of the United States dollar.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Any increase in transportation charges due to an increase in rates charged by a common carrier or transporter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Offer any of the following to any new motor vehicle dealer of a specific line-make without making the same offer available to all other new motor vehicle dealers of the same line-make:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Any specific model or series of new motor vehicles manufactured for that line-make.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Any incentives, rebates, bonuses, promotional items, or other similar benefits payable to the new motor vehicle dealer for selling new motor vehicles or purchasing new motor vehicles from the manufacturer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Any consumer rebates, vehicle price reductions, or interest rate reductions or other changes to finance terms that benefit the consumer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Any program that provides marketing and sales assistance to new motor vehicle dealers, including, but not limited to, internet listings, sales leads, marketing programs, and dealer recognition programs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Release to an outside party, except under subpoena or in an administrative or judicial proceeding to which the new motor vehicle dealer or the manufacturer are parties, any business, financial, or personal information that has been provided by the dealer to the manufacturer, unless the new motor vehicle dealer gives written consent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Deny a new motor vehicle dealer the right to associate with another new motor vehicle dealer for any lawful purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Directly or indirectly own, operate, or control a new motor vehicle dealer, including, but not limited to, a new motor vehicle dealer engaged primarily in performing warranty repair services on motor vehicles under the manufacturer's warranty, or a used motor vehicle dealer. This subdivision does not apply to any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The ownership, operation, or control by a manufacturer of a new motor vehicle dealer for a period of not more than 24 months during the transition from 1 owner or operator to another. The circuit court may extend the 24-month time period for an additional 12 months upon receipt of an application from a manufacturer and a showing of good cause.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The ownership, operation, or control of a new motor vehicle dealer or a used motor vehicle dealer by a manufacturer while it is being sold under a bona fide contract or purchase option to the operator of the new motor vehicle dealer or the used motor vehicle dealer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The direct or indirect ownership by a manufacturer of an entity that owns, operates, or controls a new motor vehicle dealer of the same line-make franchised by the manufacturer, if all of the following conditions are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) As of May 1, 2000, the manufacturer for a period of not less than 12 months has continuously owned, directly or indirectly, 1 or more new motor vehicle dealers in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) All of the new motor vehicle dealers selling the manufacturer's motor vehicles in this state trade exclusively in the manufacturer's line-make.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(C) As of January 1, 2000, not fewer than 1/2 of the new motor vehicle dealers of the line-make within this state own and operate 2 or more new motor vehicle dealer facilities in the geographic territory or area covered by the franchise agreement with the manufacturer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(D) For a manufacturer or any entity in which the manufacturer has more than a 45% ownership interest, the manufacturer or entity has not acquired, operated, or controlled a new motor vehicle dealer that the manufacturer did not directly or indirectly own as of May 1, 2000.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The acquisition by a manufacturer of a used motor vehicle dealer's license for the purpose of selling motor vehicles to nonretail buyers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Sell any new motor vehicle directly to a retail customer other than through franchised dealers, unless the retail customer is a nonprofit organization or a federal, state, or local government or agency. This subdivision does not prohibit a manufacturer from providing information to a consumer for the purpose of marketing or facilitating the sale of new motor vehicles or from establishing a program to sell or offer to sell new motor vehicles through franchised new motor vehicle dealers that sell and service new motor vehicles produced by the manufacturer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or otherwise any new motor vehicle dealer from changing the executive management of a new motor vehicle dealer unless the manufacturer, having the burden of proof, can show that the change of executive management will result in executive management by a person or persons who are not of good moral character or who do not meet reasonable, preexisting, and equitably applied standards of the manufacturer. If a manufacturer rejects a proposed change in the executive management, the manufacturer shall give written notice of its reasons to the dealer within 75 days after receiving written notice from the dealer of the proposed change and all related information reasonably requested by the manufacturer, or the change in executive management is considered approved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) Unreasonably withhold consent to the sale, transfer, or exchange of a new motor vehicle dealership to a qualified buyer that meets the manufacturer's uniformly applied requirements and criteria to be a new motor vehicle dealer and that is capable of being licensed as a new motor vehicle dealer in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) Fail to respond to a written request from a new motor vehicle dealer that has submitted an agreement for the sale, transfer, or exchange of a new motor vehicle dealership. The manufacturer shall provide the dealer with all forms generally utilized and requested by the manufacturer for the approval of a sale, transfer, or exchange of a new motor vehicle dealership not later than 30 days after receiving a written request from the dealer for the forms. A manufacturer shall have 75 days after the date the manufacturer receives all the properly completed forms and information generally utilized and requested by the manufacturer to approve or disapprove the sale, transfer, or exchange of the new motor vehicle dealership. The failure of the manufacturer to approve or disapprove the sale, transfer, or exchange within the 75-day time period is considered approval.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) Unfairly prevent a new motor vehicle dealer that sells, transfers, or exchanges a new motor vehicle dealership from receiving reasonable compensation for the value of the new motor vehicle dealership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) Subject to section 13(1)(i) and (2), unless the manufacturer enters into a written agreement with the new motor vehicle dealer that clearly states the amount of the incentive payments and the period of time during which the incentive payments are paid, offer incentive payments to a new motor vehicle dealer in consideration for a new motor vehicle dealer's promise to do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Make material alterations to any facilities at the dealer's place of business.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Construct new facilities for the conduct of the business of the dealership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(o) Require unreasonable improvements to a facility as a condition to entering into or renewing a dealer agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(p) Authorize a motor vehicle service and repair facility to perform motor vehicle warranty repairs and recall work, unless the work meets any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Is required for emergency service of a vehicle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Is work performed at a service center owned or operated by a manufacturer on a manufacturer-owned vehicle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Is work performed by employees of a fleet operator on its own vehicles.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(q) Own a motor vehicle service and repair facility, except that a manufacturer may own a service and repair facility for the repair of manufacturer-owned vehicles.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(r) Engage in conduct that meets all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Materially affects a new motor vehicle dealer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Is capricious, is not in good faith, or is unconscionable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Causes material damage to a new motor vehicle dealer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(s) Require, attempt to require, coerce, or attempt to coerce a new motor vehicle dealer to adhere to unreasonable performance standards that are not applied uniformly to other similarly situated new motor vehicle dealers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(t) Use or consider the performance of a new motor vehicle dealer in selling the manufacturer's vehicles or the new motor vehicle dealer's ability to satisfy any minimum sales or market share quota or responsibility relating to the sale of the new motor vehicles in determining any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The new motor vehicle dealer's eligibility to purchase program, certified, or other used motor vehicles from the manufacturer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The volume, type, or model of program, certified, or other used motor vehicles that a new motor vehicle dealer is eligible to purchase from the manufacturer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The price of any program, certified, or other used motor vehicle that the new motor vehicle dealer purchases from the manufacturer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The availability or amount of any discount, credit, rebate, or sales incentive that the new motor vehicle dealer is eligible to receive from the manufacturer in connection with any program, certified, or other used motor vehicle offered for sale by the manufacturer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(u) Require that a new motor vehicle dealer provide its customer lists or service files to the manufacturer, unless necessary for the sale and delivery of a new motor vehicle to a consumer, to validate and pay consumer or dealer incentives, or in connection with the submission of a claim to the manufacturer for services supplied by the new motor vehicle dealer for any claim for warranty repairs. This section does not limit a manufacturer's authority to require or use customer information to satisfy any safety or recall obligation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Establish a performance standard or program for measuring new motor vehicle dealer performance that may have a material and adverse impact on a new motor vehicle dealer that is not fair, reasonable, and equitable. For purposes of this subdivision, all of the following apply if a manufacturer does not provide a complete program description explaining the performance standard or program details to a new motor vehicle dealer on or before the beginning of the program:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Within 10 days after receiving a request from the new motor vehicle dealer, the manufacturer shall provide the new motor vehicle dealer with a written description of how a performance standard or program is designed. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Within 30 days after receiving a written request from the new motor vehicle dealer, the manufacturer shall provide all of the following to the dealer:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) The specific information relied on by the manufacturer relating to how the performance standard or program was applied to the new motor vehicle dealer. The manufacturer is not required to disclose any proprietary or confidential information for purposes of this sub-subparagraph. However, the result of the application of a performance standard or program to a particular new motor vehicle dealer is not considered proprietary or confidential as between the manufacturer and that particular new motor vehicle dealer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) An explanation as to how the manufacturer applies a performance standard or program to a new motor vehicle dealer's performance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) On written request, a manufacturer or a new motor vehicle dealer shall meet with the other party, in person or telephonically, under reasonable circumstances and as agreed to by both parties, to present, explain, or discuss information the manufacturer is required to provide under subparagraph (ii)(A) and (B).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(w) If a new motor vehicle dealer sold or leased a new motor vehicle to a customer that exported the motor vehicle to a foreign country or resold the motor vehicle, and at the time of delivery to the customer the vehicle was titled and registered in this state or another state of the United States by the dealer, refuse to allocate, sell, or deliver new motor vehicles to the dealer; charge back or withhold payments or other things of value for which the dealer is otherwise eligible under a sales promotion, program, or contest; prevent a new motor vehicle dealer from participating in any sales promotion, program, or contest; or take or threaten to take any other adverse action against a new motor vehicle dealer, including, but not limited to, reducing vehicle allocations or terminating or threatening to terminate a dealer agreement, unless the manufacturer proves that the new motor vehicle dealer knew or reasonably should have known that the customer intended to export or resell the motor vehicle. In an action by a new motor vehicle dealer for a violation of this subdivision, there is a rebuttable presumption that a new motor vehicle dealer did not know or should not reasonably have known of its customer's intent to export or resell a motor vehicle if the vehicle was titled and registered in the United States, and the manufacturer bears the burden of rebutting that presumption.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(x) If a new motor vehicle dealer is a party to a dealer agreement on August 4, 2010, and the dealer agreement provides for sale of a competing line-make of new motor vehicles at the same place of business where the manufacturer's line-make is sold, require or otherwise coerce the new motor vehicle dealer to remove the sale or servicing of new motor vehicles of that competing line-make from that place of business.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(y) Prevent, attempt to prevent, prohibit, coerce, or attempt to coerce a new motor vehicle dealer from charging a consumer any documentary preparation fee allowed to be charged by the dealer under the laws of this state or require the disclosure of the documentary preparation fee in a written format that is not otherwise required by law. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(z) Prohibit, prevent, or attempt to prevent a new motor vehicle dealer from transferring a dealership to or naming a spouse, child, or executive manager as dealership successor to own and operate the dealership unless the manufacturer, having the burden of proof, can show that at the time the successor is named or the dealership is transferred, the successor spouse, child, or executive manager of the dealer is not of good moral character, has a felony conviction, does not meet the manufacturer's uniformly applied requirements and criteria to be a dealer, or is otherwise disqualified from holding a license as a new motor vehicle dealer under any applicable statute of this state. All of the following apply for purposes of this subdivision:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The manufacturer is required to provide the new motor vehicle dealer, in writing, with its current uniformly applied requirements and criteria to be a dealer within 30 days of receiving the new motor vehicle dealer's written request for the uniformly applied requirements and criteria to be a dealer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Within 75 days after receiving the manufacturer's current uniformly applied written requirements and criteria to be a dealer from the manufacturer, the new motor vehicle dealer may submit a written request to the manufacturer for a meeting, in person or telephonically, with the manufacturer, under reasonable circumstances as agreed to by both parties, to address the requirements and criteria. The parties shall meet, in person or telephonically, within 45 days after the new motor vehicle dealer's request for a meeting, unless otherwise agreed. During the meeting, the manufacturer shall provide the dealer an opportunity to present, in writing, facts, data, and evidence that establish that there are factors beyond the reasonable control or influence of the new motor vehicle dealer that materially and adversely impact the proposed transferee's ability to meet the manufacturer's current uniformly applied written requirements to be a dealer. If the manufacturer does not provide the new motor vehicle dealer an opportunity to present, in writing, facts, data, and evidence, or does not in good faith evaluate the effect of the facts, data, and evidence presented by the dealer, then the manufacturer may not prohibit or prevent the new motor vehicle dealer from transferring the dealership to a spouse, child, or executive manager, or naming a spouse, child, or executive manager as the dealership successor to own and operate the dealership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The manufacturer must make any decision to decline the new motor vehicle dealer's request to transfer a new motor vehicle dealership to a spouse, child, or executive manager, or name a spouse, child, or executive manager as dealership successor, in good faith, including the opportunity for a meeting, in person or telephonically as provided in subparagraph (ii). If requested by the new motor vehicle dealer in writing, the manufacturer must provide the new motor vehicle dealer with the information that it relied on when concluding that the spouse, child, or executive manager did not satisfy the uniformly required requirements and criteria to be a new motor vehicle dealer. However, the manufacturer is not required to disclose proprietary or confidential information and is not required to disclose any information if disclosure is prohibited by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(aa) Make any material change in a dealer agreement without giving the new motor vehicle dealer written notice of the change at least 30 days before the effective date of the change. In any dispute under this subdivision, the new motor vehicle dealer has the burden of proving the modification is sufficiently significant and material to require notice under this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(bb) Unless otherwise agreed, require a new motor vehicle dealer to sell or offer to sell an extended service contract or extended maintenance plan offered, sold, backed by, or sponsored by the manufacturer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A manufacturer, either directly or through any subsidiary, shall not terminate, cancel, fail to renew, or discontinue any lease of a new motor vehicle dealer's established place of business except for a material breach of the lease.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Within 30 days after receiving a written request from the dealer, a manufacturer shall provide a new motor vehicle dealer that is seeking to sell, transfer, or exchange a new motor vehicle dealership with all forms generally utilized and requested by the manufacturer in connection with the sale, transfer, or exchange of a new motor vehicle dealership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A failure by a manufacturer or distributor to approve or disapprove a dealer's request to sell, transfer, or exchange its new motor vehicle dealership within the 75-day period after it receives a completed application, including all required documentation and information requested by the manufacturer or distributor, is considered approval by the manufacturer of the sale, transfer, or exchange of the dealership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) This section applies to a manufacturer that sells, services, displays, or advertises its new motor vehicles in this state.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A manufacturer may not charge a claim back to a new motor vehicle dealer after the claim is paid unless a representative of the manufacturer first meets in person or by video teleconference or telephone with an officer or employee of the dealer designated by the new motor vehicle dealer, or responds in writing to any dealer written request for information. All of the following apply if a meeting is held under this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) At the meeting, the manufacturer shall provide a detailed explanation, with supporting documentation, of the basis for each proposed chargeback of a claim to the dealer and a written statement containing the basis on which the claim or claims of the dealer were selected for audit or review by the manufacturer.

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>445.1577a Reasonable compensation for parts reimbursement and labor rates; factors.</B><P>Sec. 17a.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The principal factors in determining what constitutes reasonable compensation for parts reimbursement and labor rates for purposes of section 17(1) are as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The retail price charged for parts by other similarly situated new motor vehicle dealers in a comparable geographic area in this state that offer the same line-make of vehicles.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The retail labor rates of other similarly situated new motor vehicle dealers in a comparable geographic area in this state that offer the same line-make of vehicles.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) All of the following apply for purposes of subsection (1):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A new motor vehicle dealer that is demanding warranty compensation from a manufacturer at a rate that exceeds the agreed-upon rates shall establish the retail rate it customarily charges for parts by submitting to the manufacturer 100 consecutive and sequential nonwarranty customer-paid service repair orders that contain repairs for like services or all nonwarranty customer-paid service repair orders covering a period of 90 consecutive days, whichever is less. A dealer shall not submit a service repair order under this subsection that covers repairs made more than 180 days before the date of the submission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If a manufacturer determines from any set of repair orders submitted under subdivision (a) that the calculated retail markup rate for parts or the retail labor rate is substantially higher or lower than the rate currently on record with the manufacturer, the manufacturer may request additional documentation for a period of either 60 days before or 60 days after the time period for which the repair orders were submitted for purposes of an adjustment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A new motor vehicle dealer's retail rate percentage for parts is calculated by determining the dealer's total parts sales in the submitted repair orders and dividing that amount by the dealer's total cost for the purchase of those parts, subtracting 1 from that amount, and then multiplying by 100. The manufacturer must approve or disapprove the declared retail rate within 45 days after the date of submission by the dealer. The declared retail rate is effective beginning 30 days after approval by the manufacturer, unless the manufacturer disapproves and timely contests the dealer's declared rate. If a manufacturer fails to disapprove within 45 days following submission by the dealer, the declared retail rate is considered approved. A new motor vehicle dealer's retail rate for labor is calculated by determining the dealer's total labor sales from the submitted repair orders and dividing that amount by the total number of hours that generated those sales. The manufacturer must approve or disapprove the declared retail rate within 45 days after the date the dealer submits the repair orders. The declared retail labor rate is effective beginning 30 days after approval by the manufacturer, unless the manufacturer disapproves and timely contests the dealer's declared rate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A manufacturer may contest a new motor vehicle dealer's declared retail markup rate for parts or retail labor rate not later than 45 days after submission and declaration of the retail markup rate for parts or retail labor rate by the dealer by reasonably substantiating that the rate is inaccurate, incomplete, or unreasonable in light of the factors described in subsection (1). In contesting a new motor vehicle dealer's declared rate, a manufacturer shall provide a written explanation of the reasons for disagreement with the declared rate. If the declared retail markup rate for parts or retail labor rate is contested, then the manufacturer shall propose an adjustment of the rate. If the manufacturer contests the dealer's declared parts or labor rate, the parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute through an internal dispute resolution procedure of the manufacturer, if available, provided that the dispute resolution procedure occurs within a reasonable amount of time that does not exceed 45 days after notification of disagreement with the dealer's declared rate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If an internal dispute resolution procedure described in subdivision (d) is unsuccessful or does not occur in a timely manner, a new motor vehicle dealer may file a complaint in the circuit court for the county in which the new motor vehicle dealer is located, within 60 days after it receives the adjustment proposed by the manufacturer or within 30 days after conclusion of the internal dispute resolution procedure, whichever is later. In an action under this subdivision, the manufacturer has the burden of proof to demonstrate that the retail markup rate for parts or retail labor rate declared by the dealer is inaccurate, incomplete, or unreasonable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The following work shall not be considered in calculating the retail rate customarily charged by a new motor vehicle dealer for parts and labor under this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Repairs for manufacturer special events, specials, or promotional discounts for retail customer repairs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Parts sold at wholesale.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Routine maintenance not covered under any retail customer warranty, such as oil changes, fluids, filters, or belts not provided in the course of repairs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Nuts, bolts, or fasteners or similar items that do not have an individual part number.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Tires, tire repair, tire rotation, or other tire services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Vehicle reconditioning.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Installation or repair of accessories.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Repairs of vehicle body damage caused by a collision, a road hazard, the force of the elements, vandalism, or theft.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Vehicle emission or safety inspections required by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Manufacturer approved and reimbursed goodwill or policy repairs or replacements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) Repairs for which volume discounts have been negotiated with government agencies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a manufacturer furnishes a part or component to a new motor vehicle dealer to use in performing repairs under a recall, campaign service action, or warranty repair at no cost to the dealer, the manufacturer shall compensate the dealer for the authorized repair part or component in the same manner as warranty parts compensation under section 17 by paying the dealer the retail rate markup on the cost for the part or component as listed in the price schedule of the manufacturer less the cost for the part or component.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A manufacturer shall not require a new motor vehicle dealer to establish the retail rate customarily charged by the dealer for parts and labor by an unduly burdensome or time-consuming method or by requiring information that is unduly burdensome or time consuming to provide, including, but not limited to, part-by-part or transaction-by-transaction calculations. A dealer shall not declare a retail rate for parts or labor or both more than once in a calendar year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A manufacturer shall not limit access to sales or service promotion events, incentives, programs, or activities sponsored by the manufacturer or limit allocation of vehicles or parts to a new motor vehicle dealer based solely on the new motor vehicle dealer's exercise of its rights under this section. This subsection does not prohibit a manufacturer from increasing the price of a motor vehicle or part in the normal course of business.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A credit granting institution, unless otherwise prohibited by law, may charge an application fee uniform as to type of loan. If a credit granting institution includes appraisal in its written statement of reasons for rejection or variance or collects an application appraisal fee, then upon the request of a person making a loan application that is denied or the terms of which are varied and not accepted by the applicant, a credit granting institution shall provide the person, without additional charge, with a copy of the appraisal made in connection with the loan application. If an application appraisal fee is not collected, the copy may be made usable only for purposes related to this act. Copies of other completed forms, reports, and correspondence, except a credit report or correspondence pertaining to a credit report, used by the credit granting institution in reaching its decision shall be provided, on request and without charge, to a person making a loan application that is denied or the terms of which are varied and not accepted by the applicant.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Except for an error or omission that is a violation of this act, a credit granting institution is not liable to an applicant or any other person for an error or omission in an appraisal or other supporting documents made available to an applicant.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   If a person makes a loan inquiry relating to the prospects of obtaining a loan, the credit granting institution shall respond to the inquiry and shall send or cause to be delivered to the person making the inquiry a copy of the pamphlet or other documents prepared pursuant to subsection (10).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   Each credit granting institution shall make available for public distribution at the institution's principal office and each branch office or service center a pamphlet or document explaining in general terms the credit granting institution's criteria for the approval or denial of a loan application. The pamphlet or other document shall prominently state that a person has the right to make a loan inquiry and to file a written application for a mortgage loan or home improvement loan and to receive a written response to the application. A credit granting institution may use a separate pamphlet or document for mortgage loans and home improvement loans, and the pamphlet or document may contain additional material as well as the material required by this subsection. A copy of the pamphlet or other document shall be filed with the commissioner.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 3.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Before a sale or transfer of property securing a residential window period loan, which contains a due-on-sale clause, the following procedure shall be followed:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The borrower, or the proposed buyer or transferee, shall provide written notice to the lender of the proposed sale or transfer, which notice shall include the name and address of the proposed buyer or transferee and a copy of the agreement of sale or other document under which the sale or transfer shall occur.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Within 5 business days after receipt of the notice required under subdivision (a), the lender may require by written notice mailed or delivered to the proposed buyer or transferee that the proposed buyer or transferee either provide the credit information customarily required by the lender in connection with a credit application or complete the lender's customary credit application for a similar loan secured by similar property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Within 15 days after receipt of a written notice for credit information or for completion of the lender's customary credit application, the proposed buyer or transferee shall provide the credit information or complete the application as requested by the lender.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Within 20 days after receipt of the credit information or completion of the lender's customary credit application, the lender shall determine whether the proposed buyer or transferee meets the lender's customary credit standards for a similar loan secured by similar property, and shall notify the proposed buyer or transferee in writing, mailed or delivered, of the lender's decision and, in the event of disapproval, the reasons for the disapproval.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   If the lender is not in the business of making real property loans, then the determination to be made by the lender under subdivision (d) shall be whether the proposed buyer or transferee meets the credit standards customarily applied by major institutional residential lenders within the geographic market for similar loans secured by similar properties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A lender may charge a reasonable fee to determine whether a proposed buyer or transferee meets its customary credit standards, which fee shall be paid by the proposed buyer or transferee at the time of submission of the credit information or application required by subsection (1)(c). If the lender determines that the proposed buyer or transferee meets the lender's customary credit standards, the lender may charge the proposed buyer or transferee a loan processing fee in connection with and to be paid at the time of the amendment to the loan contract as provided in section 4. The total amount of the fees permitted by this subsection shall not exceed 1/2 of 1% of the outstanding balance of the residential window period loan plus the actual cost of an endorsement to the lender's policy of title insurance plus the actual cost of transfer of any private mortgage insurance. Other than the fees provided by this subsection, a lender shall not charge any amount for any reason for a transaction governed by sections 3 to 5.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as provided in section 6, a lender may enforce a due-on-sale clause in a residential window period loan if any of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The borrower and the proposed buyer or transferee fail to follow in a timely manner the procedures set forth in subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The proposed buyer or transferee fails to timely pay a fee charged by the lender under subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The lender, in good faith and in accordance with its customary procedures for evaluating creditworthiness, determines that the proposed buyer or transferee does not meet the lender's customary credit standards.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Enforcement is justified by a threat to a legitimate interest of the lender, which includes preventing the impairment or loss of the lender's security.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A lender shall not enforce a due-on-sale clause under either this section or section 4 in a residential window period loan if the lender fails to follow in a timely manner the procedures set forth in subsection (1).</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the lender is making fixed rate mortgage loans on similar types of property at the end of the blended rate period, the rate of interest at which the lender is making those loans.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the lender is not making fixed rate mortgage loans on similar types of property at the end of the blended rate period, the FHLBB mortgage index rate in effect on the last day of the blend rate period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the borrower accepts an offer to amend a loan as provided in subsection (1), during the blended rate period agreed to under subsection (1), there shall be monthly payments of principal and interest in an amount sufficient to repay the loan plus interest on the balance outstanding from time to time at the rate in effect during the blended rate period in equal monthly payments over the remaining original amortization period for the loan. At the end of the blended rate period, the monthly payments of principal and interest shall be adjusted to an amount sufficient to repay the loan plus interest on the balance outstanding from time to time at the rate effective after the blended rate period in equal monthly payments over the remaining original amortization period for the loan.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the borrower accepts an offer by a lender to amend a loan as provided in subsection (1), the amendment shall be executed and delivered at or before the sale or transfer, and shall be effective beginning on the date of the sale or transfer. If for reasons other than acts of the lender the amendment is not executed and delivered before the sale or transfer, then upon consummation of a sale or transfer the lender may enforce a due-on-sale clause. If the borrower amends the loan as provided in subsection (1), then upon consummation of the sale or transfer the lender shall not enforce a due-on-sale clause.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a loan contract is amended as contemplated by this section, the mortgage securing the loan shall retain the same lien priority which it had immediately prior to such amendment or extension.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Nothing in this act shall be construed to require a lender to extend the term of a residential real property loan.</DIV>

In the 1-year period beginning July 2, 1996, the operating fee shall be not less than $250.00 and not more than $2,500.00.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of section 19, if the commissioner determines that a licensee or registrant is, intentionally or as a result of gross or wanton negligence, not servicing mortgage loans in accordance with the terms of this act or the terms of the servicing contracts, the commissioner may appoint a conservator for the licensee or registrant and require of the conservator a bond and security as the commissioner considers proper. The commissioner may appoint as conservator 1 of the examiners of the bureau or some other competent and disinterested person. The bureau shall be reimbursed out of the assets of the conservatorship for actual expenses incurred by it in connection with the conservatorship. Amounts reimbursed shall be paid into the revolving fund provided for in subsection (4). Upon appointment under this subsection, a conservator shall become an employee of the bureau. All expenses of a conservatorship shall be paid out of the assets of the licensee or registrant, upon the approval of the commissioner. The expenses shall be a first charge upon the assets of the licensee or registrant and shall be fully paid before any final distribution or payment of dividends is made to creditors or shareholders.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The conservator, under the direction of the commissioner, shall take sole control of all the affairs of the licensee or registrant and possession of the books and records of the licensee or registrant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the licensee or registrant may cause the rights to service mortgage loans to be transferred or assigned to a person approved by the commissioner. The conservator of the licensee or registrant shall take such action as may be necessary to assure that the mortgage loans are serviced in accordance with the terms of this act and the servicing contracts.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the commissioner is satisfied that termination of the conservatorship may be done safely and is in the public interest, the commissioner may terminate the conservatorship and permit the licensee or registrant to resume the servicing of mortgage loans subject to any terms, conditions, and limitations as the commissioner may prescribe.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   All compensation and expenses required to be reimbursed to the financial institutions bureau in connection with a conservatorship and all expenses for state supervision of conservatorships under this act shall be deposited in the state treasury and shall be directed to a bureau revolving fund. Money in the fund and any interest earned shall only be disbursed on proper vouchers, approved by the commissioner, to reimburse the bureau for expenses incurred by the bureau in connection with conservators of licensees or registrants.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)   Used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(B)   At the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that his or her knowledge of the trade secret was derived from or through a person who had utilized improper means to acquire it, acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use, or derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person to maintain its secrecy or limit its use.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(C)   Before a material change of his or her position, knew or had reason to know that it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accident or mistake.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Actual or threatened misappropriation may be enjoined. Upon application to the court of competent jurisdiction, an injunction shall be terminated when the trade secret has ceased to exist, but the injunction may be continued for an additional reasonable period of time in order to eliminate commercial advantage that otherwise would be derived from the misappropriation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a court determines that it would be unreasonable to prohibit future use of a trade secret, an injunction may condition future use upon payment of a reasonable royalty for no longer than the period of time the use could have been prohibited.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In appropriate circumstances, affirmative acts to protect a trade secret may be compelled by court order.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Except to the extent that a material and prejudicial change of position prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation renders a monetary recovery inequitable, a complainant is entitled to recover damages for misappropriation. Damages can include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss. In lieu of damages measured by any other methods, the damages caused by misappropriation may be measured by imposition of liability for a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator's unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) To the extent that a tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow on account of units sold in the state in a particular year was greater than the master settlement agreement payments, as determined pursuant to section IX(i) of that agreement including after final determination of all adjustments, that such manufacturer would have been required to make on account of such units sold had it been a participating manufacturer, the excess shall be released from escrow and revert back to such tobacco product manufacturer.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) In the case of a second knowing violation, shall be prohibited from selling cigarettes to consumers within the state (whether directly or through a distributor, retailer, or similar intermediary) for a period not to exceed 2 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For purposes of subsection (5), each failure to make a quarterly or an annual deposit required under subsection (1)(b) shall constitute a separate violation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If, following a court determination described in subsection (4)(d), a court of competent jurisdiction determines that subsection (4) without subsection (4)(b) is unconstitutional, then this subsection applies. A tobacco product manufacturer that places funds into escrow pursuant to subsection (1)(b) shall receive the interest or other appreciation on the funds as earned. The funds themselves shall be released from escrow only under 1 or more of the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) To pay a judgment or settlement on any released claim brought against the tobacco product manufacturer by the state or any releasing party located or residing in the state. Funds shall be released from escrow under this subdivision in the order in which they were placed into escrow and only to the extent and at the time necessary to make payments required under such judgment or settlement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) To the extent that a tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow in a particular year was greater than the state's allocable share of the total payments that such manufacturer would have been required to make in that year under the master settlement agreement (as determined pursuant to section IX(i)(2) of the master settlement agreement, and before any of the adjustments or offsets described in section IX(i)(3) of the master settlement agreement other than the inflation adjustment) had it been a participating manufacturer, the excess shall be released from escrow and revert back to such tobacco product manufacturer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) To the extent not released from escrow under subdivision (a) or (b), funds shall be released from escrow and revert back to such tobacco product manufacturer 25 years after the date on which they were placed into escrow.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Notwithstanding subsection (4), a tobacco product manufacturer that elects to place funds into escrow pursuant to subsection (1)(b) may make an irrevocable assignment of its interest in the funds to the benefit of the state. Such assignment shall be permanent and apply to all funds in the subject escrow account or that may subsequently come into the account, including those deposited into the escrow account prior to the assignment being executed, those deposited into the escrow account after the assignment is executed, and interest or other appreciation on the funds. The tobacco product manufacturer, the Michigan department of treasury, and the financial institution where the escrow account is maintained may make such amendments to the qualified escrow account agreement as may be necessary to effectuate an assignment of rights executed pursuant to this subsection or a withdrawal of funds from the escrow account pursuant to subsection (4). An assignment of rights executed pursuant to this section shall be in writing, signed by a duly authorized representative of the tobacco products manufacturer making the assignment, and shall become effective upon delivery of the assignment to the Michigan department of treasury and the financial institution where the escrow account is maintained.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Notwithstanding subsection (4), any escrow funds assigned to the state pursuant to subsection (1)(a) shall be withdrawn by the state upon the request by the treasurer and approval of the attorney general. Any funds withdrawn pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited into the general fund and shall be calculated on a dollar-for-dollar basis as a credit against any judgment or settlement described in subsection (4) which may be obtained against the tobacco product manufacturer who has assigned the funds in the subject escrow account. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a tobacco product manufacturer from any past, current, or future obligations the manufacturer may have pursuant to this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If this act or any portion of 2003 PA 286 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional, the remaining portions of this act shall continue in full force and effect.</div>
