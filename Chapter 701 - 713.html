<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) In a direct placement, an individual seeking to adopt may request, at any time, that a preplacement assessment be prepared by a child placing agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An individual requesting a preplacement assessment does not need to have located a prospective adoptee when the request is made or when the assessment is completed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An individual may request more than 1 preplacement assessment or may request that an assessment, once initiated, not be completed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If an individual is seeking to adopt a child from a particular child placing agency, the agency may require the individual to be assessed by its own employee, even if the individual has already had a favorable preplacement assessment completed by another child placing agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A preplacement assessment is based upon personal interviews and visits at the residence of the individual being assessed, interviews of others who know the individual, and reports received under this subsection. The assessment shall contain all of the following information about the individual being assessed:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Age, nationality, race or ethnicity, and any religious preference.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Marital and family status and history, including the presence of other children or adults in the household and the relationship of those individuals to the adoptive parent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Physical and mental health, including any history of substance abuse.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Educational and employment history and any special skills and interests.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Property and income, including outstanding financial obligations as indicated in a current financial report provided by the individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Reason for wanting to adopt.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Any previous request for an assessment or involvement in an adoptive placement and the outcome of the assessment or placement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Whether the individual has ever been the respondent in a domestic violence proceeding or a proceeding concerning a child who was allegedly abused, dependent, deprived, neglected, abandoned, or delinquent, and the outcome of the proceeding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Whether the individual has ever been convicted of a crime.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Whether the individual has located a parent interested in placing a child with the individual for adoption and a brief description of the parent and the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) Any fact or circumstance that raises a specific concern about the suitability of the individual as an adoptive parent, including the quality of the environment in the home, the functioning of other children in the household, and any aspect of the individual's familial, social, psychological, or financial circumstances that may be relevant to a determination that the individual is not suitable. A specific concern is one that suggests that placement of any child, or a particular child, in the home of the individual would pose a risk of harm to the physical or psychological well-being of the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A child placing agency shall request an individual seeking a preplacement assessment to provide a document from the Michigan state police and the federal bureau of investigation describing all of the individual's criminal convictions as shown by that agency's records, or stating that the agency's records indicate that the individual has not been convicted of a crime. Upon request of the individual and receipt of a signed authorization, the child placing agency shall obtain the criminal record from the law enforcement agency on the individual's behalf.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A child placing agency shall request an individual seeking a preplacement assessment to undergo a physical examination conducted by a licensed physician, a licensed physician's assistant, or a certified nurse practitioner to determine that the individual is free from any known condition that would affect his or her ability to care for an adoptee. If an individual has had a physical examination within the 12 months immediately preceding his or her request for a preplacement assessment, he or she may submit a medical statement that is signed and dated by the licensed physician, licensed physician's assistant, or certified nurse practitioner verifying that he or she has had a physical examination within the previous 12-month period and is free from any known condition that would affect his or her ability to care for an adoptee. This subsection does not require new or additional third party reimbursement or worker's compensation benefits for services rendered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A preplacement assessment shall contain a list of the sources of information on which it is based. If the child placing agency determines that the information assessed does not raise a specific concern, the child placing agency shall find that the individual is suited to be an adoptive parent. If the child placing agency determines that the information assessed does raise a specific concern, the child placing agency shall find that the individual is not suitable to be an adoptive parent. The conclusion shall be supported by a written account of how 1 or more specific concerns pose a risk to the physical or psychological well-being of any child or a particular child. If the conclusion of a preplacement assessment regarding the suitability of the individual differs from the conclusion in a prior assessment, the child placing agency shall explain and justify the difference.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An individual who receives a preplacement assessment with a conclusion of unsuitability may seek a review of the assessment by the court after filing an adoption petition. The court may order an agent or employee of the court to make an investigation and report to the court before the hearing. If, at the hearing, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the conclusion of unsuitability is not justified, the person with legal custody of the child may place the child with that individual. If the court determines that the conclusion of unsuitability is justified, it shall order that the child shall not be placed with the individual.</div>

If an out-of-court release is signed under subsection (5), the adoption attorney representing the parent or guardian who witnessed the out-of-court release and a caseworker from the child placing agency that accepted the out-of-court release shall fully explain to the parent or guardian his or her legal rights and the fact that the parent or guardian by virtue of the out-of-court release voluntarily relinquishes permanently his or her rights to the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, upon the release of a child by a parent or guardian, the court immediately shall issue an order terminating the rights of that parent or guardian to that child. If an out-of-court release has been signed under subsection (5), not sooner than 5 days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the out-of-court release was signed, the court shall issue an order terminating the rights of the parent or guardian to that child. If the rights of both parents, the surviving parent, or the guardian have been terminated, the court shall issue an order committing the child to the child placing agency or department to which the release was given.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The court shall authorize foster care funding pending expiration of the period of appeal or rehearing as provided in sections 64 and 65 of this chapter, and pending disposition of any appeal or rehearing, for all persons committed to a child placing agency. Foster care funding authorized under this subsection shall exclude the administrative costs of the child placing agency. The costs of foster care shall be paid through the use of the child care fund as provided by section 117c of the social welfare act, 1939 PA 280, MCL 400.117c, or by any successor statute. When foster care funding is authorized according to this subsection, the court shall send a copy of the order to the department. Upon receiving a copy of this order, the department shall reimburse the court child care fund of the county where the court order for foster care funding was made in the total amount of the court ordered payment. The reimbursement shall be made monthly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Entry of an order terminating the rights of both parents under subsection (8) terminates the jurisdiction of the circuit court over the child in any divorce or separate maintenance action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (12), upon petition of the same person or persons who executed the release and of the department or child placing agency to which the child was released, the court with which the release was filed may grant a hearing to consider whether the release should be revoked. A release may not be revoked if the child has been placed for adoption unless the child is placed as provided in section 41(2) of this chapter and a petition for rehearing or claim of appeal is filed within the time required. A verbatim record of testimony related to a petition to revoke a release shall be made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a parent or guardian who has signed an out-of-court release but wishes to request revocation of the out-of-court release shall submit a request for revocation to the adoption attorney representing the parent or guardian or the child placing agency that accepted the out-of-court release not more than 5 days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the out-of-court release was signed. The request for revocation from the parent or guardian must be submitted in writing by the parent or guardian who signed the out-of-court release to the adoption attorney representing the parent or guardian or a caseworker from the child placing agency that accepted the out-of-court release. The request for revocation is timely if delivered to the adoption attorney or the child placing agency not more than 5 days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the out-of-court release was signed. Upon receipt of a timely request for revocation, the adoption attorney or the child placing agency receiving the request for revocation shall assist the parent or guardian in filing the petition to revoke the out-of-court release with the court as soon as practicable. A parent or guardian may file this petition with the court on his or her own. If the parent or guardian files the petition on his or her own, the petition must be filed with the court not more than 5 days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the out-of-court release was signed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The court in which the out-of-court release was filed may deny the request for revocation under subsection (14).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) If a petition to revoke an out-of-court release is filed with the court, timely notice of revocation does not immediately result in the return of the child to the parent or guardian. A hearing before a judge is required to determine all of the following unless a child placing agency accepting the out-of-court release or the adoptive parent or parents agree to the revocation:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Whether the request for revocation was given in a timely and proper manner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Whether good cause exists to determine that the out-of-court release was not signed voluntarily. If the court finds that the out-of-court release was not signed voluntarily, the out-of-court release is invalid and custody of the child shall be returned to the parent or guardian. If the court finds that the out-of-court release was signed voluntarily, the court shall proceed under subdivision (c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Whether the best interest of the child will be served by any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Returning custody of the child to the parent or guardian.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Continuing the adoption proceeding commenced or intended to be commenced by the adoptive parent or parents.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Disposition appropriate to the child's welfare as authorized by section 18 of chapter XIIA under an ex parte order entered by the court.</div>

<P>Sec. 33.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Before the birth of a child born out of wedlock, a person claiming under oath to be the father of the child may file a verified notice of intent to claim paternity with the court in any county of this state. The form of the notice shall be prescribed by the director of the department of public health and provided to the court. The notice shall include the claimant's address. On the next business day after receipt of the notice the court shall transmit the notice to the vital records division of the department of public health.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A person filing a notice of intent to claim paternity shall be presumed to be the father of the child for purposes of this chapter unless the mother denies that the claimant is the father. Such a notice is admissible in a paternity proceeding under Act No. 205 of the Public Acts of 1956, as amended, being sections 722.711 to 722.730 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, and shall create a rebuttable presumption as to the paternity of that child for purposes of that act.

<P>Sec. 34.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In order to provide due notice at the earliest possible time to a putative father who may have an interest in the custody of an expected child or in the mother's intended release of an expected child for adoption or consent to adoption of the expected child, and in order to facilitate early placement of a child for adoption, a woman pregnant out of wedlock may file with the court an ex parte petition which evidences her intent to release her expected child for adoption or to consent to the child's adoption, which indicates the approximate date and location of conception and the expected date of her confinement, which alleges that a particular person is the putative father of her expected child, and which requests the court to notify the putative father about his rights to file a notice of intent to claim paternity pursuant to section 33. The petition may allege more than 1 putative father where circumstances warrant. The petition shall be verified. Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall issue a notice of intent to release or consent, which notice shall be served upon the putative father by any officer or person authorized to serve process of the court. Proof of service shall be filed with the court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A notice of intent to release or consent shall:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Inform the putative father of the rights to which his filing of a notice of intent to claim paternity will entitle him under section 33(3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Inform the putative father that his failure to file a notice of intent to claim paternity before the expected date of confinement or before the birth of the child, whichever is later, shall constitute a waiver of his right to receive the notice to which he would otherwise be entitled under section 33(3) and shall constitute a denial of his interest in custody of the child, which denial shall result in the court's termination of his rights to the child.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The form of the notice of intent to release or consent shall be approved by the supreme court administrator and shall be consistent with this section.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a child is claimed to be born out of wedlock and the mother executes or proposes to execute a release or consent relinquishing her rights to the child or joins in a petition for adoption filed by her spouse, and the release or consent of the natural father cannot be obtained, the judge shall hold a hearing as soon as practical to determine whether the child was born out of wedlock, to determine the identity of the father, and to determine or terminate the rights of the father as provided in this section and sections 37 and 39 of this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Proof of service of a notice of intent to release or consent or the putative father's verified acknowledgment of notice of intent to release or consent shall be filed with the court, if the notice was given to the putative father.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the court has proof that the person whom it determines pursuant to section 36 to be the father of the child was timely served with a notice of intent to release or consent pursuant to section 34(1) or was served with or waived the notice of hearing required by section 36(3), the court may permanently terminate the rights of the putative father under any of the following circumstances:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The putative father submits a verified affirmation of his paternity and a denial of his interest in custody of the child.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The putative father files a disclaimer of paternity. For purposes of this section the filing of the disclaimer of paternity shall constitute a waiver of notice of hearing and shall constitute a denial of his interest in custody of the child.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The putative father was served with a notice of intent to release or consent in accordance with section 34(1), at least 30 days before the expected date of confinement specified in that notice but failed to file an intent to claim paternity either before the expected date of confinement or before the birth of the child.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The putative father is given proper notice of hearing in accordance with section 36(3) or 36(5) but either fails to appear at the hearing or appears and denies his interest in custody of the child.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the putative father does not come within the provisions of subsection (2), and if the putative father appears at the hearing and requests custody of the child, the court shall inquire into his fitness and his ability to properly care for the child and shall determine whether the best interests of the child will be served by granting custody to him.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) I have not been given or promised any money or other thing of value in exchange for signing the out-of-court consent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) If I sign the out-of-court consent, I understand that I am giving up all of my parental rights and authorizing the court to permanently terminate all of my parental rights, unless the court allows me to revoke my out-of-court consent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) It has been explained to me and I understand all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) I am not required to sign an out-of-court consent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) I may make a temporary placement of my child with the prospective adoptive parent or parents, if I have not already done so, or I may continue the temporary placement I have already made, until I choose to sign a consent in court or sign an out-of-court consent. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(C) I may request revocation of the out-of-court consent I have signed by submitting a timely written request for revocation. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(D) If I request a revocation of the out-of-court consent, I must appear before the court so the court may consider whether to grant the revocation. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) I have been advised that I may submit a request for revocation in writing to the adoption attorney or child placing agency that witnessed the out-of-court consent not more than 5 days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the out-of-court consent was signed or I may petition the court on my own for revocation of the out-of-court consent not more than 5 days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the out-of-court consent was signed. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vii) If I submit a timely request for revocation, the court may grant the request or deny the request for revocation depending on my fitness and immediate ability to properly care for the child and whether the best interests of the child would be served by the revocation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The out-of-court consent must contain the contact information for both the adoption attorney representing the parent or guardian and the child placing agency that witnessed the out-of-court consent specifying where a written request for revocation may be submitted, including a postal mailing address, overnight carrier address, fax number, and electronic mail address.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The out-of-court consent may be signed before filing a petition for adoption.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a parent or guardian who has signed an out-of-court consent but wishes to request revocation of the out-of-court consent shall submit a request for revocation to the adoption attorney representing the parent or guardian or the child placing agency that witnessed the out-of-court consent not more than 5 days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the out-of-court consent was signed. The request for revocation from the parent or guardian must be submitted in writing by the parent or guardian who signed the out-of-court consent to the adoption attorney representing the parent or guardian or a caseworker from the child placing agency that witnessed the out-of-court consent. The request for revocation is timely if delivered to the adoption attorney or a caseworker from the child placing agency not more than 5 days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the out-of-court consent was signed. Upon receipt of a timely request for revocation, the adoption attorney or the child placing agency receiving the request for revocation shall assist the parent or guardian in filing the petition to revoke the out-of-court consent with the court as soon as practicable. A parent or guardian may file this petition with the court on his or her own. If the parent or guardian files the petition on his or her own, the petition must be filed with the court not more than 5 days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the out-of-court consent was signed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The court in which the out-of-court consent was filed may deny the request for revocation under subsections (11) and (12).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If a petition to revoke an out-of-court consent has been filed with the court, timely notice of revocation does not immediately result in the return of the child to the parent or guardian. A hearing before a judge is required to determine all of the following unless the adoptive parent or parents agree to the revocation:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Whether the request for revocation was given in a timely and proper manner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Whether good cause exists to determine that the out-of-court consent was not signed voluntarily. If the court finds that the out-of-court consent was not signed voluntarily, the out-of-court consent is invalid and custody of the child shall be returned to the parent or guardian. If the court finds that the out-of-court consent was signed voluntarily, the court shall proceed under subdivision (c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Whether the best interest of the child will be served by any of the following: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Returning custody of the child to the parent or guardian.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Continuing the adoption proceeding commenced or intended to be commenced by the adoptive parent or parents.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Disposition appropriate to the child's welfare as authorized by section 18 of chapter XIIA under an ex parte order entered by the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) In determining the best interest of the child under subsection (11)(c), if a parent or guardian is seeking revocation of an out-of-court consent, the court shall determine if the parent or guardian seeking revocation is fit and immediately able to properly care for the child if the court returned the child to the parent or guardian. If the court determines that the parent or guardian is not fit and immediately able to properly care for the child, the court shall deny the revocation. If the court finds that the parent or guardian is fit and immediately able to properly care for the child, the court shall determine the best interest of the child. The "best interest of the child" means the sum total of the following factors to be considered, evaluated, and determined by the court:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The child's age and length of time the parent or guardian seeking revocation has had physical custody of the child so that significant love, affection, and other emotional ties exist between the parent or guardian and the child and whether during that time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The capacity and disposition of the prospective adopting individual or individuals and the parent or guardian seeking revocation to give the child love, affection, and guidance, and to educate and create a milieu that fosters the child's religion, racial identity, and culture.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The capacity and disposition of the prospective adopting individual or individuals and the parent or guardian seeking revocation to provide the child with food, clothing, education, permanence, medical care or other remedial care recognized and permitted under the state law in place of medical care, and other material needs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The permanence as a family unit of the prospective adopting individual or individuals and the parent or guardian seeking revocation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The moral fitness of the prospective adopting individual or individuals and the parent or guardian seeking revocation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The mental and physical health of the prospective adopting individual or individuals and the parent or guardian seeking revocation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The home, school, and community record of the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The child's reasonable preference, if the child is 14 years of age or less and if the court considers the child to be of sufficient age to express a preference.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The ability and willingness of the prospective adopting individual or individuals to adopt the child's siblings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) Any other factor considered by the court to be relevant to a particular prospective adoptive placement or to a revocation of an out-of-court consent.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Not later than 14 days after receipt of the report of investigation, except as provided in subsections (2) and (5), the judge shall examine the report and shall enter an order terminating the rights of the child's parent or parents, if there was a parental consent, or the rights of any person in loco parentis, if there was a consent by other than parents, and approve placement of the child with the petitioner if the judge is satisfied as to both of the following:</div>

Before placement of the child in that instance, the sending agency shall tender evidence as the court requires to demonstrate that the agency possesses the necessary authority to consent to the adoption at the time of entry of the final order of adoption. After the sending agency has given evidence of its ability to consent, the agency shall not do anything to jeopardize its ability to grant the required consent before entry of the final order of adoption.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An adult adoptee, an adoptive parent of a minor adoptee, or an adult child of a deceased adoptee may petition the court in which the final order of adoption was entered to appoint a confidential intermediary to search for and contact a former family member. A former family member may petition the court in which the final order of adoption was entered to appoint a confidential intermediary to search for and contact an adult adoptee or an adult child of a deceased adoptee. Upon receipt of a petition under this section, the court shall contact the central adoption registry to determine whether there is currently on file a statement from the individual being sought that denies consent to the release of identifying information. If no denial of consent is currently on file for that individual, the court shall by written order appoint as confidential intermediary an individual who meets the requirements of subsection (3). The court shall provide the confidential intermediary with a certified copy of the order of appointment. The court may dismiss an intermediary if the intermediary engages in conduct that violates professional or ethical standards.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   "I, .............., signing under penalty of perjury, affirm all of the following:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   I will conduct a reasonable search for an individual being sought. I will make a discreet and confidential inquiry as to whether the individual consents to the release of information to the petitioner, or to meeting or communicating with the petitioner, and I will report to the petitioner and the court the results of my search and inquiry.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If the petitioner and the individual being sought consent in writing to meet or communicate with each other, I will act in accordance with the instructions of those persons and, if applicable, the instructions of the court to facilitate any meeting or communication between them.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   I will not charge or accept any fee for my services except for reimbursement from the petitioner for actual expenses incurred in performing my services, or as authorized by the court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   I recognize that I may be subject to contempt of court sanctions and dismissal by the court if I permit the release of confidential information without authorization.".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A confidential intermediary shall make a reasonable search for an individual whose identity is sought by a petitioner under this section. The confidential intermediary shall first search the court records. If it is necessary to obtain information from an agency or the department, the confidential intermediary shall provide a certified copy of the order of appointment to the agency or the department before requesting the records. If the confidential intermediary locates the individual being sought, the intermediary shall discreetly and confidentially contact the individual to ascertain whether the individual is willing to release information to the petitioner or to meet or communicate with the petitioner. If the individual consents in writing to the release of information, the intermediary shall release the information to the petitioner.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The family division of the circuit court for a county may enter an order to change the name of an individual who has been a resident of the county for not less than 1 year and who in accordance with subsection (2) petitions in writing to the court for that purpose showing a sufficient reason for the proposed change and that the change is not sought with a fraudulent intent. If the individual who petitions for a name change has a criminal record, the individual is presumed to be seeking a name change with a fraudulent intent. The burden of proof is on a petitioner who has a criminal record to rebut the presumption. The court shall set a time and place for hearing and, except as provided in section 3 of this chapter, order publication as provided by supreme court rule.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An individual who is 22 years of age or older and who petitions to have his or her name changed shall have 2 complete sets of his or her fingerprints taken at a local police agency. The fingerprints, along with a copy of the petition and the required processing fees, must be forwarded to the department of state police. The department of state police shall compare those fingerprints with its records and shall forward a complete set of fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a comparison with the records available to that agency. The department of state police shall report to the court in which the petition is filed the information contained in the department's records with respect to any pending charges against the petitioner or a record of conviction of the petitioner and shall report to the court similar information obtained from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. If there are no pending charges or record of conviction against the petitioner, the department of state police shall destroy its copy of the petitioner's fingerprints. The court shall not act upon the petition for a name change until the department of state police reports the information required by this subsection to the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the court enters an order to change the name of an individual who has a criminal record, the court shall forward the order to the central records division of the department of state police and to 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The department of corrections if the individual named in the order is in prison or on parole or has been imprisoned or released from parole in the immediately preceding 2 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The sheriff of the county in which the individual named in the order was last convicted if the individual was incarcerated in a county jail or released from a county jail within the immediately preceding 2 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The court that has jurisdiction over the individual named in the order if the individual named in the order is under the jurisdiction of the family division of the circuit court or has been discharged from the jurisdiction of that court within the immediately preceding 2 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The court may permit an individual having the same name, or a similar name to that which the petitioner proposes to assume, to intervene in the proceeding for the purpose of showing fraudulent intent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as provided in subsection (7), if the petitioner is a minor, the petition must be signed by the mother and father jointly; by the surviving parent if 1 is deceased; if both parents are deceased, by the guardian of the minor; or by 1 of the minor's parents if there is only 1 legal parent available to give consent. If either parent has been declared mentally incompetent, the petition may be signed by the guardian for that parent. The written consent to the change of name of a minor 14 years of age or older, signed by the minor in the presence of the court, must be filed with the court before an order changing the name of the minor is entered. If the court considers the child to be of sufficient age to express a preference, the court shall consult a minor under 14 years of age as to a change in his or her name, and the court shall consider the minor's wishes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the petitioner is married, the court, in its order changing the name of the petitioner, may include the name of the spouse, if the spouse consents, and may include the names of minor children of the petitioner of whom the petitioner has legal custody. The written consent to the change of name of a child 14 years of age or older, signed by the child in the presence of the court, must be filed with the court before the court includes that child in its order. Except as provided in subsection (7), the name of a minor under 14 years of age may not be changed unless he or she is the natural or adopted child of the petitioner and unless consent is obtained from the mother and father jointly, from the surviving parent if 1 is deceased, or from 1 of the minor's parents if there is only 1 legal parent available to give consent. If the court considers the child to be of sufficient age to express a preference, the court shall consult a minor under 14 years of age as to a change in his or her name, and the court shall consider the minor's wishes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The name of a minor may be changed pursuant to subsection (5) or (6) with the consent or signature of the custodial parent upon notice to the noncustodial parent as provided in supreme court rule and after a hearing in any of the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If both of the following occur:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The other parent, having the ability to support or assist in supporting the child, has failed or neglected to provide regular and substantial support for the child or, if a support order has been entered, has failed to substantially comply with the order, for 2 years or more before the filing of the petition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The other parent, having the ability to visit, contact, or communicate with the child, has regularly and substantially failed or neglected to do so for 2 years or more before the filing of the petition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The other parent has been convicted of a violation of section 136b, 520b, 520c, 520d, 520e, or 520g of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.136b, 750.520b to 750.520e, and 750.520g, and the child or a sibling of the child is a victim of the crime.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The other parent has been convicted of a violation of section 316 or 317 of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.316 and 750.317.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A false statement that is intentionally included within a petition for a name change constitutes perjury under section 422 of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.422.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) In a petition or amended petition alleging that a juvenile is within the court's jurisdiction under section 2(a)(1) of this chapter for a specified juvenile violation, the prosecuting attorney may designate the case as a case in which the juvenile is to be tried in the same manner as an adult. An amended petition making a designation under this subsection must be filed only by leave of the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In a petition alleging that a juvenile is within the court's jurisdiction under section 2(a)(1) of this chapter for an offense other than a specified juvenile violation, the prosecuting attorney may request that the court designate the case as a case in which the juvenile is to be tried in the same manner as an adult. The court may designate the case following a hearing if it determines that the best interests of the juvenile and the public would be served by the juvenile being tried in the same manner as an adult. In determining whether the best interests of the juvenile and the public would be served, the court shall consider all of the following factors, giving greater weight to the seriousness of the alleged offense and the juvenile's prior delinquency record than to the other factors:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The seriousness of the alleged offense in terms of community protection, including, but not limited to, the existence of any aggravating factors recognized by the sentencing guidelines, the use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon, and the impact on any victim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The juvenile's culpability in committing the alleged offense, including, but not limited to, the level of the juvenile's participation in planning and carrying out the offense and the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors recognized by the sentencing guidelines.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The juvenile's prior record of delinquency including, but not limited to, any record of detention, any police record, any school record, or any other evidence indicating prior delinquent behavior.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The juvenile's programming history, including, but not limited to, the juvenile's past willingness to participate meaningfully in available programming.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The adequacy of the punishment or programming available in the juvenile justice system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The dispositional options available for the juvenile.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a case is designated under this section, the case must be set for trial in the same manner as the trial of an adult in a court of general criminal jurisdiction unless a probable cause hearing is required under subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the petition in a case designated under this section alleges an offense that if committed by an adult would be a felony or punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year, the court shall conduct a probable cause hearing not later than 14 days after the case is designated to determine whether there is probable cause to believe the offense was committed and whether there is probable cause to believe the juvenile committed the offense. This hearing may be combined with the designation hearing under subsection (2) for an offense other than a specified juvenile offense. A probable cause hearing under this section is the equivalent of the preliminary examination in a court of general criminal jurisdiction and satisfies the requirement for that hearing. A probable cause hearing must be conducted by a judge other than the judge who will try the case if the juvenile is tried in the same manner as an adult.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the court determines there is probable cause to believe the offense alleged in the petition was committed and probable cause to believe the juvenile committed the offense, the case must be set for trial in the same manner as the trial of an adult in a court of general criminal jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the court determines that an offense did not occur or there is not probable cause to believe the juvenile committed the offense, the court shall dismiss the petition. If the court determines there is probable cause to believe another offense was committed and there is probable cause to believe the juvenile committed that offense, the court may further determine whether the case should be designated as a case in which the juvenile should be tried in the same manner as an adult as provided in subsection (2). If the court designates the case, the case must be set for trial in the same manner as the trial of an adult in a court of general criminal jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a case is designated under this section, the proceedings are criminal proceedings and must afford all procedural protections and guarantees to which the juvenile would be entitled if being tried for the offense in a court of general criminal jurisdiction. A plea of guilty or nolo contendere or a verdict of guilty must result in entry of a judgment of conviction. The conviction must have the same effect and liabilities as if it had been obtained in a court of general criminal jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Following a judgment of conviction, the court shall enter a disposition or impose a sentence authorized under section 18(1)(p) of this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) As used in this section, "specified juvenile violation" means any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A violation of section 72, 83, 86, 89, 91, 316, 317, 349, 520b, 529, 529a, or 531 of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.72, 750.83, 750.86, 750.89, 750.91, 750.316, 750.317, 750.349, 750.520b, 750.529, 750.529a, and 750.531.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A knife, stabbing instrument, brass knuckles, blackjack, club, or other object specifically designed or customarily carried or possessed for use as a weapon.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) An object that is likely to cause death or bodily injury when used as a weapon and that is used as a weapon or carried or possessed for use as a weapon.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) An object or device that is used or fashioned in a manner to lead a person to believe the object or device is an object or device described in subparagraphs (i) to (iii).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A violation of section 186a of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.186a, regarding escape or attempted escape from a juvenile facility, but only if the juvenile facility from which the juvenile escaped or attempted to escape was 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A high-security or medium-security facility operated by the family independence agency or a county juvenile agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A high-security facility operated by a private agency under contract with the family independence agency or a county juvenile agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A violation of section 7401(2)(a)(i) or 7403(2)(a)(i) of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7401 and 333.7403.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) An attempt to commit a violation described in subdivisions (a) to (d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Conspiracy to commit a violation described in subdivisions (a) to (d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Solicitation to commit a violation described in subdivisions (a) to (d).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Any other offense arising out of the same transaction as an offense described in subdivisions (a) to (g) if the juvenile is alleged in the petition to have committed an offense described in subdivisions (a) to (g).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the court determines that formal jurisdiction should not be acquired over a juvenile, the court may proceed in an informal manner referred to as a consent calendar.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A case shall not be placed on the consent calendar unless the juvenile and the parent, guardian, or legal custodian and the prosecutor agree to have the case placed on the consent calendar.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The court may transfer a case from the formal calendar to the consent calendar at any time before disposition. A case involving the alleged commission of an offense as that term is defined in section 31 of the William Van Regenmorter crime victim's rights act, 1985 PA 87, MCL 780.781, shall only be placed on the consent calendar upon compliance with the procedures set forth in section 36b of the William Van Regenmorter crime victim's rights act, 1985 PA 87, MCL 780.786b.</div>

However, consent calendar case records shall not be disclosed to federal agencies or military recruiters. For purposes of this subsection, "case records" includes the pleadings, motions, authorized petitions, notices, memoranda, briefs, exhibits, available transcripts, findings of the court, register of actions, consent calendar case plan, and court orders related to the case placed on the consent calendar.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The contents of the confidential file, as defined in MCR 3.903, shall continue to be maintained confidentially.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The court shall conduct a consent calendar conference with the juvenile, the juvenile's attorney, if any, and the juvenile's parent, guardian, or legal custodian to discuss the allegations. The prosecuting attorney and victim may be, but are not required to be, present.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If it appears to the court that the juvenile has engaged in conduct that would subject the juvenile to the jurisdiction of the court, the court shall issue a written consent calendar case plan. All of the following apply to a consent calendar case plan:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The plan may include a provision requiring the juvenile, parent, guardian, or legal custodian to reimburse the court for the cost of the consent calendar services for the juvenile. The reimbursement amount shall be reasonable, taking into account the juvenile's income and resources. The plan shall also include a requirement that the juvenile pay restitution under the William Van Regenmorter crime victim's rights act, 1985 PA 87, MCL 780.751 to 780.834.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A consent calendar case plan shall not contain a provision removing the juvenile from the custody of the juvenile's parent, guardian, or legal custodian.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The consent calendar case plan is not an order of the court, but shall be included as a part of the case record.</div>

As used in this subdivision, "case records" includes the pleadings, motions, authorized petitions, notices, memoranda, briefs, exhibits, available transcripts, findings of the court, register of actions, consent calendar case plan, risk screening tool and mental health screening tool results, and court orders related to the case placed on the consent calendar.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The contents of the confidential file must continue to be maintained confidentially. As used in this subdivision, "confidential file" means that term as defined in MCR 3.903.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A risk screening tool and a mental health screening tool conducted as part of a proceeding under this section and any information obtained from a juvenile in the course of those screenings or provided by the juvenile in order to participate in a consent calendar case plan, including, but not limited to, any admission, confession, or incriminating evidence, are not admissible into evidence in any adjudicatory hearing in which the juvenile is accused and are not subject to subpoena or any other court process for use in any other proceeding or for any other purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The court shall conduct a consent calendar conference with the juvenile, the juvenile's attorney, if any, and the juvenile's parent, guardian, or legal custodian to discuss the allegations.

The court shall not order the juvenile or the juvenile's parent, guardian, or legal custodian to pay for fees or costs associated with consent calendar services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A consent calendar case plan must not contain a provision removing the juvenile from the custody of the juvenile's parent, guardian, or legal custodian.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The period for a juvenile to complete the terms of a consent calendar case plan must not exceed 3 months, unless the court determines that a longer period is needed for the juvenile to complete a specific treatment program and includes this determination as part of the consent calendar case record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The consent calendar case plan is not an order of the court, but must be included as a part of the case record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Violation of the terms of the consent calendar case plan may result in the court's returning the case to the formal calendar for further proceedings consistent with subsection (12).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The court shall not enter an order of disposition in a case while it is on the consent calendar.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a juvenile 14 years of age or older is accused of an act that if committed by an adult would be a felony, the judge of the family division of circuit court in the county in which the offense is alleged to have been committed may waive jurisdiction under this section upon motion of the prosecuting attorney. After waiver, the juvenile may be tried in the court having general criminal jurisdiction of the offense.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Before conducting a hearing on the motion to waive jurisdiction, the court shall give notice of the hearing in the manner provided by supreme court rule to the juvenile and the prosecuting attorney and, if addresses are known, to the juvenile's parents or guardians. The notice shall state clearly that a waiver of jurisdiction to a court of general criminal jurisdiction has been requested and that, if granted, the juvenile can be prosecuted for the alleged offense as though he or she were an adult.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Before the court waives jurisdiction, the court shall determine on the record if there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed that if committed by an adult would be a felony and if there is probable cause to believe that the juvenile committed the offense. Before a juvenile may waive a probable cause hearing under this subsection, the court shall inform the juvenile that a waiver of this subsection waives the preliminary examination required by chapter VI of the code of criminal procedure, Act No. 175 of the Public Acts of 1927, being sections 766.1 to 766.18 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Upon a showing of probable cause under subsection (3), the court shall conduct a hearing to determine if the best interests of the juvenile and the public would be served by granting a waiver of jurisdiction to the court of general criminal jurisdiction. In making its determination, the court shall consider all of the following criteria, giving greater weight to the seriousness of the alleged offense and the juvenile's prior record of delinquency than to the other criteria:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The seriousness of the alleged offense in terms of community protection, including, but not limited to, the existence of any aggravating factors recognized by the sentencing guidelines, the use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon, and the impact on any victim.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The culpability of the juvenile in committing the alleged offense, including, but not limited to, the level of the juvenile's participation in planning and carrying out the offense and the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors recognized by the sentencing guidelines.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The juvenile's prior record of delinquency including, but not limited to, any record of detention, any police record, any school record, or any other evidence indicating prior delinquent behavior.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The juvenile's programming history, including, but not limited to, the juvenile's past willingness to participate meaningfully in available programming.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The adequacy of the punishment or programming available in the juvenile justice system.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The dispositional options available for the juvenile.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the court determines that there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed that if committed by an adult would be a felony and that the juvenile committed the offense, the court shall waive jurisdiction of the juvenile if the court finds that the juvenile has previously been subject to the jurisdiction of the circuit court under this section or section 606 of the revised judicature act of 1961, Act No. 236 of the Public Acts of 1961, being section 600.606 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, or the recorder's court of the city of Detroit under this section or section 10a(1)(c) of Act No. 369 of the Public Acts of 1919, being section 725.10a of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If legal counsel has not been retained or appointed to represent the juvenile, the court shall advise the juvenile and his or her parents, guardian, custodian, or guardian ad litem of the juvenile's right to representation and appoint legal counsel. If the court appoints legal counsel, the judge may assess the cost of providing legal counsel as costs against the juvenile or those responsible for his or her support, or both, if the persons to be assessed are financially able to comply.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Legal counsel shall have access to records or reports provided and received by the judge as a basis for decision in proceedings for waiver of jurisdiction. A continuance shall be granted at legal counsel's request if any report, information, or recommendation not previously available is introduced or developed at the hearing and the interests of justice require a continuance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The court shall enter a written order either granting or denying the motion to waive jurisdiction and the court shall state on the record or in a written opinion the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law forming the basis for entering the order. If a juvenile is waived, a transcript of the court's findings or a copy of the written opinion shall be sent to the court of general criminal jurisdiction. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   If the court does not waive jurisdiction, a transcript of the court's findings or, if a written opinion is prepared, a copy of the written opinion shall be sent to the prosecuting attorney, juvenile, or juvenile's attorney upon request.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   If the court waives jurisdiction, the juvenile shall be arraigned on an information filed by the prosecutor in the court of general criminal jurisdiction. The probable cause finding under subsection (3) satisfies the requirements of, and is the equivalent of, the preliminary examination required by chapter VI of Act No. 175 of the Public Acts of 1927.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   As used in this section, "felony" means an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year or an offense designated by law as a felony.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 17.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The court may conduct a hearing other than a criminal hearing in an informal manner. The court shall require stenographic notes or another transcript to be taken of the hearing. The court shall adjourn a hearing or grant a continuance regarding a case under section 2(b) of this chapter only for good cause with factual findings on the record and not solely upon stipulation of counsel or for the convenience of a party. In addition to a factual finding of good cause, the court shall not adjourn the hearing or grant a continuance unless 1 of the following is also true:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The motion for the adjournment or continuance is made in writing not less than 14 days before the hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The court grants the adjournment or continuance upon its own motion after taking into consideration the child's best interests. An adjournment or continuance granted under this subdivision shall not last more than 28 days unless the court states on the record the specific reasons why a longer adjournment or continuance is necessary.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, in a hearing other than a criminal trial under this chapter, a person interested in the hearing may demand a jury of 6 individuals, or the court, on its own motion, may order a jury of 6 individuals to try the case. In a proceeding under section 2(h) of this chapter, a jury shall not be demanded or ordered on a supplemental petition alleging a violation of a personal protection order. In a criminal trial, a jury may be demanded as provided by law. The jury shall be summoned and impaneled in accordance with chapter 13 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.1300 to 600.1376, and, in the case of a criminal trial, as provided in chapter VIII of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 768.1 to 768.36.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A parent, guardian, or other custodian of a juvenile held under this chapter has the right to give bond or other security for the appearance of the juvenile at the hearing of the case.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The prosecuting attorney shall appear for the people when requested by the court, and in a proceeding under section 2(a)(1) of this chapter, the prosecuting attorney shall appear if the proceeding requires a hearing and the taking of testimony.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   In a proceeding under section 2(b) of this chapter, upon request of the family independence agency or an agent of the family independence agency under contract with the family independence agency, the prosecuting attorney shall serve as a legal consultant to the family independence agency or its agent at all stages of the proceeding. If in a proceeding under section 2(b) of this chapter the prosecuting attorney does not appear on behalf of the family independence agency or its agent, the family independence agency may contract with an attorney of its choice for legal representation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A member of a local foster care review board established under 1984 PA 422, MCL 722.131 to 722.139a, shall be admitted to a hearing under subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Upon motion of a party or a victim, the court may close the hearing of a case brought under this chapter to members of the general public during the testimony of a juvenile witness or the victim if the court finds that closing the hearing is necessary to protect the welfare of the juvenile witness or the victim. In determining whether closing the hearing is necessary to protect the welfare of the juvenile witness or the victim, the court shall consider the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The age of the juvenile witness or the victim.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The nature of the proceeding.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The desire of the juvenile witness, of the witness's family or guardian, or of the victim to have the testimony taken in a room closed to the public.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) In a proceeding brought under section 2(b) of this chapter, if, upon the motion of a party or in the court's discretion, the court finds on the record that psychological harm to the witness would occur if the witness were to testify at the adjudication stage, the court shall order to be taken a videorecorded deposition of a witness that shall be admitted into evidence at the adjudication stage instead of the live testimony of the witness. The examination and cross-examination of the witness in the videorecorded deposition shall proceed in the same manner as permitted at the adjudication stage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) In a proceeding brought under section 2(a)(1) of this chapter in which the alleged offense, if committed by an adult, would be a felony under section 136b, 145c, 520b to 520e, or 520g of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.136b, 750.145c, 750.520b to 750.520e, and 750.520g, if, upon the motion of a party made before the adjudication stage, the court finds on the record that the special arrangements specified in subsection (15) are necessary to protect the welfare of the witness, the court shall order 1 or both of those special arrangements. In determining whether it is necessary to protect the welfare of the witness, the court shall consider both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The age of the witness.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The nature of the offense or offenses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) If the court determines on the record that it is necessary to protect the welfare of the witness and grants the motion made under subsection (14), the court shall order 1 or both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) In order to protect the witness from directly viewing the respondent, the courtroom shall be arranged so that the respondent is seated as far from the witness stand as is reasonable and not directly in front of the witness stand. The respondent's position shall be located so as to allow the respondent to hear and see all witnesses and be able to communicate with his or her attorney.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A questioner's stand or podium shall be used for all questioning of all witnesses by all parties, and shall be located in front of the witness stand.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) In a proceeding brought under section 2(a)(1) of this chapter in which the alleged offense, if committed by an adult, would be a felony under section 136b, 145c, 520b to 520e, or 520g of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.136b, 750.145c, 750.520b to 750.520e, and 750.520g, if, upon the motion of a party or in the court's discretion, the court finds on the record that the witness is or will be psychologically or emotionally unable to testify at a court proceeding even with the benefit of the protections afforded the witness in subsections (3), (4), and (15), the court shall order that a videorecorded deposition of a witness shall be taken to be admitted at the adjudication stage instead of the witness's live testimony.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) For purposes of the videorecorded deposition under subsection (16), the witness's examination and cross-examination shall proceed in the same manner as if the witness testified at the adjudication stage, and the court shall order that the witness, during his or her testimony, shall not be confronted by the respondent but shall permit the respondent to hear the testimony of the witness and to consult with his or her attorney.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) This section is in addition to other protections or procedures afforded to a witness by law or court rule.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) A person who intentionally releases a videorecorded statement in violation of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $500.00, or both.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In a proceeding under section 2(a) or (d) of this chapter, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the child if 1 or more of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The child's parent refuses or fails to appear and participate in the proceedings.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The child's parent is the complainant or victim.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The court determines that the best interests of the child or the public require appointment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, in a proceeding under section 2(a) or (d) of this chapter, the child may waive his or her right to an attorney. The waiver by a child shall be made in open court, on the record, and shall not be made unless the court finds on the record that the waiver was voluntarily and understandingly made. The child may not waive his or her right to an attorney if the child's parent or guardian ad litem objects or if the appointment is made under subsection (2)(e).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In a proceeding under section 2(b) or (c) of this chapter, the court shall advise the respondent at the respondent's first court appearance of all of the following:</DIV>

The child shall not waive the assistance of the lawyer-guardian ad litem.

An order assessing attorney costs may be enforced through contempt proceedings.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   An attorney or lawyer-guardian ad litem appointed by the court under this section shall serve until discharged by the court. If the child's case was petitioned under section 2(b) of this chapter, the court shall not discharge the lawyer-guardian ad litem for the child as long as the child is subject to the jurisdiction, control, or supervision of the court, or of the Michigan children's institute or other agency, unless the court discharges the lawyer-guardian ad litem for good cause shown on the record. If the child remains subject to the jurisdiction, control, or supervision of the court, or the Michigan children's institute or other agency, the court shall immediately appoint another lawyer-guardian ad litem to represent the child.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   To assist the court in determining a child's best interests, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem for a child involved in a proceeding under this chapter.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) To explain to the child, taking into account the child's ability to understand the proceedings, the lawyer-guardian ad litem's role.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) To file all necessary pleadings and papers and independently call witnesses on the child's behalf.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) To attend all hearings and substitute representation for the child only with court approval.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) To make a determination regarding the child's best interests and advocate for those best interests according to the lawyer-guardian ad litem's understanding of those best interests, regardless of whether the lawyer-guardian ad litem's determination reflects the child's wishes. The child's wishes are relevant to the lawyer-guardian ad litem's determination of the child's best interests, and the lawyer-guardian ad litem shall weigh the child's wishes according to the child's competence and maturity. Consistent with the law governing attorney-client privilege, the lawyer-guardian ad litem shall inform the court of the child's wishes and preferences.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) To monitor the implementation of case plans and court orders and to determine whether services the court ordered for the child or the child's family are being provided in a timely manner and are accomplishing their purpose. The lawyer-guardian ad litem shall inform the court if the services are not being provided in a timely manner, if the family fails to take advantage of the services, or if the services are not accomplishing their intended purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) Consistent with the rules of professional responsibility, to identify common interests among the parties and, to the extent possible, promote a cooperative resolution of the matter through consultation with the child's parent, foster care provider, guardian, and caseworker.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) To request authorization by the court to pursue issues on the child's behalf that do not arise specifically from the court appointment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) To participate in early childhood, child, and adolescent development training.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) To participate in trauma-informed training if provided by the state court administrative office.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If, after discussion between the child and his or her lawyer-guardian ad litem, the lawyer-guardian ad litem determines that the child's interests as identified by the child are inconsistent with the lawyer-guardian ad litem's determination of the child's best interests, the lawyer-guardian ad litem shall communicate the child's position to the court. If the court considers the appointment appropriate considering the child's age and maturity and the nature of the inconsistency between the child's and the lawyer-guardian ad litem's identification of the child's interests, the court may appoint an attorney for the child. An attorney appointed under this subsection serves in addition to the child's lawyer-guardian ad litem.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The court or another party to the case shall not call a lawyer-guardian ad litem as a witness to testify regarding matters related to the case. The lawyer-guardian ad litem's file of the case is not discoverable.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the court finds that a juvenile concerning whom a petition is filed is not within this chapter, the court shall enter an order dismissing the petition. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (10), if the court finds that a juvenile is within this chapter, the court shall order the juvenile returned to his or her parent if the return of the juvenile to his or her parent would not cause a substantial risk of harm to the juvenile or society. The court may also enter any of the following orders of disposition that are appropriate for the welfare of the juvenile and society in view of the facts proven and ascertained:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Warn the juvenile or the juvenile's parents, guardian, or custodian and, except as provided in subsection (7), dismiss the petition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Place the juvenile on probation, or under supervision in the juvenile's own home or in the home of an adult who is related to the juvenile. As used in this subdivision, "related" means a relative as that term is defined in section 13a of this chapter. The court shall order the terms and conditions of probation or supervision, including reasonable rules for the conduct of the parents, guardian, or custodian, if any, as the court determines necessary for the physical, mental, or moral well-being and behavior of the juvenile. The court may order that the juvenile participate in a juvenile drug treatment court under chapter 10A of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.1060 to 600.1088. The court also shall order, as a condition of probation or supervision, that the juvenile shall pay the minimum state cost prescribed by section 18m of this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If a juvenile is within the court's jurisdiction under section 2(a) of this chapter, or under section 2(h) of this chapter for a supplemental petition, place the juvenile in a suitable foster care home subject to the court's supervision. If a juvenile is within the court's jurisdiction under section 2(b) of this chapter, the court shall not place a juvenile in a foster care home subject to the court's supervision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, place the juvenile in or commit the juvenile to a private institution or agency approved or licensed by the department's division of child welfare licensing for the care of juveniles of similar age, sex, and characteristics. If the juvenile is not a ward of the court, the court shall commit the juvenile to the department or, if the county is a county juvenile agency, to that county juvenile agency for placement in or commitment to an institution or agency as the department or county juvenile agency determines is most appropriate, subject to any initial level of placement the court designates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, commit the juvenile to a public institution, county facility, institution operated as an agency of the court or county, or agency authorized by law to receive juveniles of similar age, sex, and characteristics. If the juvenile is not a ward of the court, the court shall commit the juvenile to the department or, if the county is a county juvenile agency, to that county juvenile agency for placement in or commitment to an institution or facility as the department or county juvenile agency determines is most appropriate, subject to any initial level of placement the court designates. In a placement under subdivision (d) or a commitment under this subdivision, except to a state institution or a county juvenile agency, the juvenile's religious affiliation must be protected by placement or commitment to a private child placing or child caring agency or institution, if available. Except for commitment to the department or a county juvenile agency, in an order of commitment under this subdivision to a state institution or agency described in the youth rehabilitation services act, 1974 PA 150, MCL 803.301 to 803.309, or in 1935 PA 220, MCL 400.201 to 400.214, the court shall name the superintendent of the institution where the juvenile is committed as a special guardian to receive benefits due the juvenile from the government of the United States. An order of commitment under this subdivision to the department or a county juvenile agency must name that agency as a special guardian to receive those benefits. The benefits received by the special guardian must be used to the extent necessary to pay for the portions of the cost of care in the institution or facility that the parent or parents are found unable to pay.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Provide the juvenile with medical, dental, surgical, or other health care, in a local hospital if available, or elsewhere, maintaining as much as possible a local physician-patient relationship, and with clothing and other incidental items the court determines are necessary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Order the parents, guardian, custodian, or any other person to refrain from continuing conduct that the court determines has caused or tended to cause the juvenile to come within or to remain under this chapter or that obstructs placement or commitment of the juvenile by an order under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Appoint a guardian under section 5204 of the estates and protected individuals code, 1998 PA 386, MCL 700.5204, in response to a petition filed with the court by a person interested in the juvenile's welfare. If the court appoints a guardian as authorized by this subdivision, it may dismiss the petition under this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Order the juvenile to engage in community service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) If the court finds that a juvenile has violated a municipal ordinance or a state or federal law, order the juvenile to pay a civil fine in the amount of the civil or penal fine provided by the ordinance or law. Money collected from fines levied under this subsection must be distributed as provided in section 29 of this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) If the court finds that the juvenile has violated a court order under section 2(a)(2) to (4) of this chapter, order the juvenile to be placed in a secure facility. A court order under this subdivision must state all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The court order the juvenile violated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The factual basis for determining that there was reasonable cause to believe that the juvenile violated the court order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The court's finding of fact to support a determination that there is no appropriate less restrictive alternative placement available considering the best interests of the juvenile.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The length of time, not to exceed 7 days, that the juvenile may remain in the secure facility and the plan for the juvenile's release from the facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) That the order may not be renewed or extended.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) For a second or subsequent violation of a court order under section 2(a)(2) to (4) of this chapter, issue a second or subsequent order under subdivision (k), but only if the court finds both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The juvenile violated a court order after the date that the court issued the first order under subdivision (k).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The court has procedures in place to ensure that a juvenile held in a secure facility by a court order is not in custody more than 7 days or the length of time authorized by the court, whichever is shorter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) If a juvenile is within the court's jurisdiction under section 2(a)(1) of this chapter, order the juvenile's parent or guardian to personally participate in treatment reasonably available in the parent's or guardian's location.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) If a juvenile is within the court's jurisdiction under section 2(a)(1) of this chapter, place the juvenile in and order the juvenile to complete satisfactorily a program of training in a juvenile boot camp established by the department under the juvenile boot camp act, 1996 PA 263, MCL 400.1301 to 400.1309, as provided in that act. If the county is a county juvenile agency, the court shall commit the juvenile to that county juvenile agency for placement in the program under that act. Upon receiving a report of satisfactory completion of the program from the department, the court shall authorize the juvenile's release from placement in the juvenile boot camp. Following satisfactory completion of the juvenile boot camp program, the juvenile shall complete an additional period of not less than 120 days or more than 180 days of intensive supervised community reintegration in the juvenile's local community. To place or commit a juvenile under this subdivision, the court shall determine all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Placement in a juvenile boot camp will benefit the juvenile.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The juvenile is physically able to participate in the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The juvenile does not appear to have any mental handicap that would prevent participation in the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The juvenile will not be a danger to other juveniles in the boot camp.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) There is an opening in a juvenile boot camp program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) If the court must commit the juvenile to a county juvenile agency, the county juvenile agency is able to place the juvenile in a juvenile boot camp program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(o) If the court entered a judgment of conviction under section 2d of this chapter, enter any disposition under this section or, if the court determines that the best interests of the public would be served, impose any sentence upon the juvenile that could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense for which the juvenile was convicted. If the juvenile is convicted of a violation or conspiracy to commit a violation of section 7403(2)(a)(i) of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7403, the court may impose the alternative sentence permitted under that section if the court determines that the best interests of the public would be served. The court may delay imposing a sentence of imprisonment under this subdivision for a period not longer than the period during which the court has jurisdiction over the juvenile under this chapter by entering an order of disposition delaying imposition of sentence and placing the juvenile on probation upon the terms and conditions it considers appropriate, including any disposition under this section. If the court delays imposing sentence under this section, section 18i of this chapter applies. If the court imposes sentence, it shall enter a judgment of sentence. If the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment, the juvenile shall receive credit against the sentence for time served before sentencing. In determining whether to enter an order of disposition or impose a sentence under this subdivision, the court shall consider all of the following factors, giving greater weight to the seriousness of the offense and the juvenile's prior record:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The seriousness of the offense in terms of community protection, including, but not limited to, the existence of any aggravating factors recognized by the sentencing guidelines, the use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon, and the impact on any victim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The juvenile's culpability in committing the offense, including, but not limited to, the level of the juvenile's participation in planning and carrying out the offense and the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors recognized by the sentencing guidelines.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The juvenile's prior record of delinquency including, but not limited to, any record of detention, any police record, any school record, or any other evidence indicating prior delinquent behavior.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The juvenile's programming history, including, but not limited to, the juvenile's past willingness to participate meaningfully in available programming.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) The adequacy of the punishment or programming available in the juvenile justice system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) The dispositional options available for the juvenile.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(p) In a proceeding under section 2(b) or (c) of this chapter, if a juvenile is removed from the parent's custody at any time, the court shall permit the juvenile's parent to have regular and frequent parenting time with the juvenile. Parenting time between the juvenile and his or her parent shall not be less than 1 time every 7 days unless the court determines either that exigent circumstances require less frequent parenting time or that parenting time, even if supervised, may be harmful to the juvenile's life, physical health, or mental well-being. If the court determines that parenting time, even if supervised, may be harmful to the juvenile's life, physical health, or mental well-being, the court may suspend parenting time until the risk of harm no longer exists. The court may order the juvenile to have a psychological evaluation or counseling, or both, to determine the appropriateness and the conditions of parenting time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An order of disposition placing a juvenile in or committing a juvenile to care outside of the juvenile's own home and under state, county juvenile agency, or court supervision must contain a provision for reimbursement by the juvenile, parent, guardian, or custodian to the court for the cost of care or service. The order shall be reasonable, taking into account both the income and resources of the juvenile, parent, guardian, or custodian. The amount may be based upon the guidelines and model schedule created under subsection (6). If the juvenile is receiving an adoption assistance under sections 115f to 115m or 115t of the social welfare act, 1939 PA 280, MCL 400.115f to 400.115m and 400.115t, the amount must not exceed the amount of the support subsidy. The reimbursement provision applies during the entire period the juvenile remains in care outside of the juvenile's own home and under state, county juvenile agency, or court supervision, unless the juvenile is in the permanent custody of the court. The court shall provide for the collection of all amounts ordered to be reimbursed and the money collected must be accounted for and reported to the county board of commissioners. Collections to cover delinquent accounts or to pay the balance due on reimbursement orders may be made after a juvenile is released or discharged from care outside the juvenile's own home and under state, county juvenile agency, or court supervision. Twenty-five percent of all amounts collected under an order entered under this subsection must be credited to the appropriate fund of the county to offset the administrative cost of collections. The balance of all amounts collected under an order entered under this subsection must be divided in the same ratio in which the county, state, and federal government participate in the cost of care outside the juvenile's own home and under state, county juvenile agency, or court supervision. The court may also collect from the government of the United States benefits paid for the cost of care of a court ward. Money collected for juveniles placed by the court with or committed to the department or a county juvenile agency must be accounted for and reported on an individual juvenile basis. In cases of delinquent accounts, the court may also enter an order to intercept state or federal tax refunds of a juvenile, parent, guardian, or custodian and initiate the necessary offset proceedings to recover the cost of care or service. The court shall send to the person who is the subject of the intercept order advance written notice of the proposed offset. The notice must include notice of the opportunity to contest the offset on the grounds that the intercept is not proper because of a mistake of fact concerning the amount of the delinquency or the identity of the person subject to the order. The court shall provide for the prompt reimbursement of an amount withheld in error or an amount found to exceed the delinquent amount.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An order of disposition placing a juvenile in the juvenile's own home under subsection (1)(b) may contain a provision for reimbursement by the juvenile, parent, guardian, or custodian to the court for the cost of service. If an order is entered under this subsection, an amount due must be determined and treated in the same manner provided for an order entered under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An order directed to a parent or a person other than the juvenile is not effective and binding on the parent or other person unless opportunity for hearing is given by issuance of summons or notice as provided in sections 12 and 13 of this chapter and until a copy of the order, bearing the seal of the court, is served on the parent or other person as provided in section 13 of this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the court appoints an attorney to represent a juvenile, parent, guardian, or custodian, the court may require in an order entered under this section that the juvenile, parent, guardian, or custodian reimburse the court for attorney fees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The office of the state court administrator, under the supervision and direction of the supreme court, shall create guidelines that the court may use in determining the ability of the juvenile, parent, guardian, or custodian to pay for care and any costs of service ordered under subsection (2) or (3). The guidelines must take into account both the income and resources of the juvenile, parent, guardian, or custodian.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the court finds that a juvenile comes under section 30 of this chapter, the court shall order the juvenile or the juvenile's parent to pay restitution as provided in sections 30 and 31 of this chapter and in sections 44 and 45 of the William Van Regenmorter crime victim's rights act, 1985 PA 87, MCL 780.794 and 780.795.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the court imposes restitution as a condition of probation, the court shall require the juvenile to do either of the following as an additional condition of probation:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Engage in community service or, with the victim's consent, perform services for the victim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Seek and maintain paid employment and pay restitution to the victim from the earnings of that employment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the court finds that the juvenile is in intentional default of the payment of restitution, a court may, as provided in section 30 of this chapter, revoke or alter the terms and conditions of probation for nonpayment of restitution. If a juvenile who is ordered to engage in community service intentionally refuses to perform the required community service, the court may revoke or alter the terms and conditions of probation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The court shall not enter an order of disposition for a juvenile offense as defined in section 1a of 1925 PA 289, MCL 28.241a, or a judgment of sentence for a conviction until the court has examined the court file and has determined that the juvenile's biometric data have been collected and forwarded as required by section 3 of 1925 PA 289, MCL 28.243, and the juvenile's fingerprints have been taken and forwarded as required by the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.721 to 28.730. If a juvenile's biometric data have not been collected or a juvenile has not had his or her fingerprints taken, the court shall do either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Order the juvenile to submit himself or herself to the police agency that arrested or obtained the warrant for the juvenile's arrest so the juvenile's biometric data can be collected and forwarded and his or her fingerprints can be taken and forwarded.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Order the juvenile committed to the sheriff's custody for collecting and forwarding the juvenile's biometric data and taking and forwarding the juvenile's fingerprints.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Upon final disposition, conviction, acquittal, or dismissal of an offense within the court's jurisdiction under section 2(a)(1) of this chapter, using forms approved by the state court administrator, the clerk of the court entering the final disposition, conviction, acquittal, or dismissal shall immediately advise the department of state police of that final disposition, conviction, acquittal, or dismissal as required by section 3 of 1925 PA 289, MCL 28.243. The report to the department of state police must include information as to the finding of the judge or jury and a summary of the disposition or sentence imposed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If the court enters an order of disposition based on an act that is a juvenile offense as defined in section 1 of 1989 PA 196, MCL 780.901, the court shall order the juvenile to pay the assessment as provided in that act. If the court enters a judgment of conviction under section 2d of this chapter for an offense that is a felony, misdemeanor, or ordinance violation, the court shall order the juvenile to pay the assessment as provided in 1989 PA 196, MCL 780.901 to 780.911.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) If the court has entered an order of disposition or a judgment of conviction for a listed offense as defined in section 2 of the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.722, the court, the department, or the county juvenile agency shall register the juvenile or accept the juvenile's registration as provided in the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.721 to 28.730.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) If the court enters an order of disposition placing a juvenile in a juvenile boot camp program, or committing a juvenile to a county juvenile agency for placement in a juvenile boot camp program, and the court receives from the department a report that the juvenile has failed to perform satisfactorily in the program, that the juvenile does not meet the program's requirements or is medically unable to participate in the program for more than 25 days, that there is no opening in a juvenile boot camp program, or that the county juvenile agency is unable to place the juvenile in a juvenile boot camp program, the court shall release the juvenile from placement or commitment and enter an alternative order of disposition. A juvenile must not be placed in a juvenile boot camp under an order of disposition more than once, except that a juvenile returned to the court for a medical condition, because there was no opening in a juvenile boot camp program, or because the county juvenile agency was unable to place the juvenile in a juvenile boot camp program may be placed again in the juvenile boot camp program after the medical condition is corrected, an opening becomes available, or the county juvenile agency is able to place the juvenile.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) If the juvenile is within the court's jurisdiction under section 2(a)(1) of this chapter for an offense other than a listed offense as defined in section 2 of the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.722, the court shall determine if the offense is a violation of a law of this state or a local ordinance of a municipality of this state that by its nature constitutes a sexual offense against an individual who is less than 18 years of age. If so, the order of disposition is for a listed offense as defined in section 2 of the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.722, and the court shall include the basis for that determination on the record and include the determination in the order of disposition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) The court shall not impose a sentence of imprisonment in the county jail under subsection (1)(o) unless the present county jail facility for the juvenile's imprisonment meets all requirements under federal law and regulations for housing juveniles. The court shall not impose the sentence until it consults with the sheriff to determine when the sentence will begin to ensure that space will be available for the juvenile.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) In a proceeding under section 2(h) of this chapter, this section only applies to a disposition for a violation of a personal protection order and subsequent proceedings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) If a juvenile is within the court's jurisdiction under section 2(a)(1) of this chapter, the court shall order the juvenile to pay costs as provided in section 18m of this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) A juvenile who has been ordered to pay the minimum state cost as provided in section 18m of this chapter as a condition of probation or supervision and who is not in willful default of the payment of the minimum state cost may petition the court at any time for a remission of the payment of any unpaid portion of the minimum state cost. If the court determines that payment of the amount due will impose a manifest hardship on the juvenile or his or her immediate family, the court may remit all or part of the amount of the minimum state cost due or modify the method of payment.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the court finds that a juvenile concerning whom a petition is filed is not within this chapter, the court shall enter an order dismissing the petition. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (8) and subject to subsection (9), if the court finds that a juvenile is within this chapter, the court shall order the juvenile returned to the juvenile's parent if the return of the juvenile to the juvenile's parent would not cause a substantial risk of harm to the juvenile or society. Subject to subsection (9), the court may also enter any of the following orders of disposition that are appropriate for the welfare of the juvenile and society in view of the facts proven and ascertained:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Warn the juvenile or the juvenile's parents, guardian, or custodian and, except as provided in subsection (5), dismiss the petition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Place the juvenile on probation, or under supervision in the juvenile's own home or in the home of an adult who is related to the juvenile. As used in this subdivision, "related" means a relative as that term is defined in section 13a of this chapter. The court shall order the terms and conditions of probation or supervision, including reasonable rules for the conduct of the parents, guardian, or custodian, if any, as the court determines necessary for the physical, mental, or moral well-being and behavior of the juvenile. The court may order that the juvenile participate in a juvenile drug treatment court under chapter 10A of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.1060 to 600.1088. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If a juvenile is within the court's jurisdiction under section 2(a) of this chapter, or under section 2(h) of this chapter for a supplemental petition, place the juvenile in a suitable foster care home subject to the court's supervision. If a juvenile is within the court's jurisdiction under section 2(b) of this chapter, the court shall not place a juvenile in a foster care home subject to the court's supervision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, place the juvenile in or commit the juvenile to a private institution or agency approved or licensed by the department's division of child welfare licensing for the care of juveniles of similar age, sex, and characteristics. If the juvenile is not a ward of the court, the court shall commit the juvenile to the department or, if the county is a county juvenile agency, to that county juvenile agency for placement in or commitment to an institution or agency as the department or county juvenile agency determines is most appropriate, subject to any initial level of placement the court designates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, commit the juvenile to a public institution, county facility, institution operated as an agency of the court or county, or agency authorized by law to receive juveniles of similar age, sex, and characteristics. If the juvenile is not a ward of the court, the court shall commit the juvenile to the department or, if the county is a county juvenile agency, to that county juvenile agency for placement in or commitment to an institution or facility as the department or county juvenile agency determines is most appropriate, subject to any initial level of placement the court designates. In a placement under subdivision (d) or a commitment under this subdivision, except to a state institution or a county juvenile agency, the juvenile's religious affiliation must be protected by placement or commitment to a private child placing or child caring agency or institution, if available. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Provide the juvenile with medical, dental, surgical, or other health care, in a local hospital if available, or elsewhere, maintaining as much as possible a local physician-patient relationship, and with clothing and other incidental items the court determines are necessary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Order the parents, guardian, custodian, or any other person to refrain from continuing conduct that the court determines has caused or tended to cause the juvenile to come within or to remain under this chapter or that obstructs placement or commitment of the juvenile by an order under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Appoint a guardian under section 5204 of the estates and protected individuals code, 1998 PA 386, MCL 700.5204, in response to a petition filed with the court by a person interested in the juvenile's welfare. If the court appoints a guardian as authorized by this subdivision, it may dismiss the petition under this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Order the juvenile to engage in community service. The court shall not order the juvenile or the juvenile's parent, guardian, or legal custodian to pay for fees or costs associated with community service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) The court shall not order the juvenile or the juvenile's parent, guardian, or legal custodian to pay fines associated with a violation of a municipal ordinance or a state or federal law if another disposition under this section has been ordered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) If the court finds that the juvenile has violated a court order under section 2(a)(2) to (4) of this chapter, order the juvenile to be placed in a secure facility. A court order under this subdivision must state all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The court order the juvenile violated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The factual basis for determining that there was reasonable cause to believe that the juvenile violated the court order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The court's finding of fact to support a determination that there is no appropriate less restrictive alternative placement available considering the best interests of the juvenile.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The length of time, not to exceed 7 days, that the juvenile may remain in the secure facility and the plan for the juvenile's release from the facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) That the order may not be renewed or extended.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) For a second or subsequent violation of a court order under section 2(a)(2) to (4) of this chapter, issue a second or subsequent order under subdivision (k), but only if the court finds both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The juvenile violated a court order after the date that the court issued the first order under subdivision (k).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The court has procedures in place to ensure that a juvenile held in a secure facility by a court order is not in custody more than 7 days or the length of time authorized by the court, whichever is shorter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) If a juvenile is within the court's jurisdiction under section 2(a)(1) of this chapter, order the juvenile's parent or guardian to personally participate in treatment reasonably available in the parent's or guardian's location.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) If a juvenile is within the court's jurisdiction under section 2(a)(1) of this chapter, place the juvenile in and order the juvenile to complete satisfactorily a program of training in a juvenile boot camp established by the department under the juvenile boot camp act, 1996 PA 263, MCL 400.1301 to 400.1309, as provided in that act. If the county is a county juvenile agency, the court shall commit the juvenile to that county juvenile agency for placement in the program under that act. Upon receiving a report of satisfactory completion of the program from the department, the court shall authorize the juvenile's release from placement in the juvenile boot camp. Following satisfactory completion of the juvenile boot camp program, the juvenile shall complete an additional period of not less than 120 days or more than 180 days of intensive supervised community reintegration in the juvenile's local community. To place or commit a juvenile under this subdivision, the court shall determine all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Placement in a juvenile boot camp will benefit the juvenile.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The juvenile is physically able to participate in the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The juvenile does not appear to have any mental handicap that would prevent participation in the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The juvenile will not be a danger to other juveniles in the boot camp.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) There is an opening in a juvenile boot camp program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) If the court must commit the juvenile to a county juvenile agency, the county juvenile agency is able to place the juvenile in a juvenile boot camp program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(o) If the court entered a judgment of conviction under section 2d of this chapter, enter any disposition under this section or, if the court determines that the best interests of the public would be served, impose any sentence upon the juvenile that could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense for which the juvenile was convicted. If the juvenile is convicted of a violation or conspiracy to commit a violation of section 7403(2)(a)(i) of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7403, the court may impose the alternative sentence permitted under that section if the court determines that the best interests of the public would be served. The court may delay imposing a sentence of imprisonment under this subdivision for a period not longer than the period during which the court has jurisdiction over the juvenile under this chapter by entering an order of disposition delaying imposition of sentence and placing the juvenile on probation upon the terms and conditions it considers appropriate, including any disposition under this section. If the court delays imposing sentence under this section, section 18i of this chapter applies. If the court imposes sentence, it shall enter a judgment of sentence. If the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment, the juvenile shall receive credit against the sentence for time served before sentencing. In determining whether to enter an order of disposition or impose a sentence under this subdivision, the court shall consider all of the following factors, giving greater weight to the seriousness of the offense and the juvenile's prior record:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The seriousness of the offense in terms of community protection, including, but not limited to, the existence of any aggravating factors recognized by the sentencing guidelines, the use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon, and the impact on any victim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The juvenile's culpability in committing the offense, including, but not limited to, the level of the juvenile's participation in planning and carrying out the offense and the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors recognized by the sentencing guidelines.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The juvenile's prior record of delinquency including, but not limited to, any record of detention, any police record, any school record, or any other evidence indicating prior delinquent behavior.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The juvenile's programming history, including, but not limited to, the juvenile's past willingness to participate meaningfully in available programming.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) The adequacy of the punishment or programming available in the juvenile justice system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) The dispositional options available for the juvenile.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(p) In a proceeding under section 2(b) or (c) of this chapter, if a juvenile is removed from the parent's custody at any time, the court shall permit the juvenile's parent to have regular and frequent parenting time with the juvenile. Parenting time between the juvenile and the juvenile's parent must not be less than 1 time every 7 days unless the court determines either that exigent circumstances require less frequent parenting time or that parenting time, even if supervised, may be harmful to the juvenile's life, physical health, or mental well-being. If the court determines that parenting time, even if supervised, may be harmful to the juvenile's life, physical health, or mental well-being, the court may suspend parenting time until the risk of harm no longer exists. The court may order the juvenile to have a psychological evaluation or counseling, or both, to determine the appropriateness and the conditions of parenting time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Money collected for juveniles placed by the court with or committed to the department or a county juvenile agency must be accounted for and reported on an individual juvenile basis. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The court shall not order a juvenile or a juvenile's parent, guardian, or legal custodian to pay for the costs of care, services, court-appointed attorney representation, or other costs or assessments related to the juvenile's court proceeding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An order directed to a parent or a person other than the juvenile is not effective and binding on the parent or other person unless opportunity for hearing is given by issuance of summons or notice as provided in sections 12 and 13 of this chapter and until a copy of the order, bearing the seal of the court, is served on the parent or other person as provided in section 13 of this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the court finds that a juvenile comes under section 30 of this chapter, the court shall order the juvenile or the juvenile's parent to pay restitution as provided in sections 30 and 31 of this chapter and in sections 44 and 45 of the William Van Regenmorter crime victim's rights act, 1985 PA 87, MCL 780.794 and 780.795.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the court imposes restitution as a condition of probation, the court shall require the juvenile to do either of the following as an additional condition of probation:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Engage in community service or, with the victim's consent, perform services for the victim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Seek and maintain paid employment and pay restitution to the victim from the earnings of that employment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the court finds that the juvenile is in intentional default of the payment of restitution, a court may, as provided in section 30 of this chapter, revoke or alter the terms and conditions of probation for nonpayment of restitution. If a juvenile who is ordered to engage in community service intentionally refuses to perform the required community service, the court may revoke or alter the terms and conditions of probation. The juvenile must not be placed outside of his or her home solely based on nonpayment of restitution or inability to perform community service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The court shall not enter an order of disposition for a juvenile offense as defined in section 1a of 1925 PA 289, MCL 28.241a, or a judgment of sentence for a conviction until the court has examined the court file and has determined that the juvenile's biometric data have been collected and forwarded as required by section 3 of 1925 PA 289, MCL 28.243, and the juvenile's fingerprints have been taken and forwarded as required by the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.721 to 28.730. If a juvenile's biometric data have not been collected or a juvenile has not had the juvenile's fingerprints taken, the court shall do either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Order the juvenile to submit himself or herself to the police agency that arrested or obtained the warrant for the juvenile's arrest so the juvenile's biometric data can be collected and forwarded and the juvenile's fingerprints can be taken and forwarded.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Order the juvenile committed to the sheriff's custody for collecting and forwarding the juvenile's biometric data and taking and forwarding the juvenile's fingerprints.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A designated individual or agency shall conduct a risk and needs assessment for each juvenile before disposition. The following procedure applies to a risk and needs assessment conducted under this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The results of the risk and needs assessment, and a dispositional recommendation made by the designated individual or agency that performed the risk and needs assessment, must be shared with the court and each party to the proceeding, including the juvenile, counsel for the juvenile, and the prosecuting attorney.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The results of the risk and needs assessment must be used to inform a dispositional recommendation and to determine the most appropriate disposition for the juvenile considering all of the following factors:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The least restrictive setting possible.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Public safety.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Victim interests.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Rehabilitation of the juvenile.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Improved juvenile outcomes, including, but not limited to, educational advancement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The court shall consider the results of the risk and needs assessment conducted under subsection (9) when making a dispositional decision regarding a juvenile found within this chapter, including, but not limited to, any of the following decisions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Whether to place a juvenile under supervision, including the length, level, and conditions of this supervision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Whether to place a juvenile on probation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Whether to place a juvenile in out-of-home care.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) For the duration of each order of disposition for a juvenile found within this chapter, the court shall require a new risk and needs assessment for the juvenile, to be conducted, shared, and used in the same manner as described in subsection (9), if any of the following conditions occur:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Six months have passed since the juvenile's last risk and needs assessment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The juvenile experiences a major life event.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) There is a major change in the juvenile's proceedings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A risk and needs assessment conducted under subsection (9) must meet both of the following requirements:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Be research based and nationally validated for use with juveniles.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Comply with the guidelines created under subsection (13).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The state court administrative office, under the supervision and direction of the supreme court, shall create guidelines on the use of risk and needs assessments under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) A designated individual or agency that conducts risk and needs assessments under subsection (9) must be trained on the appropriate use of the applicable risk and needs assessment selected by the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) A risk and needs assessment conducted as part of a proceeding under this section and any information obtained from a minor in the course of the assessment, including any admission, confession, or incriminating evidence, are not admissible into evidence in any adjudicatory hearing in which the minor is accused and are not subject to subpoena or any other court process for use in any other proceeding or for any other purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) Upon final disposition, conviction, acquittal, or dismissal of an offense within the court's jurisdiction under section 2(a)(1) of this chapter, using forms approved by the state court administrator, the clerk of the court entering the final disposition, conviction, acquittal, or dismissal shall immediately advise the department of state police of that final disposition, conviction, acquittal, or dismissal as required by section 3 of 1925 PA 289, MCL 28.243. The report to the department of state police must include information as to the finding of the judge or jury and a summary of the disposition or sentence imposed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) If the court has entered an order of disposition or a judgment of conviction for a listed offense as that term is defined in section 2 of the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.722, the court, the department, or the county juvenile agency shall register the juvenile or accept the juvenile's registration as provided in the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.721 to 28.730.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) If the court enters an order of disposition placing a juvenile in a juvenile boot camp program, or committing a juvenile to a county juvenile agency for placement in a juvenile boot camp program, and the court receives from the department a report that the juvenile has failed to perform satisfactorily in the program, that the juvenile does not meet the program's requirements or is medically unable to participate in the program for more than 25 days, that there is no opening in a juvenile boot camp program, or that the county juvenile agency is unable to place the juvenile in a juvenile boot camp program, the court shall release the juvenile from placement or commitment and enter an alternative order of disposition. A juvenile must not be placed in a juvenile boot camp under an order of disposition more than once, except that a juvenile returned to the court for a medical condition, because there was no opening in a juvenile boot camp program, or because the county juvenile agency was unable to place the juvenile in a juvenile boot camp program may be placed again in the juvenile boot camp program after the medical condition is corrected, an opening becomes available, or the county juvenile agency is able to place the juvenile.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) If the juvenile is within the court's jurisdiction under section 2(a)(1) of this chapter for an offense other than a listed offense as that term is defined in section 2 of the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.722, the court shall determine if the offense is a violation of a law of this state or a local ordinance of a municipality of this state that by its nature constitutes a sexual offense against an individual who is less than 18 years of age. If so, the order of disposition is for a listed offense as that term is defined in section 2 of the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.722, and the court shall include the basis for that determination on the record and include the determination in the order of disposition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) The court shall not impose a sentence of imprisonment in the county jail under subsection (1)(o) unless the present county jail facility for the juvenile's imprisonment meets all requirements under federal law and regulations for housing juveniles. The court shall not impose the sentence until it consults with the sheriff to determine when the sentence will begin to ensure that space will be available for the juvenile.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) In a proceeding under section 2(h) of this chapter, this section only applies to a disposition for a violation of a personal protection order and subsequent proceedings.</div>

<P>Sec. 18b.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whenever the court under section 18 of this act enters a reimbursement order and the parent or other adult legally responsible for the care of the child fails or refuses to obey and perform the order, and has been found guilty of contempt of court for such failure or refusal, the court making the order may order an assignment to the county or state of the salary, wages or other income of the person responsible for the care of the child, which assignment shall continue until the support is paid in full. The order of assignment shall be effective 1 week after service upon the employer of a true copy of the order by personal service or by registered or certified mail. Thereafter the employer shall withhold from the earnings due the employee the amount specified in the order of assignment for transmittal to the county or state until notified by the court that the support arrearage is paid in full. An employer shall not use the assignment as a basis, in whole or in part, for the discharge of an employee or for any other disciplinary action against an employee. Compliance by an employer with the order of assignment operates as a discharge of the employer's liability to the employee as to that portion of the employee's earnings so affected.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 18d.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a juvenile is committed under section 18(1)(e) of this chapter for an offense that, if committed by an adult, would be a violation or attempted violation of section 72, 83, 84, 86, 88, 89, 91, 110a(2), 186a, 316, 317, 349, 520b, 520c, 520d, 520g, 529, 529a, 530, or 531 of the Michigan penal code, Act No. 328 of the Public Acts of 1931, being sections 750.72, 750.83, 750.84, 750.86, 750.88, 750.89, 750.91, 750.110a, 750.186a, 750.316, 750.317, 750.349, 750.520b, 750.520c, 750.520d, 750.520g, 750.529, 750.529a, 750.530, and 750.531 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, or section 7401(2)(a)(i) or 7403(2)(a)(i) of the public health code, Act No. 368 of the Public Acts of 1978, being sections 333.7401 and 333.7403 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, the court shall conduct a review hearing to determine whether the juvenile has been rehabilitated and whether the juvenile presents a serious risk to public safety. If the court determines that the juvenile has not been rehabilitated or that the juvenile presents a serious risk to public safety, jurisdiction over the juvenile shall be continued. In making this determination, the court shall consider all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The extent and nature of the juvenile's participation in education, counseling, or work programs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The juvenile's willingness to accept responsibility for prior behavior.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Not less than 14 days before a review hearing is to be conducted, the prosecuting attorney, the juvenile, and, if addresses are known, the juvenile's parent or guardian shall be notified. The notice shall state that the court may extend jurisdiction over the juvenile and shall advise the juvenile and the juvenile's parent or guardian of the right to legal counsel. If legal counsel has not been retained or appointed to represent the juvenile, the court shall appoint legal counsel and may assess the cost of providing counsel as costs against the juvenile or those responsible for the juvenile's support, or both, if the persons to be assessed are financially able to comply.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The institution, agency, or facility charged with the care of the juvenile shall prepare commitment reports as provided in section 5 of the juvenile facilities act, Act No. 73 of the Public Acts of 1988, being section 803.225 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, for use by the court at a review hearing held under this section.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A conviction under section 2d of this chapter. This subdivision does not prevent a person convicted under section 2d of this chapter from having that conviction set aside as otherwise provided by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An application under this section shall not be filed until the expiration of 1 year after the termination of jurisdiction.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A statement as to whether the applicant has previously filed an application to set aside this or any other adjudication and, if so, the disposition of the application.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A statement as to whether the applicant has any other criminal charge pending against him or her in any court in the United States or in any other country.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) A consent to the use of the nonpublic record created under subsection (13), to the extent authorized by subsection (13).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Upon application, the adjudicating court or adjudicating courts shall locate any court records or documents necessary to conduct a hearing under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The applicant shall submit a copy of the application and 2 complete sets of fingerprints to the department of state police. The department of state police shall compare those fingerprints with the records of the department, including the nonpublic record created under subsection (13), and shall forward a complete set of fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a comparison with the records available to that agency. The department of state police shall report to the court in which the application is filed the information contained in the department's records with respect to any pending charges against the applicant, any record of adjudication or conviction of the applicant, and the setting aside of any adjudication or conviction of the applicant and shall report to the court any similar information obtained from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The court shall not act upon the application until the department of state police reports the information required by this subsection to the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A copy of the application must be served upon the attorney general and, if applicable, upon the office of the prosecuting attorney who prosecuted the offense. The attorney general and the prosecuting attorney shall have an opportunity to contest the application. If the attorney general or prosecuting attorney wishes to contest an application, the attorney general or prosecuting attorney must do so not later than 35 days after service. If the adjudication was for an offense that if committed by an adult would be an assaultive crime or serious misdemeanor, and if the name of the victim is known to the prosecuting attorney, the prosecuting attorney shall give the victim of that offense written notice of the application and forward a copy of the application to the victim under section 46a of the William Van Regenmorter crime victim's rights act, 1985 PA 87, MCL 780.796a. The notice must be sent by first-class mail to the victim's last known address. The victim has the right to appear at any proceeding under this section concerning that adjudication and to make a written or oral statement. As used in this subsection:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Victim" means that term as defined in section 31 of the William Van Regenmorter crime victim's rights act, 1985 PA 87, MCL 780.781.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Upon the hearing of the application, the court may require the filing of affidavits and the taking of proofs as it considers proper.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Except as provided in this subsection and subsection (10), if the court determines that the circumstances and behavior of the applicant from the date of the applicant's adjudication to the filing of the application warrant setting aside the 1 adjudication for a juvenile offense that would be a felony if committed by an adult and not more than 2 adjudications for a juvenile offense that would be a misdemeanor if committed by an adult or if there is no adjudication for a felony if committed by an adult, not more than 3 adjudications for an offense that would be a misdemeanor if committed by an adult and that setting aside the adjudication or adjudications is consistent with the public welfare, the court may enter an order setting aside the adjudication. If the applicant submits to the court a certificate of completion from the Michigan youth challeNGe academy showing that the applicant has completed that program, the court shall determine that the applicant's circumstances and behavior warrant setting aside the adjudication. If the court also determines that setting aside the adjudication or adjudications is consistent with the public welfare, the court may enter an order setting aside the adjudication as provided in this subsection. Except as provided in subsection (10), the setting aside of an adjudication under this section is a privilege and conditional, and is not a right.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If the person files an application with the court and he or she otherwise meets all the requirements, notwithstanding subsection (9), the court shall set aside the adjudication of a person as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The person was adjudicated for an offense that if committed by an adult would be a violation or an attempted violation of section 413 of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.413. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The person was adjudicated for an offense that if committed by an adult would be a violation or an attempted violation of section 448, 449, or 450 of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.448, 750.449, and 750.450, or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to section 448, 449, or 450 of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.448, 750.449, and 750.450, and he or she committed the offense as a direct result of his or her being a victim of a human trafficking violation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Upon the entry of an order under this section, the applicant is considered not to have been previously adjudicated, except as provided in subsection (13) and as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The applicant is not entitled to the remission of any fine, costs, or other money paid as a consequence of an adjudication that is set aside.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) This section does not affect the right of the applicant to rely upon the adjudication to bar subsequent proceedings for the same offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) This section does not affect the right of a victim of an offense to prosecute or defend a civil action for damages.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) This section does not create a right to commence an action for damages for detention under the disposition that the applicant served before the adjudication is set aside under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Upon the entry of an order under this section, the court shall send a copy of the order to the arresting agency and the department of state police.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The department of state police shall retain a nonpublic record of the order setting aside an adjudication for a juvenile offense that would be a felony if committed by an adult and not more than 2 juvenile offenses that would be misdemeanors if committed by an adult or if there is no adjudication for a felony if committed by an adult, not more than 3 adjudications for an offense that would be a misdemeanor if committed by an adult and of the record of the arrest, fingerprints, adjudication, and disposition of the applicant in the case to which the order applies. Except as provided in subsection (14), this nonpublic record must be made available only to a court of competent jurisdiction, an agency of the judicial branch of state government, a law enforcement agency, a prosecuting attorney, the attorney general, or the governor upon request and only for the following purposes:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Consideration in a licensing function conducted by an agency of the judicial branch of state government.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Consideration by a law enforcement agency if a person whose adjudication has been set aside applies for employment with the law enforcement agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) To show that a person who has filed an application to set aside an adjudication has previously had an adjudication set aside under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The court's consideration in determining the sentence to be imposed upon conviction for a subsequent offense that is punishable as a felony or by imprisonment for more than 1 year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Consideration by the governor, if a person whose adjudication has been set aside applies for a pardon for another offense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) A copy of the nonpublic record created under subsection (13) must be provided to the person whose adjudication is set aside under this section upon payment of a fee determined and charged by the department of state police in the same manner as the fee prescribed in section 4 of the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.234.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) The nonpublic record maintained under subsection (13) is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) Except as provided in subsection (13), a person, other than the applicant, who knows or should have known that an adjudication was set aside under this section, who divulges, uses, or publishes information concerning an adjudication set aside under this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) An order setting aside an adjudication for a traffic offense under this section must not require that the conviction be removed or expunged from the applicant's driving record maintained by the secretary of state as required under the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.1 to 257.923.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A delay in sentencing does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to sentence the juvenile under section 18(1)(o) of this chapter any time during the delay.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the court has entered an order of disposition under section 18(1)(o) of this chapter delaying imposition of sentence, the court shall conduct an annual review of the probation, including but not limited to the services being provided to the juvenile, the juvenile's placement, and the juvenile's progress in that placement. In conducting this review, the court shall examine any annual report prepared under section 3 of the juvenile facilities act, 1988 PA 73, MCL 803.223, and any report prepared upon the court's order by the officer or agency supervising probation. The court may order changes in the juvenile's probation based on the review including but not limited to imposition of sentence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the court entered an order of disposition under section 18(1)(o) of this chapter delaying imposition of sentence, the court shall conduct a review hearing to determine whether the juvenile has been rehabilitated and whether the juvenile presents a serious risk to public safety. If the court determines that the juvenile has not been rehabilitated or that the juvenile presents a serious risk to public safety, jurisdiction over the juvenile shall be continued or the court may impose sentence. In making this determination, the court shall consider the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The extent and nature of the juvenile's participation in education, counseling, or work programs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The juvenile's willingness to accept responsibility for prior behavior.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The juvenile's behavior in his or her current placement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The prior record and character of the juvenile and his or her physical and mental maturity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The juvenile's potential for violent conduct as demonstrated by prior behavior.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Other information the prosecuting attorney or juvenile may submit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A review hearing shall be scheduled and held unless adjourned for good cause as near as possible to, but before, the juvenile's nineteenth birthday. If an institution or agency to which the juvenile was committed believes that the juvenile has been rehabilitated and that the juvenile does not present a serious risk to public safety, the institution or agency may petition the court to conduct a review hearing any time before the juvenile becomes 19 years of age or, if the court has continued jurisdiction, any time before the juvenile becomes 21 years of age.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Not less than 14 days before a review hearing is to be conducted, the prosecuting attorney, juvenile, and, if addresses are known, the juvenile's parent or guardian shall be notified. The notice shall state that the court may extend jurisdiction over the juvenile or impose sentence and shall advise the juvenile and the juvenile's parent or guardian of the right to legal counsel. If legal counsel has not been retained or appointed to represent the juvenile, the court shall appoint legal counsel and may assess the cost of providing counsel as costs against the juvenile or those responsible for the juvenile's support, or both, if the persons to be assessed are financially able to comply.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A commitment report prepared as provided in section 5 of the juvenile facilities act, 1988 PA 73, MCL 803.225, and any report prepared upon the court's order by the officer or agency supervising probation may be used by the court at a review hearing held under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The court shall conduct a final review of the juvenile's probation not less than 3 months before the end of the probation period. If the court determines at this review that the best interests of the public would be served by imposing any other sentence provided by law for an adult offender, the court may impose the sentence. In making its determination, the court shall consider the criteria specified in subsection (3) and all of the following criteria:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The effect of treatment on the juvenile's rehabilitation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Whether the juvenile is likely to be dangerous to the public if released.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The best interests of the public welfare and the protection of public security.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Not less than 14 days before a final review hearing under subsection (7) is to be conducted, the prosecuting attorney, juvenile, and, if addresses are known, the juvenile's parent or guardian shall be notified. The notice shall state that the court may impose a sentence upon the juvenile and shall advise the juvenile and the juvenile's parent or guardian of the right to legal counsel. If legal counsel has not been retained or appointed to represent the juvenile, the court shall appoint legal counsel and may assess the cost of providing counsel as costs against the juvenile or those responsible for the juvenile's support, or both, if the persons to be assessed are financially able to comply.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If a juvenile placed on probation under an order of disposition delaying imposition of sentence is found by the court to have violated probation by being convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year, or adjudicated as responsible for an offense that if committed by an adult would be a felony or a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year, the court shall revoke probation and sentence the juvenile to imprisonment for a term that does not exceed the penalty that could have been imposed for the offense for which the juvenile was originally convicted and placed on probation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If a juvenile placed on probation under an order of disposition delaying imposition of sentence is found by the court to have violated probation other than as provided in subsection (9), the court may impose sentence or may order any of the following for the juvenile:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A change of placement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Community service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Substance use disorder counseling.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Mental health counseling.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Participation in a vocational-technical education program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Incarceration in a county jail for not more than 30 days as provided in this chapter. A juvenile shall be placed in a room or ward out of sight and sound from adult prisoners.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Other participation or performance as the court considers necessary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If a sentence of imprisonment is imposed under this section, the juvenile shall receive credit for the period of time served on probation.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If in a proceeding under section 2(b) of this chapter a child is placed in foster care, the court shall determine at the dispositional hearing and each review hearing whether the cause should be reviewed before the next review hearing required by subsection (2), (3), or (4).

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to subsection (2), if a child remains in foster care and parental rights to the child have not been terminated, the court shall conduct a permanency planning hearing within 12 months after the child was removed from his or her home. Subsequent permanency planning hearings must be held no later than every 12 months after each preceding permanency planning hearing during the continuation of foster care. If proper notice for a permanency planning hearing is provided, a permanency planning hearing may be combined with a review hearing held under section 19(2) to (4) of this chapter, but no later than 12 months from the removal of the child from his or her home, from the preceding permanency planning hearing, or from the number of days required under subsection (2). A permanency planning hearing shall not be canceled or delayed beyond the number of months required by this subsection or days as required under subsection (2), regardless of whether there is a petition to terminate parental rights pending. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The court shall conduct a permanency planning hearing within 30 days after there is a judicial determination that reasonable efforts to reunite the child and family are not required. Reasonable efforts to reunify the child and family must be made in all cases except if any of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) There is a judicial determination that the parent has subjected the child to aggravated circumstances as provided in section 18(1) and (2) of the child protection law, 1975 PA 238, MCL 722.638.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The parent has been convicted of 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Murder of another child of the parent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Voluntary manslaughter of another child of the parent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Aiding or abetting in the murder of another child of the parent or voluntary manslaughter of another child of the parent, the attempted murder of the child or another child of the parent, or the conspiracy or solicitation to commit the murder of the child or another child of the parent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) A felony assault that results in serious bodily injury to the child or another child of the parent. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The parent has had rights to the child's siblings involuntarily terminated and the parent has failed to rectify the conditions that led to that termination of parental rights.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The parent is required by court order to register under the sex offenders registration act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A permanency planning hearing must be conducted to review the child's status and the progress being made toward the child's return home or to show why the child should not be placed in the permanent custody of the court. The court shall obtain the child's views regarding the permanency plan in a manner that is appropriate to the child's age. In the case of a child who will not be returned home, the court shall consider in-state and out-of-state placement options. In the case of a child placed out-of-state, the court shall determine whether the out-of-state placement continues to be appropriate and in the child's best interests. The court shall ensure that the agency is providing appropriate services to assist a child who will transition from foster care to independent living.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) At or before each permanency planning hearing, the court shall determine whether the agency has made reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan. At the hearing, the court shall determine whether and, if applicable, when the following must occur:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The child may be returned to the parent, guardian, or legal custodian.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A petition to terminate parental rights should be filed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The child may be placed in a legal guardianship.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The child may be permanently placed with a fit and willing relative.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The child may be placed in another planned permanent living arrangement, but only in those cases where the agency has documented to the court a compelling reason for determining that it would not be in the best interest of the child to follow 1 of the options listed in subdivisions (a) to (d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The court shall determine whether or not the agency, foster home, or institutional placement has followed the reasonable and prudent parenting standard that the child has had regular opportunities to engage in age or developmentally appropriate activities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Not less than 14 days before a permanency planning hearing, written notice of the hearing and a statement of the purposes of the hearing, including a notice that the hearing may result in further proceedings to terminate parental rights, must be served on all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The agency. The agency shall advise the child of the hearing if the child is 11 years of age or older.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The child's foster parent or custodian. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the parental rights to the child have not been terminated, the child's parents.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If the child has a guardian, the guardian for the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the child has a guardian ad litem, the guardian ad litem for the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) If tribal affiliation has been determined, the elected leader of the Indian tribe.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The attorney for the child, the attorneys for each party, and the prosecuting attorney if the prosecuting attorney has appeared in the case.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) If the child is 11 years of age or older, the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Other persons as the court may direct.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If parental rights to the child have not been terminated and the court determines at a permanency planning hearing that the return of the child to his or her parent would not cause a substantial risk of harm to the child's life, physical health, or mental well-being, the court shall order the child returned to his or her parent. In determining whether returning the child would cause a substantial risk of harm to the child, the court shall view the failure of the parent to substantially comply with the terms and conditions of the case service plan prepared under section 18f of this chapter as evidence that returning the child to his or her parent would cause a substantial risk of harm to the child's life, physical health, or mental well-being. In addition to considering conduct of the parent as evidence of substantial risk of harm, the court shall consider any condition or circumstance of the child that may be evidence that returning the child to the parent would cause a substantial risk of harm to the child's life, physical health, or mental well-being.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the court determines at a permanency planning hearing that a child should not be returned to his or her parent, the court may order the agency to initiate proceedings to terminate parental rights. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if the child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the state for 15 of the most recent 22 months, the court shall order the agency to initiate proceedings to terminate parental rights. The court is not required to order the agency to initiate proceedings to terminate parental rights if 1 or more of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The child is being cared for by relatives.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The case service plan documents a compelling reason for determining that filing a petition to terminate parental rights would not be in the best interest of the child. Compelling reasons for not filing a petition to terminate parental rights include, but are not limited to, all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Adoption is not the appropriate permanency goal for the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) No grounds to file a petition to terminate parental rights exist.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The child is an unaccompanied refugee minor as defined in 45 CFR 400.111.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) There are international legal obligations or compelling foreign policy reasons that preclude terminating parental rights.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The state has not provided the child's family, consistent with the time period in the case service plan, with the services the state considers necessary for the child's safe return to his or her home, if reasonable efforts are required.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the agency demonstrates under subsection (8) that initiating termination of parental rights to the child is clearly not in the child's best interests, or the court does not order the agency to initiate termination of parental rights to the child under subsection (8), the court shall order 1 or more of the following alternative placement plans:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the court determines that other permanent placement is not possible, the child's placement in foster care must continue for a limited period to be stated by the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the court determines that it is in the child's best interests based on compelling reasons, the child's placement in foster care may continue on a long-term basis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Subject to subsection (11), if the court determines that it is in the child's best interests, appoint a guardian for the child, which guardianship may continue until the child is emancipated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A guardian appointed under subsection (9)(c) has all of the powers and duties set forth under section 5215 of the estates and protected individuals code, 1998 PA 386, MCL 700.5215.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If a child is placed in a guardian's or a proposed guardian's home under subsection (9)(c), the court shall order the department to perform an investigation and file a written report of the investigation for a review under subsection (12) and the court shall order the department to do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Perform a criminal record check within 7 days.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Perform a central registry clearance within 7 days.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Perform a home study and file a copy of the home study with the court within 30 days unless a home study has been performed within the immediately preceding 365 days, under section 13a(11) of this chapter. If a home study has been performed within the immediately preceding 365 days, a copy of that home study must be submitted to the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The court's jurisdiction over a juvenile under section 2(b) of this chapter must be terminated after the court appoints a guardian under this section and conducts a review hearing under section 19 of this chapter, unless the juvenile is released sooner by the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The court's jurisdiction over a guardianship created under this section must continue until released by court order. The court shall review a guardianship created under this section annually and may conduct additional reviews as the court considers necessary. The court may order the department or a court employee to conduct an investigation and file a written report of the investigation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) In making the determinations under this section, the court shall consider any written or oral information concerning the child from the child's parent, guardian, custodian, foster parent, child caring institution, relative with whom the child is placed, or guardian ad litem in addition to any other evidence, including the appropriateness of parenting time, offered at the hearing. If a qualified residential treatment program placement as provided in section 13a of 1973 PA 116, MCL 722.123a, is presented, the court shall approve or disapprove that qualified residential treatment program placement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) The court may, on its own motion or upon petition from the department or the child's lawyer guardian ad litem, hold a hearing to determine whether a guardianship appointed under this section must be revoked.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) A guardian may petition the court for permission to terminate the guardianship. A petition may include a request for appointment of a successor guardian.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) After notice and hearing on a petition to revoke or permission to terminate the guardianship, if the court finds by a preponderance of evidence that continuing the guardianship is not in the child's best interests, the court shall revoke or terminate the guardianship and appoint a successor guardian or restore temporary legal custody to the department.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The court's jurisdiction over a juvenile under section 2(b) of this chapter and the jurisdiction of the Michigan children's institute under section 3 of 1935 PA 220, MCL 400.203, shall be terminated after the court appoints a guardian under this section and conducts a review hearing under section 19 of this chapter, unless the juvenile is released sooner by the court. </div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 30.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   For purposes of this section and section 31:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Juvenile offense" means a violation by a juvenile of a penal law of this state or a violation by a juvenile of an ordinance of a local unit of government of this state punishable by imprisonment or by a fine that is not a civil fine.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Victim" means an individual who suffers direct or threatened physical, financial, or emotional harm as a result of the commission of a juvenile offense. For purposes of subsections (2), (3), (6), (8), (9), and (13), victim includes a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, association, governmental entity, or other legal entity that suffers direct physical or financial harm as a result of the commission of a juvenile offense.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as provided in subsection (8), at the dispositional hearing for a juvenile offense, the court shall order, in addition to or in lieu of any other disposition authorized by law, that the juvenile make full restitution to any victim of the juvenile's course of conduct that gives rise to the disposition or to the victim's estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a juvenile offense results in damage to or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the juvenile offense, or results in the seizure or impoundment of property of a victim of the juvenile offense, the order of restitution may require that the juvenile do 1 or more of the following, as applicable:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Return the property to the owner of the property or to a person designated by the owner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If return of the property under subdivision (a) is impossible, impractical, or inadequate, pay an amount equal to the greater of subparagraph (i) or (ii), less the value, determined as of the date the property is returned, of that property or any part of the property that is returned:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   The value of the property on the date of disposition.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Pay the costs of the seizure or impoundment, or both.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a juvenile offense results in physical or psychological injury to a victim, the order of restitution may require that the juvenile do 1 or more of the following, as applicable:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Pay an amount equal to the cost of actual medical and related professional services and devices relating to physical and psychological care.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Pay an amount equal to the cost of actual physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Reimburse the victim or the victim's estate for after-tax income loss suffered by the victim as a result of the juvenile offense.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Pay an amount equal to the cost of psychological and medical treatment for members of the victim's family that has been incurred as a result of the juvenile offense.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Pay an amount equal to the costs of actual homemaking and child care expenses incurred as a result of the juvenile offense.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a juvenile offense resulting in bodily injury also results in the death of a victim, the order of restitution may require that the juvenile pay an amount equal to the cost of actual funeral and related services.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If the victim or victim's estate consents, the order of restitution may require that the juvenile make restitution in services in lieu of money. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If the victim is deceased, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the victim's estate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The court shall order restitution to the crime victims compensation board or to any individuals, partnerships, corporations, associations, governmental entities, or any other legal entities that have compensated the victim or victim's estate for a loss incurred by the victim to the extent of the compensation paid for that loss. The court shall also order restitution, for the costs of services provided, to persons or entities that have provided services to the victim as a result of the juvenile offense. Services that are subject to restitution under this subsection include, but are not limited to, shelter, food, clothing, and transportation. However, an order of restitution shall require that all restitution to a victim or victim's estate under the order be made before any restitution to any other person or entity under that order is made. The court shall not order restitution to be paid to a victim or victim's estate if the victim or victim's estate has received or is to receive compensation for that loss, and the court shall state on the record with specificity the reasons for its actions. If an entity entitled to restitution under this subsection for compensating the victim or the victim's estate cannot or refuses to be reimbursed for that compensation, the restitution paid for that entity shall be deposited by the state treasurer in the crime victim's rights fund created under section 4 of Act No. 196 of the Public Acts of 1989, being section 780.904 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, or its successor fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   Any amount paid to a victim or victim's estate under an order of restitution shall be set off against any amount later recovered as compensatory damages by the victim or the victim's estate in any federal or state civil proceeding and shall reduce the amount payable to a victim or a victim's estate by an award from the crime victims compensation board made after an order of restitution under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   If not otherwise provided by the court under this subsection, restitution shall be made immediately. However, the court may require that the juvenile make restitution under this section within a specified period or in specified installments. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   If the juvenile is placed on probation, any restitution ordered under this section shall be a condition of that probation. The court may revoke probation if the juvenile fails to comply with the order and if the juvenile has not made a good faith effort to comply with the order. In determining whether to revoke probation, the court shall consider the juvenile's employment status, earning ability, and financial resources, the willfulness of the juvenile's failure to pay, and any other special circumstances that may have a bearing on the juvenile's ability to pay.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   A juvenile who is required to pay restitution and who is not in willful default of the payment of the restitution may at any time petition the court to modify the method of payment. If the court determines that payment under the order will impose a manifest hardship on the juvenile or his or her immediate family, the court may modify the method of payment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   An order of restitution entered under this section remains effective until it is satisfied in full. An order of restitution is a judgment and lien against all property of the individual ordered to pay restitution for the amount specified in the order of restitution. The lien may be recorded as provided by law. An order of restitution may be enforced by the prosecuting attorney, a victim, a victim's estate, or any other person or entity named in the order to receive the restitution in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action or a lien.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(14)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a juvenile shall not be detained for a violation of probation, or otherwise, for failure to pay restitution as ordered under this section unless the court determines that the juvenile has the resources to pay the ordered restitution and has not made a good faith effort to do so.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(15)   If the court determines that the juvenile is or will be unable to pay all of the restitution ordered, after notice to the juvenile's parent and an opportunity for the parent to be heard, the court may order the parent or parents having supervisory responsibility for the juvenile at the time of the acts upon which an order of restitution is based to pay any portion of the restitution ordered that is outstanding. An order under this subsection does not relieve the juvenile of his or her obligation to pay restitution, but the amount owed by the juvenile shall be offset by any amount paid by his or her parent. As used in this subsection, "parent" does not include a foster parent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(16)   If the court orders a parent to pay restitution under subsection (15), the court shall take into account the financial resources of the parent and the burden that the payment of restitution will impose, with due regard to any other moral or legal financial obligations that the parent may have. If a parent is required to pay restitution under subsection (15), the court shall provide for payment to be made in specified installments and within a specified period of time.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(17)   A parent who has been ordered to pay restitution under subsection (15) may petition the court for a modification of the amount of restitution owed by the parent or for a cancellation of any unpaid portion of the parent's obligation. The court shall cancel all or part of the parent's obligation due if the court determines that payment of the amount due will impose a manifest hardship on the parent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(18)   In each case in which payment of restitution is ordered as a condition of probation, the juvenile caseworker or probation officer assigned to the case shall review the case not less than twice yearly to ensure that restitution is being paid as ordered. The final review shall be conducted not less than 60 days before the expiration of the probationary period. If the juvenile caseworker or probation officer determines the restitution is not being paid as ordered, the juvenile caseworker or probation officer shall file a written report of the violation with the court on a form prescribed by the state court administrative office. The report shall include a statement of the amount of the arrearage and any reasons for the arrearage that are known by the juvenile caseworker or probation officer. The juvenile caseworker or probation officer shall immediately provide a copy of the report to the prosecuting attorney. If a motion is filed or other proceedings are initiated to enforce payment of restitution and the court determines that restitution is not being paid or has not been paid as ordered by the court, the court shall promptly take action necessary to compel compliance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(19)   If the court determines that an individual who is ordered to pay restitution under this section is remanded to the jurisdiction of the department of corrections, the court shall provide a copy of the order of restitution to the department of corrections when the court determines that the individual is remanded to the department's jurisdiction.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An Indian tribe has exclusive jurisdiction over any child custody proceeding involving an Indian child who resides or is domiciled within the reservation of that tribe.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The state court may exercise limited emergency jurisdiction if an Indian child who resides or is domiciled within the reservation is temporarily off the reservation and the state has removed the Indian child in an emergency situation to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the Indian child. The court must comply with the emergency removal hearing requirements outlined in Michigan court rules and sections 13a, 14, and 14a of chapter XIIA. The emergency jurisdiction terminates when the removal or placement is no longer necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the Indian child. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A court may determine that good cause not to transfer a case to tribal court exists only if the person opposing the transfer shows by clear and convincing evidence that either of the following applies: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The Indian tribe does not have a tribal court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The requirement of the parties or witnesses to present evidence in tribal court would cause undue hardship to those parties or witnesses that the Indian tribe is unable to mitigate. </div>
