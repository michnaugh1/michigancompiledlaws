<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The following plans shall be adopted by the local legislative body of the municipality in which the development area is located:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A master plan of the municipality or a master plan which is sufficiently advanced to designate areas in need of rehabilitation or in need of measures to prevent blight. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A plan of the general features of development of the district within which the development area lies and of other districts adjacent to the development area, of such extent, content, and particularity as is necessary to the coordination of the development area plan with the future development of the territory surrounding the development area, or, if no future development is planned, then in coordination with the present development.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   District areas shall be designated for all development areas that have been approved by a local legislative body and subject to the terms of this act as of January 1, 1968, and all subsequent development areas that are so approved. A district area shall not be designated unless the local legislative body first holds a public hearing on the designation. The legislative body shall give notice of the public hearing not less than 20 nor more than 30 days before the date for the public hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Citizens' district councils are governed by the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, for each district area, a citizens' district council of not less than 12 nor more than 25 members shall be selected in a manner that ensures that the citizens' district council is to the maximum extent possible representative of the residents of the area and of other persons with a demonstrable and substantial interest in the area. The majority of the citizens' district council shall be composed of citizens living in the development area.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The term of office on the councils shall be 3 years. If terms of council members are not staggered, then, upon the expiration of the terms of the members of the citizens' district council, 1/3 shall be elected or appointed for 3 years, 1/3 for 2 years and 1/3 for 1 year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Members of the council may be selected by direct election by the residents of the area and other persons with a demonstrable and substantial interest in the area, or may be appointed by the chief executive officer of the municipality after consultation with local community groups and residents of the area, or by a combination of appointment and election. The method of selection of the citizens' district council, and any appointments to the council by the chief executive officer, shall be determined with the approval of the local legislative body after a public hearing has been held, with public notice of such hearing distributed throughout the district area at least 20 days before the date of the hearing. Citizens' district councils shall be established within 45 days of any initial designation of a development area by any local planning agency or local legislative body.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   In a city of over 1,000,000, the local legislative body shall adopt an ordinance governing the composition and method of selecting the members of the citizens' district councils, with the limitation that such an ordinance shall provide for a majority of the citizens' district council to be composed of citizens living in a development area or areas.</DIV>

Each citizens' district council may call upon any city department for information.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   In a municipality with 2 or more district areas, each citizens' district council shall elect 4 of its members who shall compose the entire membership of the coordinating council on community redevelopment. The committee shall advise local units of government on proposed policy on urban renewal, make recommendations for new projects, and promote better relations between local units of government and residents of urban renewal areas. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this act, the formation of a coordinating council on community redevelopment shall not be a requisite for or condition of the exercise of the powers granted by this act for the acquisition, sale, or lease of real property, or the carrying out of a development plan in a development area.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   The local legislative body shall adopt a development plan after consultation with a citizens' district council, if required, and a public hearing on the development plan as provided in subsection (11), for the development area in which the land proposed to be acquired is located or for the effectuation or protection of which development the proposed land acquisition is deemed necessary. A development plan shall comply with the following:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi)    Street tree planting, green belts, or buffer strips. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii)    Property renovation in accordance with this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii)    Parking facilities.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ix)    Commercial area promotion.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(x)    Economic restructuring of commercial areas.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(xi)    Recruiting of new businesses.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(xii)    Other appropriate public improvements and activities which address rehabilitation or blight prevention in accordance with this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The plan shall include estimates of the number of persons residing in the development area and the number of families and individuals to be displaced; a survey of their income and racial composition; a statistical description of the housing supply in the community, including the number of private and public units in existence or under construction, the annual rate of turnover of the various types of housing, and the range of rents and sale prices; an estimate of the total demand for housing in the community; and the estimated capacity of private and public housing available to displaced families and individuals.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   A local administrative agency shall be designated to provide information concerning private and public housing available to displaced families and individuals and to advise and assist in their relocation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   Before the determination of a blighted area and a determination that there is a feasible method for relocation of families and individuals who will be displaced from the area, and before adoption of a development plan, the local legislative body shall hold a public hearing, which hearing shall comply with the following: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation not less than 30 days before the date set for the hearing. Notice of the hearing shall be distributed in the blighted area at least 25 days before the hearing. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed at least 25 days before the hearing to the last known owner of each parcel of land in the blighted area at the last known address of that owner as shown by the records of the assessor. The notice shall contain a description of the development area. For purposes of this notice it shall be sufficient to describe the boundaries of the development area by its location in relation to highways, streets, streams, or otherwise. The notice shall further contain a statement that maps, plats, and a particular description of the development plan, including the method of relocating families and individuals who will be displaced from the area, are available for public inspection at a place to be designated in the notice, and that all aspects of the development plan will be open for discussion at the public hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   At the time set for hearing the local legislative body shall provide an opportunity for all persons interested to be heard and shall receive and consider communications in writing with reference to the development plan. The hearing shall provide the fullest opportunity for expression of opinion, for argument on the merits of the development plan, and for introduction of documentary evidence pertinent to the development plan.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The local legislative body shall make and preserve a record of the public hearing, including specific findings of fact with respect to its determination of the blighted area and its determination that there is a feasible method for relocation of families and individuals who will be displaced from the area, all data presented at the public hearing and all other data which the legislative body considered in making its determinations. If no individuals reside in the development area, the legislative body is not required to determine a feasible method for relocating residents.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   Within 10 days after the completion of the public hearing as provided in subsection (11), the citizens' district council for the district within which the proposed development area is located shall notify the local legislative body in writing of its approval or disapproval of the development plan. If the citizens' district council approves the plan or fails to notify the local legislative body of its approval or disapproval of the plan, the local legislative body is free to act on the plan. If the citizens' district council disapproves the plan and so notifies in writing the local legislative body, the local legislative body shall not adopt the plan for at least 30 days after receipt of the notice and during that period shall consult with the citizens' district council concerning its objections.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 5a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Where, pursuant to the development of a project, disposition of acquired lands in accordance with the development plan is hampered by reason of the size or character of the lots or tracts of land within the development area, and where diversification of ownership within the development area prohibits redesign by means of a proprietor's plat, the municipality, by action of its governing body, may authorize a plat or replat of the area or any part thereof to be made by a registered civil engineer or a registered land surveyor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The plat shall be prepared, approved and recorded as provided in Act No. 172 of the Public Acts of 1929, as amended, being sections 560.1 to 560.80 of the Compiled Laws of 1948, except that the certificate of the county and city treasurer relating to tax titles and tax liens shall not be required, and in lieu of the signature of the proprietor of the land the dedication shall be signed by the director of urban renewal or by the administrative officer of the municipality and shall refer to this act as the authority for certification. There shall be set forth in the title of the plat the words "urban renewal plat" or "urban renewal replat". Unplatted and previously platted lands may be included in the same plat, and such plat shall supersede all previously recorded plats in the area covered by the urban renewal plat or urban renewal replat.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   All lands within the development area, whether publicly or privately owned, may be included in the urban renewal plat or urban renewal replat, and all land so platted shall be divided into lots and be numbered in accordance with the development plan, except that no lot shall include property in both public and private ownership, nor in 2 or more individual private ownerships, unless such division is of a lot in a recorded subdivision which was so divided prior to the making of the urban renewal plat or urban renewal replat.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The plat or replat shall state in the dedication that necessary rights to all highways, streets, alleys and public places, including parks, green belts and buffer strips, have been acquired by the municipality by purchase, dedication, condemnation or adverse possession for public use, prior to the making of the urban renewal plat or urban renewal replat.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   All easements retained by the municipality for the development of the project shall be designated on the urban renewal plat or urban renewal replat and become a part thereof.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   An urban renewal plat or urban renewal replat shall conform in all respects to the urban renewal project plan for the area in which said plat or replat may be located. An urban renewal plat or urban renewal replat, when approved by the governing body where the lands are located, shall not be rejected for the reason that any lot shown thereon fails to meet minimum requirements as to width as prescribed by Act No. 172 of the Public Acts of 1929, as amended.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   An urban renewal plat or urban renewal replat, when recorded and filed, shall be treated in respect to assessment, return of taxes and sale of lands for delinquent taxes and for all other purposes, the same as if made by the proprietor under the general provisions of Act No. 172 of the Public Acts of 1929, as amended.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 7b.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   For the purpose of providing funds to pay all or part of the cost of any project undertaken under this act or the net project cost of any project undertaken under this act with federal financial assistance, a municipality may provide by resolution duly adopted by its legislative body and without vote of the electors of the municipality for borrowing money and issuing general obligation bonds of the municipality, which bonds shall pledge the full faith and credit of the municipality.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   As used in this section:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Cost of any project" means any or all of the following items: Cost of land acquisition, demolition of buildings, land and site improvements, plans, surveys, appraisals, and all other costs relating to the acquisition, rehabilitation, financing, and disposal of any project or any part of a project under the terms of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Net project cost" means that term as defined in former section 110 of the housing act of 1949, 42 U.S.C. 1460.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The bonds may be issued and sold from time to time during the progress of any project undertaken under this act, in which event the maximum amount of bonds issued shall not exceed the estimated cost of any project undertaken under this act or the estimated net cost of any project undertaken under this act with federal assistance. The legislative body in the resolution authorizing issuance of the bonds shall set forth the estimate or the bonds may be issued when any project has been completed. Bonds issued under this section shall be designated "rehabilitation bonds". All bonds issued under this section are subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821. It being the determination of this legislature that urban blight constitutes a serious menace to public health, welfare, and safety of municipalities and their inhabitants and that the financing of projects designed to prevent or eliminate urban blight is necessary for the public health, welfare, and safety, the bonds authorized to be issued under this section are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose. The maximum principal amount of bonds that may be authorized under this section in any year shall not exceed an amount equal to 5% of the assessed value of the real and personal property in the municipality less the taxes actually levied for the year exclusive of debt service tax levies and taxes levied under other laws, and less budget bonds authorized for the year issued or authorized to be issued and less any bonds authorized in the year to be issued under sections 6a and 6b of 1949 PA 208, MCL 125.946a and 125.946b. For the purposes of this section, the assessed value of real and personal property in the municipality shall include the assessed value equivalent of money received during the municipality's fiscal year under the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921. All actions previously taken by a municipality authorizing the issuance of bonds and all bonds previously issued by a municipality are validated. Any bonds authorized to be issued under this section shall be sold not later than 3 full fiscal years from the end of the fiscal year in which the bonds are authorized to be issued. The maximum amount of bonds issued under this section that may be outstanding at any one time shall not, together with other outstanding indebtedness of the municipality, exceed the maximum limitations on bonded indebtedness of the municipality imposed by law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Except as otherwise provided in this act, the bonds shall not be subject to the provisions of any other law or charter provision relating to their issuance or sale.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The legislative body of any municipality issuing bonds under this section in the resolution authorizing issuance of the bonds shall estimate the period of usefulness of the planned improvements to be installed in the development area after the project is completed.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 14.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   For any urban renewal project initiated under this act:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Where the project was initiated prior to June 22, 1968, the local legislative body by resolution may exempt the project from the provisions of section 4, as amended, relating to district areas, citizens' district councils and coordinating councils on community redevelopment if on that date, of the persons residing in the project area at the time of project initiation and requiring relocation, 50% of such persons had relocated in accordance with law, or if on June 22, 1968, there were fewer than 100 such persons remaining to be relocated. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to a city of over 500,000 population. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Where the number of business establishments in the project area exceeds the number of occupied dwelling units in the area, the majority of the citizens' district council need not be composed of citizens living in the development area.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Where a citizens' district council is established pursuant to this act, it shall serve in lieu of and shall be deemed to satisfy all requirements relating to an urban renewal neighborhood advisory council required to be appointed pursuant to section 3 of Act No. 323 of the Public Acts of 1966, being section 125.963 of the Compiled Laws of 1948.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Where a hearing is required to be held prior to the adoption of a development plan, in the case of a neighborhood development program to be carried out under applicable regulations and guidelines of the United States department of housing and urban development, notwithstanding the notice requirements of section 4, notice of the hearing shall be deemed sufficient if such notice is distributed door-to-door and mailed to known property owners only in the specific area or areas where property is to be acquired or rehabilitated and mailed to all community organizations known to be interested in the project and posted in appropriate public buildings and appropriate other places of public gathering.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The boundaries of the district area may be revised by the local legislative body if the existing citizens' district council is notified in writing by the local legislative body at least 10 days prior to final action on the revised boundaries. If new area is included in the revised district area, persons residing in or having a demonstrable and substantial interest in the newly included area may be elected or appointed to the revised citizens' district council in the same manner of selection as the original citizens' district council. Notwithstanding the maximum size prescribed for citizens' district councils, the number of persons to be selected to represent the newly included area shall be determined by the local legislative body. If the existing citizens' district council disapproves the revised boundaries or number of persons to be elected or appointed to the revised citizens' district council and so notifies the local legislative body in writing within the 10-day period, final action on the revised boundaries or the number of persons to be elected or appointed to the revised citizens' district council shall not be taken by the local legislative body for at least 30 days after receipt of the disapproval notice, during which time the local legislative body shall consult with the citizens' district council concerning its objections. Where a district area is revised persons serving on the citizens' district council as residents of the district area who no longer reside in the revised district area shall not thereafter serve on the citizens' district council for the revised area unless they are reappointed or reelected as persons with a demonstrable and substantial interest in the revised area.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Vacancies on the citizens' district council may be filled by appointment of the chief executive officer of the municipality.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   The time provisions of section 4 are directory and not mandatory and any development plan adopted after consultation with a citizens' district council as provided in section 4 shall not be invalid because such time provisions were not strictly complied with.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   All citizens' district councils established as of the effective date of this section are validated notwithstanding noncompliance with the provisions of section 4 and all development plans heretofore adopted and all other actions heretofore taken by a municipality after consultation as required in section 4 with a citizens' district council shall not be invalid for any irregularities in the establishment, appointment or selection of such citizens' district council.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If a petition is filed within 30 days after publication of the ordinance, the clerk of the municipality determines that the petition is inadequate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If a petition is filed within 30 days after publication of the ordinance, the clerk of the municipality determines that the petition is adequate and the ordinance is approved by a majority of the registered electors of the municipality voting for the ordinance at the next regular election which supplies reasonable time for proper notices and printing of ballots, or at any special election called for that purpose. The legislative body of the municipality shall provide the manner of submitting the ordinance to the registered electors of the municipality for their approval or rejection, and determining the result of the election.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A petition under subsection (1), including the circulation and signing of the petition, is subject to section 488 of the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.488.

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>125.402 Housing law of Michigan; definitions.</B><P>
</P>
<P>Sec. 2.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Definitions. Certain words in this act are defined for the purposes thereof as follows: Words used in the present tense include the future; words in the masculine gender include the feminine and neuter; the singular number includes the plural and the plural the singular; the word "person" includes a corporation as well as a natural person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Dwelling. A "dwelling" is any house, building, structure, tent, shelter, trailer or vehicle, or portion thereof, (except railroad cars, on tracks or rights-of-way) which is occupied in whole or in part as the home, residence, living or sleeping place of 1 or more human beings, either permanently or transiently. A house trailer or other vehicle, when occupied or used as a dwelling, shall be subject to all the provisions of this act, except that house trailers or other vehicles, duly licensed as vehicles, may be occupied or used as a dwelling for reasonable periods or lengths of time, without being otherwise subject to the provisions of this act for dwellings, when located in a park or place designated or licensed for the purpose by the corporate community within which they are located: Provided, That such parking sites are equipped with adequate safety and sanitary facilities.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1a).   "Sub-standard dwelling" is a dwelling of any class which is not so equipped as to have each of the following items: running water, inside toilets; or a dwelling which has either inadequate cellar drainage, defective plumbing, and inside room having no windows therein, improper exits or defective stairways so as to make such dwelling a fire hazard.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Classes of dwellings. For the purposes of this act dwellings are divided into the following classes: (a) "private dwellings," (b) "2 family dwellings," and (c) "multiple dwellings."</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A "private dwelling" is a dwelling occupied by but 1 family, and so designed and arranged as to provide cooking and kitchen accommodations for 1 family only.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A "2 family dwelling" is a dwelling occupied by but 2 families, and so designed and arranged as to provide cooking and kitchen accommodations for 2 families only.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A "multiple dwelling" is a dwelling occupied otherwise than as a private dwelling or 2 family dwelling.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Classes of multiple dwellings. All multiple dwellings are dwellings and for the purpose of this act are divided into 2 classes, viz.: class a and class b.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Class a. Multiple dwellings of class a are dwellings which are occupied more or less permanently for residence purposes by several families and in which the rooms are occupied in apartments, suites or groups, in which each combination of rooms is so arranged and designed as to provide for cooking accommodations and toilet and kitchen sink accommodations within the separate units. This class includes tenement houses, flats, apartment houses, apartment hotels, bachelor apartments, studio apartments, duplex apartments, kitchenette apartments, and all other dwellings similarly occupied whether specifically enumerated herein or not.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Class b. Multiple dwellings of class b are dwellings which are occupied, as a rule transiently, as the more or less temporary abiding place of individuals who are lodged, with or without meals, and in which as a rule the rooms are occupied singly and without any attempt to provide therein or therewith cooking or kitchen accommodations for the individual occupants. This class includes hotels, lodging houses, boarding houses, furnished room houses, club houses, convents, asylums, hospitals, jails and all other dwellings similarly occupied, whether specifically enumerated herein or not.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3a)   Rooming house. A "rooming house" under this act shall be construed to mean any dwelling occupied in such a manner that certain rooms, in excess of those used by the members of the immediate family and occupied as a home or family unit, are leased or rented to persons outside of the family, without any attempt to provide therein or therewith, cooking or kitchen accommodations for individuals leasing or renting rooms. In the case of single and 2 family dwellings the number of such bedrooms leased or rented to roomers shall not exceed 3, unless such dwellings be made to comply in all respects with the provisions of this act relating to multiple dwellings.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Hotel. A "hotel" is a multiple-dwelling of class b in which persons are lodged for hire and in which there are more than 50 sleeping rooms, a public dining room for the accommodation of at least 50 guests, and a general kitchen. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Mixed occupancy. In cases of mixed occupancy where a building is occupied in part as a dwelling, the part so occupied shall be deemed a dwelling for the purposes of this act and shall comply with the provisions thereof relative to dwellings.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Yards. A "rear yard" is an unoccupied space on the same lot with a dwelling, between the extreme rear line of the dwelling and the rear lot line and extending from 1 side lot line to the other side lot line. A "side yard" is an unoccupied space on the same lot with a dwelling between the side lot line and the nearest side line of the dwelling and extending from the extreme rear line of the dwelling to the front lot line. A "front yard" is an unoccupied space on the same lot with a dwelling between the extreme front line of the house and the front lot line and extending from 1 side yard to the other side yard.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Courts. A "court" is an open unoccupied space on the same lot with a dwelling and bounded on 2 or more sides with the walls of the dwelling. A court not extending to the street or front or rear yard is an "inner court". A court extending to the street or front or rear yard is an "outer court". </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Corner and interior lots. A "corner lot" is a lot of which at least 2 adjacent sides abut for their full length upon a street. A lot other than a corner lot is an "interior lot."</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   Front, rear and depth of lot. The front of a lot is that boundary line which borders on the street. In case of a corner lot the owner may elect by statement on his plans either street boundary line as the front. The rear of a lot is the side opposite to the front. In the case of a triangular or gore lot the rear is the boundary line not bordering on a street. The depth of a lot is the dimension measured from the front of the lot to the extreme rear line of the lot. In the case of irregular shaped lots the mean depth shall be taken.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   Public hall. A "public hall" is a hall, corridor or passageway not within the exclusive control of 1 family.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   Stair hall. A "stair hall" is a public hall and includes the stairs, stair landings and those portions of the building through which it is necessary to pass in going between the entrance floor and the roof.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   Basement, cellar, attic, penthouses.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A "basement" is that portion of a building partly below grade but so located that the vertical distance from grade to the floor is not greater than the vertical distance from the grade to the ceiling: Provided, however, That if the vertical distance from the grade to the ceiling is 5 feet or more such basement shall be counted as a story.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A "cellar" is that portion of a building partly below grade but so located that the vertical distance from the grade to the floor is greater than the vertical distance from the grade to the ceiling: Provided, however, That if the vertical distance from the grade to the ceiling is 5 feet or more such cellar shall be counted as a story. A cellar, except as provided above, shall not be counted as a story. If any portion of a building is in that part the equivalent of a basement or cellar, the provisions of this act relative to basements and cellars shall apply to such portion of the building.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   An attic is a portion of a building situated partly or wholly in the roof space. An attic which is used only as a portion of a single or 2 family dwelling shall be not counted as a story, unless there are more than 2 rooms suitable for living purposes on this floor. For the purpose of this paragraph, rooms of 160 square feet or more will be regarded as 2 or more rooms based on each 80 square feet being considered 1 room. Any attic which is occupied by a separate family shall be counted as a story. Any attic used for living purposes in a multiple dwelling shall be counted as a story.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Penthouses. Penthouses are those portions of a building situated above the roof and housing mechanical equipment, service or recreational facilities or used for living purposes. A penthouse shall not be counted as a story if it houses only mechanical equipment or stairways and does not have an area in excess of 200 square feet; nor shall it be counted as a story, when occupied otherwise or when it has an area in excess of 200 square feet, if it complies with the following requirements: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The building and penthouse shall be of fireproof construction if the penthouse houses other than mechanical equipment or stairways.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The penthouse shall be not over 1 story in height.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The exterior walls of the penthouse shall be set back from the exterior walls of the story immediately below by a distance not less than 2/3 of the height of the penthouse above the roof. However, it shall not be necessary to set back the exterior walls of a penthouse if the dimensions of yards and courts are sufficient to meet the requirements of this act for a building if the penthouse is counted as a story.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   There shall be access to 2 stairways leading from the roof to grade where penthouses are used for the purposes other than to house mechanical equipment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The combined area of all penthouses on a building shall not exceed 25 per cent of the gross area of the floor immediately below.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   Height. The "height" of a dwelling is the perpendicular distance measured in a straight line from grade to the highest point of the roof beams in the case of flat roofs, and to the average of the height of the gable in the case of pitched roofs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(14)   Grade. "Grade", for buildings adjoining 1 street only, shall be the elevation of the sidewalk at the center of that wall which adjoins the street, except that in case the average elevation of the ground (finished surface) adjacent to the exterior walls of the building is lower than the elevation of the sidewalk, "grade" shall be the average elevation of the ground.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Grade", for buildings adjoining more than 1 street, shall be the elevation of the sidewalk at the center of the wall adjoining the street having the lowest sidewalk elevation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Grade", for buildings having no wall adjoining the street, shall be the average level of the ground (finished surface) adjacent to the exterior walls of the building.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   All walls approximately parallel to and not more than 5 feet from a street line shall be considered as adjoining the street. In alleys the surface of the paving shall be considered to be the sidewalk elevation. Where the elevation of the sidewalk or alley paving has not been established the city engineer shall determine such elevation for the purpose of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(15)   Occupied spaces. Outside stairways, fire escapes, fire towers, porches, platforms, balconies, boiler flues and other projections shall be considered as part of the building and not as a part of the yards or courts or unoccupied spaces. This provision shall not apply to 1 fireplace or 1 chimney projecting not more than 12 inches into side yard space and not more than 8 feet in length, nor to uninclosed outside porches not exceeding 1 story in height which do not extend into the front or rear yard a greater distance than 12 feet from the front or rear walls of the building, nor to 1 such porch which does not extend into the sideyard a greater distance than 6 feet from the side wall of the building nor exceed 12 feet in its other horizontal dimension, or to cornices not exceeding 16 inches in width including the gutter.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(16)   Fireproof dwelling. A "fireproof dwelling" is one the exterior walls of which are constructed of brick, stone, concrete, iron or other hard incombustible material not less than 8 inches thick, and in which there are no wood beams or lintels and in which the floors, roofs, stair halls and public halls are built entirely of brick, stone, concrete, iron or other hard incombustible material, and in which no woodwork or other inflammable material is used in any of the partitions, furrings or ceilings. But this definition shall not be construed as prohibiting elsewhere than in the public halls the use of wooden flooring on top of the fireproof floors or the use of wooden sleepers, nor as prohibiting the use of wood, or any other material not more combustible or inflammable than wood, for handrails, doors, windows, and decorative treatment on incombustible surfaces.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   All metallic structural members, except lintels unattached to structural frame work and less than 6 feet in span, shall be protected with not less than 2 inches of brick, concrete, gypsum, terra cotta, or any other material that has equivalent properties to resist the action of flame and heat. Steel in reinforced concrete construction shall be protected with a minimum of 3/4 of an inch of concrete unless additional protection is required by the enforcing official.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In dwellings not over 8 stories in height, steel joists may be used for roof and floor construction if protected on the underside with 3/4 of an inch of gypsum or portland cement plaster on metal lath, thickness of said plaster to be measured from the back of the metal lath, and protected on top with a slab of at least 2 inches of concrete in which wood sleepers may be embedded if there is at least 1 and 1/2 inches of concrete under the sleepers.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(17)   Wooden buildings. "Wooden building" is a building of which the exterior walls or a portion thereof are of wood. Court walls are exterior walls.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(18)   Nuisance. The word "nuisance" shall be held to embrace public nuisance as known at common law or in equity jurisprudence; and whatever is dangerous to human life or detrimental to health; whatever dwelling is overcrowded with occupants or is not provided with adequate ingress and egress to or from the same, or is not sufficiently supported, ventilated, sewered, drained, cleaned or lighted, in reference to its intended or actual use; and whatever renders the air or human food or drink unwholesome, are also severally, in contemplation of this act, nuisances; and all such nuisances are hereby declared illegal. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(19)   Construction of certain words. The word "shall" is always mandatory and not directory, and denotes that the dwelling shall be maintained in all respects according to the mandate as long as it continues to be a dwelling. Wherever the words "charter,""ordinances,""regulations,""superintendent of buildings,""health department,""the board of health,""health officer," or such other appropriate public official as the mayor may designate "commissioner of public safety,""commissioner of public health,""department charged with the enforcement of this act,""corporation counsel,""mayor,""city treasury," or "fire limits" occur in this act they shall be construed as if followed by the words "of the city or village in which the dwelling is situated." Wherever the words "health department,""health officer," or such other appropriate public official as the mayor may designate, or "duly authorized assistant" or "board of health,""commissioner of public safety," or "commissioner of public health" are employed in this act, such words shall be deemed and construed to mean the official or officials in any city or village to whom is committed the charge of safeguarding the public health. The terms "superintendent of buildings,""building department," and "inspector of buildings" shall embrace the department and the executive head thereof specially charged with the execution of laws and ordinances relating to the construction of buildings.

Wherever the words "dwelling,""2 family dwelling,""multiple dwelling,""building,""house,""premises" or "lot" are used in this act, they shall be construed as if followed by the words "or any part thereof." Wherever the words "city water" are used in this act, they shall be construed as meaning any public supply of water through street mains; and wherever the words "public sewer" are used in this act they shall be construed as meaning any part of a system of sewers that is used by the public, whether or not such part was constructed at the public expense. Wherever the word "street" is used in this act it shall be construed as including any public alley 16 feet or more in width. "Approved fireproof material" means as set forth by ordinances, or if not so determined, as approved by the enforcing officer. Where a particular material, device, or type of construction is specified herein, there may be substituted therefor any other material, device or type of construction of a strength, durability, performance and fire resistive qualities, equivalent to the particular material, device or type of construction specified herein, or sufficient for the intended use, and approved as such by the enforcing officer. Perforated gypsum lath 3/8 of an inch thick, with 1/2 inch of gypsum plaster may be substituted wherever metal lath and gypsum or cement plaster is required in this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(20)   Fire doors. A fire door is a movable fire resistive barrier placed on an opening in a masonry wall or shaft enclosure for the purpose of preventing the passage of fire through the opening. All fire doors, as installed and including frames and hardware shall be capable of passing a fire and water test as herein specified. The fire test shall consist of a flame applied over entire area of door which will gradually raise the temperature of the exposed side to 1400 degrees Fahrenheit during the first 20 minutes of test and which will gradually raise this temperature to 1700 degrees Fahrenheit during the next 40 minutes, concluding the fire test. Immediately thereafter and while the door is still hot, it shall be subjected to the impact of a stream of water under a nozzle pressure of 30 pounds per square inch through a 2 and 1/2 inch fire hose with a 1 and 1/8 inch smooth bore nozzle placed 20 feet from the door and played uniformly over surface of same for a period of at least 45 seconds. To pass this test, a fire door shall maintain its shape and integrity reasonably well so as to be capable of resisting the further application of flame and shall not develop serious structural weakness. The enforcing officer may require that the ability of all fire doors to pass these tests be demonstrated in a recognized testing laboratory, or that satisfactory evidence in the form of a label or certificate of test and inspection be submitted showing that the fire doors in question have successfully complied with these requirements.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   All fire doors, except those on dumbwaiters and elevators, shall be of the swinging type and shall not be double acting and shall be equipped with an approved device capable of completely and effectually closing the door under all conditions.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Type "a" fire doors shall be solid without glass panels of any kind. Type "a" fire doors may be used wherever type "b" fire doors are required herein.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Type "b" fire doors may contain not over 720 square inches of wire-glass at least 1/4 inch in thickness.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Automatic fire doors, as specified herein, may be normally held in an open position by an apparatus which will automatically allow the door to close whenever the temperature of the air at the top of the door reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Self-closing fire doors, as specified herein, shall be normally kept closed at all times.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   All fire doors shall be equipped with an effective locking device which will hold the door in the closed position but which can be unlocked from either side of the door without the use of a key.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   All fire doors shall be provided with an incombustible threshold and combustible floor construction or covering shall not extend through the door opening.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Frames for type "a" fire doors shall be made entirely of metal and no combustible material shall be used in their construction or installation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Frames for type "b" fire doors may be made of metal or of wood covered with metal.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Self-closing equipment shall consist of standard door checks or other similar approved devices which will effectually close the door without slamming.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Self-closing fire door shall be labeled on both sides in a conspicuous manner with the following words: "fire door, keep closed".</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The lessee has given consent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If a lessee who refused an inspection by the enforcing agency vacates a leasehold before an inspection by the enforcing agency, the owner of the leasehold shall notify the enforcing agency within 10 days after the leasehold is vacated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Before entering a leasehold regulated by this act, the owner of the leasehold shall request and obtain permission to enter the leasehold.

The fee shall not exceed the actual, reasonable cost of providing the inspection for which the fee is charged. An inspection fee is not required to be paid more than 6 months before the inspection is to take place. An owner or property manager is not liable for an inspection fee if the inspection is not performed and the enforcing agency is the direct cause of the failure to perform the inspection.</div>

If an enforcing agency charges a fee under this subsection, the enforcing agency shall include in the report the costs of compiling and providing the information.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) Subject to section 8, a local governmental unit may adopt an ordinance to implement this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) When used in this act as a noun, "lease" means a written or unwritten agreement or contract that sets forth the terms and conditions, rights and obligations of each party with respect to a residential dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit, building, premises, or structure that is not occupied by the owner of record.</div>

<P>Sec. 129.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Units in multiple dwellings or rooming houses shall not be occupied unless a certificate of compliance has been issued by the enforcing agency. The certificates shall be issued only upon an inspection of the premises by the enforcing agency, except as provided in section 131. The certificate shall be issued within 15 days after written application therefor if the dwelling at the date of the application is entitled thereto.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A violation of this act shall not prevent the issuance of a certificate, but the enforcing agency shall not issue a certificate when the existing conditions constitute a hazard to the health or safety of those who may occupy the premises.</DIV>

Where first occupancy will occur before the effective date of this article, inspection shall be made within 1 year after the effective date of this article. Upon a finding that there is no condition that would constitute a hazard to the health and safety of the occupants, and that the premises are otherwise fit for occupancy, the certificate shall be issued. If the finding is of a condition that would constitute a hazard to health or safety, no certificate shall be issued, and an order to comply with the act shall be issued immediately and served upon the owner in accordance with section 132. On reinspection and proof of compliance, the order shall be rescinded and a certificate issued. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    When a certificate is withheld pending compliance, no premises which have not been occupied for dwelling or rooming purposes shall be so occupied, and those premises which have been or are occupied for dwelling or rooming purposes may be ordered vacated until reinspection and proof of compliance in the discretion of the enforcing agency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A certificate of compliance shall be issued on condition that the premises remain in safe, healthful and fit condition for occupancy. If upon reinspection the enforcing agency determines that conditions exist which constitute a hazard to health or safety, the certificate shall be immediately suspended as to affected areas, and the areas may be vacated as provided in subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The duty to pay rent in accordance with the terms of any lease or agreement or under the provisions of any statute shall be suspended and the suspended rentals shall be paid into an escrow account as provided in subsection (4), during that period when the premises have not been issued a certificate of compliance, or when such certificate, once issued, has been suspended. This subsection does not apply until the owner has had a reasonable time after the effective date of this article or after notice of violations to make application for a temporary certificate, as provided in section 131. Nor does this subsection apply where the owner establishes that the conditions which constitute a hazard to health or safety were caused by the occupant or occupants. The rent, once suspended, shall again become due in accordance with the terms of the lease or agreement or statute from and after the time of reinstatement of the certificate, or where a temporary certificate has been issued, as provided in section 131.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Rents due for the period during which rent is suspended shall be paid into an escrow account established by the enforcing officer or agency, to be paid thereafter to the landlord or any other party authorized to make repairs, to defray the cost of correcting the violations. The enforcing agency shall return any unexpended part of sums paid under this section, attributable to the unexpired portion of the rental period, where the occupant terminates his tenancy or right to occupy prior to the undertaking to repair.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   When the certificate of compliance has been suspended, or has not been issued, and the rents thereafter withheld are not paid into the escrow account, actions for rent and for possession of the premises for nonpayment of rent may be maintained, subject to such defenses as the tenant or occupant may have upon the lease or contract.</DIV>

Inspection and issuance of certificates shall be in accordance with the requirements of this act and with procedures established by the enforcing agency. The enforcing agency may authorize the issuance of temporary certificates without inspection for those premises in which there are no violations of record as of the effective date of this article, and shall issue such temporary certificates upon application in cases where inspections are not conducted within a reasonable time. Temporary certificates shall also be issued for premises with violations of record, whether existing before or after the effective date of this article, when the owner can show proof of having undertaken to correct such conditions, or when the municipality has been authorized to make repairs, or when a receiver has been appointed, or when an owner rehabilitation plan has been accepted by the court.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 134.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the owner or occupant fails to comply with the order contained in the notice of violation, the enforcing agency may bring an action to enforce this act and to abate or enjoin the violation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An owner or occupant of the premises upon which a violation exists may bring an action to enforce this act in his or her own name. Upon application by the enforcing agency, or upon motion of the party filing the complaint, the local enforcing agency may be substituted for, or joined with, the complainant in the discretion of the court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the violation is uncorrected and creates an imminent danger to the health and safety of the occupants of the premises, or if there are no occupants and the violation creates an imminent danger to the health and safety of the public, the enforcing agency shall file a motion for a preliminary injunction or other temporary relief appropriate to remove the danger during the pendency of the action.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Owners and lienholders of record or owners and lienholders ascertained by the complainant with the exercise of reasonable diligence shall be served with a copy of the complaint and a summons. The complainant shall also file a notice of the pendency of the action with the appropriate county register of deeds office where the premises are located.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The court of jurisdiction shall make orders and determinations consistent with the objectives of this act. The court may enjoin the maintenance of unsafe, unhealthy, or unsanitary conditions, or violations of this act, and may order the defendant to make repairs or corrections necessary to abate the conditions. The court may authorize the enforcing agency to repair or to remove the building or structure. If an occupant is not the cause of an unsafe, unhealthy, or unsanitary condition, or a violation of this act, and is the complainant, the court may authorize the occupant to correct the violation and deduct the cost from the rent upon terms the court determines just. If the court finds that the occupant is the cause of an unsafe, unhealthy, or unsanitary condition, or a violation of this act, the court may authorize the owner to correct the violation and assess the cost against the occupant or the occupant's security deposit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A building or structure shall not be removed unless the cost of repair of the building or structure will be greater than the state equalized value of the building or structure except in urban core cities or local units of government that are adjacent to or contiguous to an urban core city that have adopted stricter standards to expedite the rehabilitation or removal of a boarded or abandoned building or structure that remains either vacant or boarded, or both, and a significant attempt has not been made to rehabilitate the building or structure for a period of 24 consecutive months.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If the expense of repair or removal is not provided for, the court may enter an order approving the expense and placing a lien on the real property for the payment of the expense. The order may establish and provide for the priority of the lien as a senior lien, except as to tax and assessment liens, and except as to a recorded mortgage of first priority, recorded prior to all other liens of record if, at the time of recording of that mortgage or at a time subsequent, a certificate of compliance as provided for in this act is in effect on the subject property. The order may also specify the time and manner for foreclosure of the lien if the lien is not satisfied. A true copy of the order shall be filed with the appropriate county register of deeds office where the real property is located within 10 days after entry of the order to perfect the lien granted in the order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   This act does not preempt, preclude, or interfere with the authority of a municipality to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public through ordinance, charter, or other means.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   As used in this section, "urban core cities" means qualified local governmental units as that term is defined in section 2 of the obsolete property rehabilitation act, 2000 PA 146, MCL 125.2782.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    When a suit has been brought to enforce this act against the owner the court may appoint a receiver of the premises.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   When the court finds that there are adequate grounds for the appointment of a receiver, it shall appoint the municipality or a proper local agency or officer, or any competent person, as receiver. In the discretion of the court no bond need be required. The receivership shall terminate at the discretion of the court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The purpose of a receivership shall be to repair, renovate and rehabilitate the premises as needed to make the building comply with the provisions of this act, and where ordered by the court, to remove a building. The receiver shall promptly comply with the charge upon him in his official capacity and restore the premises to a safe, decent and sanitary condition, or remove the building.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Subject to the control of the court the receiver shall have full and complete powers necessary to make the building comply with the provisions of this act. He may collect rents, and other revenue, hold them against the claim of prior assignees of such rents, and other revenue, and apply them to the expenses of making the building comply with the provisions of this act. He may manage and let rental units, issue receivership certificates, contract for all construction and rehabilitation as needed to make the building comply with the provisions of this act, and exercise other powers the court deems proper to the effective administration of the receivership.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   When expenses of the receivership are not otherwise provided for, the court may enter an order approving the expenses and providing that there shall be a lien on the real property for the payment thereof.

</P>
<P>Sec. 139.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   As used in sections 138 to 142, "dangerous building" means a building or structure that has 1 or more of the following defects or is in 1 or more of the following conditions:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A door, aisle, passageway, stairway, or other means of exit does not conform to the approved fire code of the city, village, or township in which the building or structure is located.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A portion of the building or structure is damaged by fire, wind, flood, deterioration, neglect, abandonment, vandalism, or other cause so that the structural strength or stability of the building or structure is appreciably less than it was before the damage and does not meet the minimum requirements of this act or a building code of the city, village, or township in which the building or structure is located for a new building or structure, purpose, or location.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A part of the building or structure is likely to fall, become detached or dislodged, or collapse and injure persons or damage property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A portion of the building or structure has settled to an extent that walls or other structural portions of the building or structure have materially less resistance to wind than is required in the case of new construction by this act or a building code of the city, village, or township in which the building or structure is located.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The building or structure, or a part of the building or structure, because of dilapidation, deterioration, decay, faulty construction, the removal or movement of some portion of the ground necessary for the support, or for other reason, is likely to partially or completely collapse, or some portion of the foundation or underpinning of the building or structure is likely to fall or give way.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The building, structure, or a part of the building or structure is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is used.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   A building or structure used or intended to be used for dwelling purposes, including the adjoining grounds, because of dilapidation, decay, damage, faulty construction or arrangement, or for other reason, is unsanitary or unfit for human habitation, is in a condition that the health officer determines is likely to cause sickness or disease, or is likely to injure the health, safety, or general welfare of people living in the dwelling.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 140.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, if a building or structure is found to be a dangerous building, the enforcing agency shall issue a notice that the building or structure is a dangerous building.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The notice shall be served on the owner, agent, or lessee that is registered with the enforcing agency under section 125.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The notice shall specify the time and place of a hearing on whether the building or structure is a dangerous building.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The hearing officer shall be appointed by the mayor, village president, or township supervisor to serve at his or her pleasure. The hearing officer shall be a person who has expertise in housing matters including, but not limited to, an engineer, architect, building contractor, building inspector, or member of a community housing organization.

</P>
<P>Sec. 141.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   At a hearing prescribed by section 140, the hearing officer shall take testimony of the enforcing agency, the owner of the property, and any interested party. Not more than 5 days after completion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall render a decision either closing the proceedings or ordering the building or structure demolished, otherwise made safe, or properly maintained.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the hearing officer determines that the building or structure should be demolished, otherwise made safe, or properly maintained, the hearing officer shall enter an order that specifies what action the owner, agent, or lessee shall take and sets a date by which the owner, agent, or lessee shall comply with the order. If the building is a dangerous building under section 139(j), the order may require the owner or agent to maintain the exterior of the building and adjoining grounds owned by the owner of the building including, but not limited to, the maintenance of lawns, trees, and shrubs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the owner, agent, or lessee fails to appear or neglects or refuses to comply with the order issued under subsection (2), the hearing officer shall file a report of the findings and a copy of the order with the legislative body of the city, village, or township not more than 5 days after the date for compliance set in the order and request that necessary action be taken to enforce the order. If the legislative body of the city, village, or township has established a board of appeals under section 141c, the hearing officer shall file the report of the findings and a copy of the order with the board of appeals and request that necessary action be taken to enforce the order. A copy of the findings and order of the hearing officer shall be served on the owner, agent, or lessee in the manner prescribed in section 140.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The legislative body or the board of appeals of the city, village, or township, as applicable, shall set a date not less than 30 days after the hearing prescribed in section 140 for a hearing on the findings and order of the hearing officer. The legislative body or the board of appeals shall give notice to the owner, agent, or lessee in the manner prescribed in section 140 of the time and place of the hearing. At the hearing, the owner, agent, or lessee shall be given the opportunity to show cause why the order should not be enforced. The legislative body or the board of appeals of the city, village, or township shall either approve, disapprove, or modify the order. If the legislative body or board of appeals approves or modifies the order, the legislative body shall take all necessary action to enforce the order. If the order is approved or modified, the owner, agent, or lessee shall comply with the order within 60 days after the date of the hearing under this subsection. For an order of demolition, if the legislative body or the board of appeals of the city, village, or township determines that the building or structure has been substantially destroyed by fire, wind, flood, deterioration, neglect, abandonment, vandalism, or other cause, and the cost of repair of the building or structure will be greater than the state equalized value of the building or structure, the owner, agent, or lessee shall comply with the order of demolition within 21 days after the date of the hearing under this subsection. If the estimated cost of repair exceeds the state equalized value of the building or structure to be repaired, a rebuttable presumption that the building or structure requires immediate demolition exists.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)    The cost of demolition includes, but is not limited to, fees paid to hearing officers, costs of title searches or commitments used to determine the parties in interest, recording fees for notices and liens filed with the county register of deeds, demolition and dumping charges, court reporter attendance fees, and costs of the collection of the charges authorized under this act. The cost of the demolition, of making the building safe, or of maintaining the exterior of the building or structure or grounds adjoining the building or structure incurred by the city, village, or township to bring the property into conformance with this act shall be reimbursed to the city, village, or township by the owner or party in interest in whose name the property appears.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The owner or party in interest in whose name the property appears upon the last local tax assessment records shall be notified by the assessor of the amount of the cost of the demolition, of making the building safe, or of maintaining the exterior of the building or structure or grounds adjoining the building or structure by first class mail at the address shown on the records. If the owner or party in interest fails to pay the cost within 30 days after mailing by the assessor of the notice of the amount of the cost, the city, village, or township shall have a lien for the cost incurred by the city, village, or township to bring the property into conformance with this act. The lien shall not take effect until notice of the lien has been filed or recorded as provided by law. A lien provided for in this subsection does not have priority over previously filed or recorded liens and encumbrances. The lien for the cost shall be collected and treated in the same manner as provided for property tax liens under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   In addition to other remedies under this act, the city, village, or township may bring an action against the owner of the building or structure for the full cost of the demolition, of making the building safe, or of maintaining the exterior of the building or structure or grounds adjoining the building or structure. A city, village, or township shall have a lien on the property for the amount of a judgment obtained under this subsection. The lien provided for in this subsection shall not take effect until notice of the lien is filed or recorded as provided by law.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Any city, village, township or county may create by ordinance, a commission with power to accomplish the purposes set forth in section 2 of this act. Any ordinance hereafter enacted shall not go into effect until 15 days after it has been published in a newspaper of general circulation in such city, village, township or county and posted in 3 public places in such city, village, township or county. If there is no newspaper of general circulation in any such city, village or township such publication may be had in any newspaper having general circulation in the county in which the city, village, or township is situated. If, before such ordinance goes into effect, a petition signed by a number of the qualified electors of such city, village, township or county equal to at least 3% of the number of voters registered for the last regular city, village, township or county election is filed with the clerk of the city, village, township or county requesting that the question of the creation of such commission be submitted to the voters of the city, village, township or county, the clerk of the city, village, township or county shall immediately call a special election for that purpose, unless a general election is to be held in such city, village, township or county within 30 days from the date of the filing of the petition, in which event the question shall be submitted at such general election.

Written notice of all claims based upon injury to persons or property shall be served upon the city or village clerk within 60 days from the happening of the injury. The commission may dispose of claims in its discretion.

</P>
<P>Sec. 17.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   For the purpose of defraying the cost of purchasing, acquiring, constructing, improving, enlarging, extending, or repairing any housing project or combined projects, any borrower may borrow money and issue revenue bonds. The bonds may be awarded before an authorizing ordinance or resolution is adopted; however, the bonds shall not be issued unless and until authorized by an ordinance or resolution setting forth a brief description of the contemplated housing project or combined projects and the site or sites of the project or projects, time and place of payment, and other details in connection with the issuance and sale of the bonds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as otherwise provided by this act, the bonds issued under this act are subject to the revenue bond act of 1933, 1933 PA 94, MCL 141.101 to 141.140. If less than all of the bonds authorized in connection with a project or combined projects are sold to the United States housing authority or a successor agency, the balance of the bonds may also be sold at private sale at an interest cost to the borrower of not more than the interest cost to the borrower of the portion of the bonds sold to the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality of the United States of America.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Notes issued in connection with a housing project or combined projects prior to the issuance of bonds may be accepted in payment of bonds sold in connection with the housing project or combined projects if the notes provide. In a contract for the purchase, acquisition, or construction of any housing facility or for the improvement, enlargement, extension, or repair of the project or projects, provision may be made that payment shall be made in the bonds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The bonds may be made payable in funds that are on the respective dates of payment of interest and principal upon the bonds, legal tender for debts due the United States of America. All bonds and notes issued under this act, the interest on the bonds and notes, and their transfer are exempt from all taxation by this state or any political subdivisions of this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The principal of and interest upon the bonds shall be payable, except as provided in this act, solely from the revenue derived from the operation of the housing project or combined projects, for the purchase, acquisition, construction, improvement, enlargement, extension, or repair of which the bonds are issued, and from contributions received for or in aid of the project or combined projects, from whatever source derived. The contributions may be pledged to the payment of any or all bonds issued in connection with the project or combined projects, as the borrower may provide. Bonds issued pursuant to this act shall not constitute an indebtedness of a borrower within the meaning of state constitutional provisions or statutory limitations. There shall be plainly stated on the face of each bond substantially as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   "This bond is a revenue bond and the principal of and interest on this bond are exempt from any and all state, county, city, village, or other taxation under the laws of this state and are secured by the statutory lien created by 1933 (Ex Sess) PA 18, MCL 125.651 to 125.709c, and payable solely from contributions received for or in aid of the project or combined projects in connection with which the bonds are issued or from the revenues of the project or combined projects or from both the revenues and contributions, as the case may be, and are not a general obligation of the borrower."</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The bonds shall have all the qualities of negotiable instruments under the uniform commercial code, 1962 PA 174, MCL 440.1101 to 440.11102. The authorizing ordinance or resolution may provide that the bonds shall be issued under a trust indenture, the authorized form of which shall be set forth in the ordinance or resolution, and any provision required or permitted by this act to appear in the authorizing ordinance or resolution shall be considered to be included in the ordinance or resolution if set forth in the trust indenture.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 27.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    It is hereby declared to be the policy of this state that each commission shall manage and operate, or cause to be managed and operated, its housing projects in an efficient manner so as to enable it to fix the rentals for dwelling accommodations at the lowest possible rates consistent with its providing decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling accommodations, and that no commission shall construct or operate any project for profit. To this end, the commission shall fix the rentals for dwellings in projects at no higher rates than it finds to be necessary in order to produce revenues which, together with all other money, revenues, income, and receipts from whatever sources derived available for such purposes, will be sufficient to do the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Pay, as they become due, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds or notes issued for such project.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Meet the cost of and provide for administration, operation, and maintenance of the projects, including the cost of any insurance on the projects or on bonds issued for the projects, and for the creation and funding of a reserve for replacements and capital improvements related to the projects.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Create, during not less than the 6 years immediately succeeding its issuance of any bonds, a reserve sufficient to meet the largest principal and interest payments which will be due on the bonds in any 1 year thereafter and to maintain such reserve.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Make payments in lieu of taxes of an amount as may be imposed pursuant to section 11a by the incorporating unit, which sum, if any, shall be paid to the incorporating unit and other taxing units in proportion to the amount of taxes levied by that incorporating unit and the other taxing units in the year in which the payment in lieu of taxes is imposed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   After bonds issued for a project have been retired, the rentals fixed by the commission pursuant to subsection (1) may include an amount not greater than the maximum annual principal and interest that had been due on bonds issued for the project. The rental receipts attributable to this subsection may be used by the commission for any purpose for which bonds or notes may be issued under this act or to secure bonds or notes issued by the borrower pursuant to this act for other projects of the commission.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   It is declared that in the cities of the state substandard and insanitary areas exist which have resulted from inadequate planning, excessive land coverage, lack of proper light, air, and open space, pollution, neglect, defective design and arrangement of buildings, lack of proper sanitary facilities, and the existence of buildings, which, by reason of age, obsolescence, inadequate or outmoded design, or physical deterioration, have become economic or social liabilities, or both; that such conditions are prevalent in areas where substandard, insanitary, outworn or outmoded industrial, commercial or residential buildings and polluted and neglected water courses prevail, and are conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant mortality, juvenile delinquency, crime and poverty; that such conditions impair the economic value of large areas, infecting them with economic blight, and that such areas are characterized by depreciated values, impaired investments, and reduced capacity to pay taxes; that such conditions are chiefly in areas which are so subdivided into small parcels in divided ownerships and frequently with defective titles, that their assembly for purposes of clearance, replanning, rehabilitation and reconstruction is difficult and costly; that the existence of such conditions and the failure to clear, replan, rehabilitate or reconstruct these areas result in a loss of population in some areas, and congestion and over-crowding in other areas and further deterioration, accompanied by added costs to the communities for creation of new public facilities and services elsewhere; that it is difficult and uneconomic for individual owners independently to undertake to remedy such conditions; that it is desirable to encourage owners of property or holders of claims thereon in such areas to join together and with outsiders in corporate groups for the purpose of the clearance, replanning, rehabilitation, modernization, improvement and reconstruction of such areas by joint action; that it is necessary to create, with proper safeguards, inducements and opportunities for the employment of private investment and equity capital in the clearance, replanning, rehabilitation, modernization, improvement and reconstruction of such areas; that such conditions require the employment of such capital on an investment rather than a speculative basis, allowing, however, the widest latitude in the amortization of any indebtedness created thereby; that such conditions further require the acquisition at fair prices of adequate areas, the gradual clearance of such areas through demolition of existing obsolete, inadequate, unsafe and insanitary buildings and the redevelopment of such areas under proper supervision with appropriate planning, land use and construction policies; that the clearance, replanning, rehabilitation, modernization, improvement and reconstruction of such areas on a large scale basis are necessary for the public welfare; that the clearance, replanning, reconstruction, modernization, improvement and rehabilitation of such areas are public uses and purposes for which private property may be acquired; that such substandard and insanitary areas constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals, welfare and reasonable comfort of the citizens of the state; that such conditions require the creation of the agencies, instrumentalities and corporations hereinafter described, which are hereby declared to be agencies and instrumentalities of the state, for the purpose of attaining the ends herein recited; that the protection and promotion of the health, safety, morals, welfare and reasonable comfort of the citizens of the state are matters of public concern; and the necessity in the public interest for the provisions hereinafter enacted is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.   No development shall be initiated until certificates of approval of the development plan therefor shall have been issued by both the planning commission and the supervising agency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;3.   A planning commission may approve a development plan, but no certificate of approval thereof shall be issued by it unless and until an application for approval has been filed with it, together with the development plan, and unless and until the planning commission shall determine:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That the area within which the development area is included is substandard or insanitary or is polluted or neglected and that the redevelopment of the development area in accordance with the development plan is necessary or advisable to effectuate the public purposes declared in section 2;</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Any such determination shall be conclusive evidence of the facts so determined except upon proof of fraud or wilful misfeasance. In arriving at such determination, the planning commission shall consider only those elements of the development plan relevant to such determination under subparagraphs (a) through (g) of this paragraph 3 of section 4 and to the type of development which is physically desirable for the development area concerned from a city planning viewpoint, and from a neighborhood unit viewpoint if the development plan provides that the development area is to be primarily residential. Upon approval of a development plan by the planning commission, it shall forthwith issue a certificate of approval thereof.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A planning commission may state general standards of city and neighborhood unit planning to which a development plan should conform to be approved by it. Such standards, however, shall be as flexible as possible and only for the guidance of prospective proponents of development plans. Variations therefrom shall be freely allowed upon a showing of their advisability, to the end that individual initiative be encouraged.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;4.   A supervising agency may approve a development plan, but no certificate of approval thereof shall be issued by it unless and until the planning commission shall first have approved thereof and there has been filed with the supervising agency the development plan, the certificate of approval by the planning commission and an application for approval by the supervising agency, and unless and until the supervising agency shall determine:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That the proposed method of financing the development is feasible and that it is probable that the redevelopment corporation will be able to finance or arrange to finance the development;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   That the persons who it is proposed will be active in or associated with the management of the redevelopment corporation during a period of at least 1 year from the date of the approval of the development plan have sufficient ability and experience to cause the development to be undertaken, consummated and managed in a satisfactory manner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Any such determination shall be conclusive evidence of the facts so determined except upon proof of fraud or wilful misfeasance. In considering whether or not a certificate of approval of the development plan shall be issued, the supervising agency shall consider only those elements of the development plan relevant to such determination under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph 4 of section 4. Upon approval of a development plan by the supervising agency, it shall forthwith issue a certificate of approval thereof.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;5.   The planning commission and the supervising agency may approve an amendment or amendments to a development plan, but no such amendment to a development plan which has theretofore been approved by the planning commission and the supervising agency shall be approved unless and until an application therefor has been filed with the planning commission or the supervising agency by the redevelopment corporation containing that part of the material required by paragraph 1 of this section 4 which shall be relevant to the proposed amendment, and unless and until the planning commission or the supervising agency, as the case may be, shall make the determinations required by paragraph 3 or 4 of this section 4 which shall be relevant to the proposed amendment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;6.   The planning commission and the supervising agency may each adopt a schedule of fees to be paid upon the filing of the development plan, amendments thereto and other instruments in connection therewith. The amount of these fees shall not exceed the reasonable cost of the examining, inspectional and supervisory services required under this act.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;1.   At any time 1 or more natural persons, corporations or partnerships may incorporate a redevelopment corporation on making, subscribing, acknowledging and filing in the corporation and securities commission a certificate pursuant to the general corporation law, which shall be entitled and endorsed "certificate of incorporation of ............ redevelopment corporation, pursuant to the general corporation law," the blank space being filled in with the remainder of the name of the corporation. Such certificate shall contain the provisions required in, and may contain any provisions consistent with the provisions of this act permitted in, a certificate of incorporation filed pursuant to the general corporation law, except that:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Included among the purposes for which the corporation is formed shall be the formulation, obtaining the approval of, and putting into effect of a development plan, the acquisition of real property in a development area, and the construction, maintenance and operation of a development pursuant to this act;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The duration of the corporation shall not be less than 20 years;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The certificate may provide for the issuance of income debentures, in which case the holders of such debentures may be allowed such voting rights as shall be specified therein;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The certificate may provide that the corporation shall have the power to cooperate with and participate in any programs of the federal or state governments which have been or may be enacted for purposes of the development or redevelopment of areas of cities which are substandard, insanitary, polluted or neglected. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The certificate may provide that the corporation shall have the power to guarantee, purchase, hold, sell, assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge or otherwise dispose of any bonds, securities or evidence of indebtedness created by any person or other legal entity related to properties or businesses located in the redevelopment area.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The certificate shall contain a declaration that the redevelopment corporation has been organized to serve a public purpose, and that it shall be subject to supervision and control as provided in this act. A copy of such certificate shall be filed with the planning commission and the supervising agency having jurisdiction within 10 days of its being filed in the corporation and securities commission. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.   At any time any domestic corporation which is not a redevelopment corporation, but which has been incorporated pursuant to the general corporation law may become a redevelopment corporation by filing an appropriate certificate or certificates pursuant to the general corporation law changing the provisions of its certificate of incorporation to eliminate any provisions therein inconsistent with the provisions of this act and adding or substituting the provisions required by this section by changing its name to a name corresponding to the form ".......................... redevelopment corporation," and making all the other changes necessary to enable it to conform with all of the provisions of this act. Any such certificate shall be prepared and filed pursuant to the general corporation law, except that in addition to citing such law in the title of such certificate, the title shall also state that it is being made pursuant to section 6.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;3.   If a redevelopment corporation shall not have obtained the certificates of approval of its development plan required by section 4 within 12 months of the date upon which it became a redevelopment corporation, or shall not substantially comply with the development plan within the time limit for the completion of each stage thereof as therein stated, reasonable delays caused by unforeseen difficulties excepted, then upon the filing in the department of state of a certified copy of the order of the court establishing such failure to obtain such certificate or substantially so to comply, obtained pursuant to section 14, such redevelopment corporation shall cease to have the special rights, powers and privileges granted to, or be subject to the special duties, liabilities and restrictions imposed upon, a redevelopment corporation by this act, and shall thereafter change its name to remove the word "redevelopment" therefrom. In such event, however, such corporation may thereafter continue in existence as a corporation, subject to the general corporation law. In the event that a certified copy of such order shall be so filed, all real property acquired by or for such redevelopment corporation by condemnation shall be disposed of, either alone or in conjunction with additional real property not so acquired, within a reasonable time by bona fide sale conducted in such a manner as may be prescribed by ordinance of the local legislative body. All amounts received by the redevelopment corporation for such real property in excess of an amount equal to that portion of the development cost allocable to the real property being disposed of, shall be paid to the city.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;4.   No corporation now organized under the laws of the state shall change its name to a name, and no such corporation hereafter organized shall have a name, containing the word "redevelopment" as a part thereof, unless and until such corporation is or becomes a redevelopment corporation. No foreign corporation now authorized to do business in the state shall change its name to a name, and no such corporation shall hereafter be authorized to do business in the state with a name, containing the word "redevelopment" as a part thereof.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 12.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    A local legislative body is authorized by the adoption or enactment of an ordinance or local law to exempt real property located within the city or township owned by a redevelopment corporation or a qualified entity during a maximum exemption period that shall not exceed 40 years from any increase in assessed value over the maximum assessed value. After the adoption or enactment of the ordinance or local law, every parcel of real property owned by any redevelopment corporation or a qualified entity in a development shall be exempt during the maximum exemption period from any increase in assessed value over or in excess of the maximum assessed value. An exemption described in this subsection shall not, however, apply to any improvement made upon the real property after the beginning of the maximum exemption period but the local legislative body may, by appropriate legislative action, establish a maximum assessed value and maximum exemption period, not to exceed 40 years, for those subsequent improvements.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For the purpose of fixing the date of commencement of the maximum exemption period for a group of parcels of real property in a development area, the city or township is authorized with the approval of its local legislative body to contract with a redevelopment corporation to place in 1 or more groups the various parcels of real property in a development area. A contract described in this subsection may provide that all the parcels in each group shall be considered to have a common stated date of completion of the development by the redevelopment corporation or qualified entity.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A development plan may include property located in a township only if that property was previously used by this state for an office, hospital, prison, institution of higher education, or other state facility.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   For purposes of this section, "qualified entity" means either of the following: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A Michigan nonprofit corporation or a Michigan limited partnership having a Michigan nonprofit corporation as its sole general partner, if 1 or more of the following apply: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   A majority of each class of stock in the nonprofit corporation is owned by the redevelopment corporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)    A majority of the members of the board of directors of the nonprofit corporation are elected and removable by the redevelopment corporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)    The redevelopment corporation is the sole member of the nonprofit corporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A for-profit corporation, partnership, or limited liability company formed or incorporated by the redevelopment corporation for the sole purpose of syndicating historic tax credits or low-income housing tax credits in connection with the redevelopment of a property that has been owned by the redevelopment corporation, if the redevelopment corporation maintains oversight responsibility for the management and operation of the property for which historic tax credits or low-income housing tax credits were syndicated and the for-profit entity does not engage in any other business activity unrelated to the property.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 17.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;1.   When it is desired that any real property in a development area be acquired by condemnation, there shall be presented to the supervising agency by the redevelopment corporation a verified petition requesting the issuance of a certificate of approval of condemnation of such real property which shall contain, among other things:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A metes and bounds description or other legal description of the real property involved and a statement of the estate, interest, privileges, franchise or right therein or appurtenant thereto to be condemned;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Proof that such real property is within the development area;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Proof that certificates of approval of the development plan required by section 4 have been issued.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The supervising agency shall determine within a reasonable time thereafter the truth or sufficiency of the statements and proof contained in such petition, and, if such determination shall be in the affirmative, the supervising agency shall issue to the petitioner a certificate of approval of condemnation. Such certificate shall contain a description of the real property proposed to be condemned, the facts so determined with respect thereto, and a statement that the real property proposed to be condemned is required for a public use and that its acquisition for such use is necessary. No condemnation proceeding to acquire real property in a development area, by a city for a redevelopment corporation, shall be commenced until such a certificate of approval of condemnation shall have been issued.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.   Condemnation proceedings for a redevelopment corporation shall be initiated by a petition to the city to institute proceedings to acquire for the redevelopment corporation any real property in the development area. Such petition shall be granted or rejected by the local legislative body, and the resolution or resolutions granting such petition shall contain a requirement that the redevelopment corporation shall pay to the city all sums expended or required to be expended by the city in the acquisition of such real property, together with all costs incurred by the city, and the time of payment and manner of securing payment thereof, and may require that the city shall receive, before proceeding with the acquisition of such real property, such assurances as to payment or reimbursement by the redevelopment corporation, or otherwise, as the city may deem advisable. Upon the passage of a resolution or resolutions by the local legislative body, granting the petition, the redevelopment corporation shall cause to be made 3 copies of surveys or maps of the real property described in the petition, 1 of which shall be filed in the office of the redevelopment corporation, 1 in the office of the corporation counsel or chief law officer of the city, and 1 in the office in which instruments affecting real property in the county are recorded. The filing of such copies of surveys or maps shall constitute the acceptance by the redevelopment corporation of the terms and conditions contained in such ordinance or ordinances. The city shall proceed under any provision of any general, special or local law applicable to the condemnation of real property for public improvements. When title to the real property shall have vested in the city, it shall convey the same to the redevelopment corporation upon payment by the redevelopment corporation of the sums and the giving of the security required by the resolution granting the petition. As soon as title shall have vested in the city, the redevelopment corporation may, upon the authorization of the local legislative body enter upon the real property taken, take over and dispose of existing improvements, and carry out the terms of the development plan with respect thereto.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;3.   The following provisions shall apply to any proceedings for the assessment of compensation and damages for real property in a development area taken or to be taken by condemnation for a redevelopment corporation:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Evidence of the price and other terms upon any sale, offer to sell, or the rent received or reserved, whichever is less, and other terms upon any sales option, lease or tenancy relating to any of the real property taken or to be taken or to any comparable real property in the vicinity when the option, sale, offer or lease was given, occurred or the tenancy existed, within a reasonable time of the trial, shall be admissible on direct examination;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Any time during the pendency of such action or proceeding, the redevelopment corporation, the city or any owner may apply to the court for an order directing any owner, the redevelopment corporation, or the city, as the case may be, to show cause why further proceedings should not be expedited, and the court may upon such application make an order requiring that the hearings proceed and that any other steps be taken with all possible expedition;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   For the purposes of this act, the award of compensation shall not be increased by reason of any increase in the value of the real property caused by the assembly, clearance or reconstruction, or proposed assembly, clearance or reconstruction for the purposes of this act of the real property in the development area. No allowance shall be made for the improvements begun on real property after notice to the owner of such property of the institution of the proceedings to condemn such property;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Evidence shall be admissible bearing upon the insanitary, unsafe or substandard condition of the premises, or the illegal use thereof, or the enhancement of rentals from such illegal use, and such evidence may be considered in fixing the compensation to be paid, notwithstanding that no steps to remedy or abate such conditions have been taken by the department or officers having jurisdiction. If a violation order is on file against the premises in any such department, it shall constitute prima facie evidence of the existence of the condition specified in such order;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   If any of the real property in the development area which is to be acquired by condemnation has, prior to such acquisition, been devoted to another public use, it may nevertheless be acquired provided that no real property belonging to the city or to any other governmental body, or agency or instrumentality thereof, corporate or otherwise, may be acquired without its consent;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Upon the trial, evidence of the price and other terms upon a sale or assignment or of a contract for the sale or assignment of a mortgage, award, proposed award, transfer of a tax lien or lien of a judgment relating to property taken, shall be relevant, material and competent, upon the issue of value or damage and shall be admissible on direct examination;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Upon the trial a statement, affidavit, deposition, report, transcript of testimony in an action or proceeding, or appraisal made or given by any owner or prior owner of the premises taken, or by any person on his behalf, to any court, governmental bureau, department or agency respecting the value of the real property for tax purposes, shall be relevant, material and competent upon the issue of value of damage and shall be admissible on direct examination; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   The term "owner," as used in this section, shall include a person having an estate, interest or easement in the real property to be acquired or a lien, charge or encumbrance thereon.</DIV>

Such occupation or use shall not be construed as a tenancy from month to month, nor require the giving of notice by the redevelopment corporation or the city, as the case may be, for the termination of such occupation or use or the right to such occupation or use, but immediately upon the expiration of the term for which payment has been made the redevelopment corporation or city, as the case may be, shall be entitled to possession of the real property and may maintain summary proceedings, obtain a writ of assistance, and shall be entitled to such other remedy as may be provided by law for obtaining immediate possession thereof. A former owner, tenant or other person occupying or using such property shall not be required to give notice to the redevelopment corporation or city, as the case may be, at the expiration of the term for which he has made payment for such occupation or use, as a condition to his cessation of occupation or use and termination of liability therefor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In the event that a city has acquired real property for a redevelopment corporation, the city shall, in transferring title to the redevelopment corporation, deduct from the consideration or other moneys which the redevelopment corporation has become obligated to pay to the city for such purpose, and credit the redevelopment corporation with the amounts received by the city as payment for temporary occupation and use of the real property by a former owner, tenant, or other person, as in this section 18 provided, less the cost and expense incurred by the city for the maintenance and operation of such real property.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a local governmental unit elects to levy special assessments to defray all or part of the cost of the district project, then the special assessments shall be levied pursuant to applicable statutory or charter provisions or, if there are no applicable statutory or charter provisions, pursuant to statutory or charter provisions applicable to local governmental unit street improvements. If a local governmental unit charter does not authorize special assessments for the purposes set forth in this chapter, the charter provisions authorizing special assessments for street improvements are made applicable to the purposes set forth in this chapter, without amendment to the charter. The total amount assessed for district purposes may be made payable in not more than 20 annual installments as determined by the governing body of the local governmental unit, the first installment to be payable in not more than 18 months after the date of the confirmation of the special assessment roll.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A special assessment shall be levied against assessable property on the basis of the special benefits to that parcel from the total project. There is a rebuttable presumption that a district project specially benefits all assessable property located within the district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) This subsection applies to a principal shopping district only if the principal shopping district is designated by the governing body of a local governmental unit after July 14, 1992. The special assessments annually levied on a parcel under this chapter shall not exceed the product of $10,000.00 and the number of businesses on that parcel. A business located on a single parcel shall not be responsible for a special assessment in excess of $10,000.00 annually. When the special assessment district is created, a lessor of a parcel subject to a special assessment may unilaterally revise an existing lease to a business located on that parcel to recover from that business all or part of the special assessment, as is proportionate considering the portion of the parcel occupied by the business.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The $10,000.00 maximum amounts in subsection (3) shall be adjusted each January 1, beginning January 1, 1994, pursuant to the annual average percentage increase or decrease in the Detroit Consumer Price Index for all items as reported by the United States Department of Labor. The adjustment for each year shall be made by comparing the Detroit Consumer Price Index for the 12-month period ending the preceding October 31 with the corresponding Detroit Consumer Price Index of 1 year earlier. The percentage increase or decrease shall then be multiplied by the current amounts under subsection (3) authorized by this section. The product shall be rounded up to the nearest multiple of 50 cents and shall be the new amount.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The local governmental unit may issue special assessment bonds in anticipation of the collection of the special assessments for a district project and, by action of its governing body, may pledge its full faith and credit for the prompt payment of the bonds. Special assessment bonds issued under this section are subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821. The last maturity on the bonds shall be not later than 2 years after the due date of the last installment on the special assessments. Special assessment bonds may be issued pursuant to statutory or charter provisions applicable to the issuance by the local governmental unit of special assessment bonds for the improvement or, if there are no applicable statutory or charter provisions, pursuant to statutory or charter provisions applicable to the issuance by the local governmental unit of special assessment bonds for street improvements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a district project in a district designated by the governing body of a local governmental unit after July 14, 1992 is financed by special assessments, the governing body of the local governmental unit shall review the special assessments every 5 years, unless special assessment bonds are outstanding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Before a local governmental unit levies a special assessment under this chapter that benefits property within a business improvement district, the business improvement district board shall develop a marketing and development plan that details all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The scope, nature, and duration of the business improvement district project or projects.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The different classes of property owners who are going to be assessed and the projected amount of the special assessment on the different classes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A local governmental unit that levies a special assessment under this chapter that benefits property within a business improvement district is considered to have approved the marketing and development plan described in subsection (7).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Any notice required as part of the special assessment process shall include a statement that a property owner of residential real property within a business improvement district may seek a homestead deferment for a special assessment under this act in the same manner as provided in section 4 of 1976 PA 225, MCL 211.764.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) All property owners as of the date of the delivery of the petition as provided in section 10c are eligible to participate in the election. The election must be conducted by mail. The question to be voted on by the property owners is the adoption of the zone plan and the establishment of the business improvement zone, including the identity of the initial board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A zone plan and the proposal for the establishment of a business improvement zone, including the identity of the initial board, are considered adopted upon the approval of more than 60% of the property owners voting in the election, using proportional voting if applicable under the zone plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Upon acceptance or rejection of a business improvement zone and zone plan by the property owners, the resulting business improvement zone or the person filing the petition under section 10c shall, at the request of the city or village, reimburse the city or village for all or a portion of the reasonable expenses incurred to comply with this chapter.

A business improvement zone created under this chapter shall comply with all applicable state and federal laws.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) To the extent not protected by the immunity conferred by 1964 PA 170, MCL 691.1401 to 691.1419, a city or village that approves a business improvement zone within its boundaries is immune from civil or administrative liability arising from any actions of that business improvement zone.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Subject to subsection (8), if a zone plan provides for proportional voting, the proportional vote of a property owner must be allocated as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the zone plan for the zone area provides a basis for allocating assessments based upon taxable value, the votes of property owners may be proportionate to the amount that the taxable value of their respective real property for the preceding calendar year bears to the taxable value of all assessable property in the zone area for that calendar year. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the zone plan for the zone area provides for allocation of assessments based upon assessed value, the votes of property owners may be proportionate to the amount that the assessed value of their respective real property for the preceding calendar year bears to the assessed value of all assessable property in the zone area for that calendar year. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the zone plan for the zone area provides a basis for allocating assessments other than taxable value or assessed value, the votes of property owners may be proportionate to the amount that the assessment for their respective real property for the prior calendar year bears to the total value of assessments for assessable property in the zone area in that calendar year. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The proportional vote allocated to any 1 property owner must not exceed 25% of the total vote. If the proportional vote of a single property owner under this section exceeds 25%, the amount in excess of 25% must be reallocated among the remaining property owners in proportion to the amount that the assessment of their respective assessable property for the prior calendar year bears to the assessment of all assessable property in the zone area owned by the remaining property owners during that calendar year. For purposes of this subsection, property owners that are affiliates shall be treated as a single property owner. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) As used in this section, "affiliate" means that term as defined in section 90l of the Michigan strategic fund act, 1984 PA 270, MCL 125.2090l.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A business improvement zone may be funded in whole or in part by 1 or more assessments on assessable property, as provided in the zone plan. An assessment under this chapter is in addition to any taxes or special assessments otherwise imposed on assessable property. The business improvement zone, with the approval of the board, may enter into agreements with 1 or more property owners in the city or village providing for the provision of business zone activities or services to the property owner or owners by the business improvement zone in exchange for monetary contributions to the business improvement zone from the property owner or owners. An agreement providing for the provision of business zone activities or services described in this subsection must be in writing and must be made available to all property owners of assessable property in the zone area.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An assessment may be imposed against assessable property only on the basis of the benefits to assessable property afforded by the zone plan. There is a rebuttable presumption that a zone plan and any project specially benefits all assessable property in a zone area.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a zone plan provides for an assessment, the treasurer of the city or village in which the zone area is located as an agent of the business improvement zone shall collect the assessment imposed by the board under the zone plan on all assessable property within the zone area in the amount authorized by the zone plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The treasurer of the city or village in which the zone area is located, as an agent of the business improvement zone, shall collect the assessments from each property owner within the zone area and promptly remit the assessments collected to the business improvement zone. Assessment revenue is the property of the business improvement zone and not the city or village in which the business improvement zone is located. However, all payments to the treasurer shall be entirely applied first to the balance of any property taxes owed to the city or village and only then any remaining payment amount shall be considered assessment revenue belonging to the business improvement zone and applied to the assessment levied under this chapter. The business improvement zone may, at the option and under the direction of the treasurer, assist the treasurer of the city or village in collecting the assessment to minimize the expenses of collecting the assessment incurred by the city or village.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The business improvement zone may institute a civil action to collect any delinquent assessment and interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An assessment is delinquent if it has not been paid within 90 days after it was due as provided under the zone plan imposed under this chapter. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (7), the business improvement zone shall collect delinquent assessments. Delinquent assessments accrue interest at a rate of 1.5% per month until paid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If any portion of the assessment has not been paid within 90 days after it was due, that portion of the unpaid assessment is a lien on the property. The lien amount is for the unpaid portion of the assessment and includes any applicable interest. Alternatively, a delinquent and unpaid assessment may, at the request of the business improvement zone, be returned as delinquent by the treasurer of the city or village and collected in the same manner as a delinquent tax special assessment along with any associated interest, fees, and costs under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155. However, property is not subject to forfeiture, foreclosure, and sale under sections 78 to 79a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.78 to 211.79a, for nonpayment of an assessment under this chapter unless the property also is subject to forfeiture, foreclosure, and sale under sections 78 to 79a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.78 to 211.79a, for delinquent property taxes. If a parcel of assessable property that has a delinquent and unpaid assessment is sold to a purchaser who is not related or affiliated to the seller, as determined by the board, the board may reduce or eliminate any delinquent and unpaid assessment on that parcel of assessable property if the property is not subject to forfeiture, foreclosure, and sale under sections 78 to 79a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.78 to 211.79a. If the delinquent property taxes are paid, the property may not be forfeited, foreclosed, and sold for an unpaid assessment under this chapter.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   There exists in this state the continuing need for programs of water and air pollution control and solid waste disposal facilities for industries and public utilities in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the state, and it is necessary to promote and encourage the acquisition, purchase, construction, reconstruction, enlarging, remodeling, improving, repairing, operation, and maintenance of adequate and proper water and air pollution control equipment and solid waste disposal facilities for industrial buildings and the facilities of public utilities now or hereafter located in this state. The authority and powers conferred by this act, including the powers conferred with respect to the acquisition, purchase, construction, reconstruction, enlarging, remodeling, improving, repairing, operation, and maintenance of pollution control facilities and the financing thereof whether by purchase, sale, lease, or otherwise, including pollution control facilities heretofore acquired, under construction, placed in operation, or completed by any person, firm, corporation, or public utility, and the issuance of bonds for the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds, constitutes such a necessary program and serves a valid public purpose. A municipality may do any or all of the following: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Construct, acquire by gift or purchase, reconstruct, improve, enlarge, maintain, remodel, repair, or operate and maintain any pollution control facilities or portion thereof within or without the municipality whether the pollution control facilities have been or are operating, are under construction, or are completed. The interest of the municipality in the pollution control facilities leased or sold to a public utility may be subject or may be made subject to a mortgage, lien, security interest, or encumbrance given or made by a public utility from which the municipality acquired its interest or which, under an agreement made pursuant to subdivision (c), has or may acquire an interest in the pollution control facilities.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Issue revenue bonds under, subject to, and in accordance with this act to finance, in whole or in part, the costs of acquisition, purchase, construction, reconstruction, enlarging, remodeling, improving, or repair of pollution control facilities referred to in subdivision (a), or to refund outstanding bonds, or partly to finance, in whole or in part, the costs of acquisition, purchase, construction, reconstruction, enlarging, remodeling, improving or repair of pollution control facilities referred to in subdivision (a) and partly to refund outstanding bonds. The revenue bonds may be issued by a municipality to finance the costs of the acquisition, purchase, construction, reconstruction, enlarging, remodeling, improving, or repair of pollution control facilities located or to be located in 1 or more places within or without the municipality issuing the revenue bonds. Revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section may be issued solely for the acquisition, purchase, construction, reconstruction, enlarging, remodeling, improving, or repair of pollution control facilities referred to in subdivision (a), notwithstanding that the municipality does not own or propose to own the industrial buildings or public utility facilities, including lands or interests in lands therefor in or near to which the pollution control facilities are or are to be located.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Enter into a lease, lease-purchase agreement, or installment sales contract with any person, firm, corporation, or public utility for the use or sale of pollution control facilities referred to in subdivision (a). The agreement shall provide that the rents to be charged for the use or the sums to be paid under the installment sales contract shall be fixed so as to produce income and revenues therefrom sufficient to pay promptly when due the interest upon and the principal of all bonds issued payable therefrom after provision has been made for the payment of operation and maintenance costs, if the costs of operation and maintenance are required to be paid under the agreement by the municipality. An agreement may provide for conveyance of the pollution control facilities to the lessee or purchaser under the agreement after provision has been made for the retirement in full of all bonds issued therefor under terms and conditions provided in the agreement or, with respect to pollution control facilities leased or sold to a public utility, at any time where the obligation of the lessee or purchaser to make the payments prescribed by the preceding sentence of this subdivision shall remain fixed as therein provided notwithstanding the conveyance. The agreement shall specify that the pollution control facilities shall remain in or near the industrial building or plant or facility of the person, firm, corporation, or public utility until provision has been made for the retirement in full of all bonds issued therefor unless the pollution control facilities are conveyed by the municipality as authorized by this subdivision or are replaced without cost to the municipality with machinery and equipment of at least equivalent value or utility. Where the pollution control facilities are sold pursuant to an installment sales contract, the terms "lease,""leased,""lessee," or words of similar import used in this act shall be construed respectively to mean "installment sales contract,""sold,""purchaser," or words of similar import as the context may require, and the term "rent" or words of similar import as used in this act shall be construed to mean "purchase installments" or words of similar import as the context may require.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Mortgage or create security interest in any pollution control facilities referred to in subdivision (a), or in any lease, lease-purchase agreement, or installment sales contract referred to in subdivision (c), or in the rents, revenues, or sums to be paid thereunder, in favor of the holders of the revenue bonds issued therefor. A mortgage or security interest in pollution control facilities leased or sold to a public utility may be subject, or may be made subject, to a mortgage, lien, security interest, or encumbrance to which the interest of the municipality may be subject to pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (a) or to a future mortgage, lien, security interest, or other encumbrance which may be created in any pollution control facilities by the lessee or purchaser.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Sell and convey the pollution control facilities referred to in subdivision (a) owned by the municipality, including without limitation the sale and conveyance thereof subject to a mortgage or security interest referred to in subdivision (d) for such price and at such time as the governing body may determine. A sale or conveyance shall not be made in any manner as to impair the rights or interests of the holders of any revenue bonds previously issued therefor or the rights or interests of any lessee or the purchaser thereof under any agreement with the municipality for the lease or purchase thereof.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 4.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   For the purpose of defraying the cost of the industrial building, the site for the building, and industrial machinery and equipment, a municipality may borrow money and issue its negotiable bonds for that purpose. The bonds shall be serial bonds or term bonds or a combination of these and if serial bonds they shall be payable either semiannually or annually with the first maturity date not more than 5 years from the date of issuance. The last maturity date of the bonds, whether term or serial, shall be not more than 40 years from the date of issuance. A maturity date shall not fall due after the estimated period of usefulness of the industrial building, or, if the industrial machinery and equipment represent more than 2/3 of the total cost of the project, after the average estimated period of usefulness of said industrial machinery and equipment. The bonds shall bear a rate of interest as specified therein not to exceed the maximum rate permitted by the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821, payable semiannually, except that the first coupon may be for any number of months not exceeding 10. The bonds and coupons shall be substantially in the form provided in the authorizing resolution and shall be executed in the manner prescribed in this act, which as to coupons may be by facsimile signature. The bonds and coupons shall be payable in lawful money of the United States, and shall be exempt from taxation by this state or by any taxing authority within this state. The principal and interest of the bonds shall be payable from the net revenues derived from the industrial building and site and industrial machinery and equipment, from the proceeds of the sale of bonds issued to refund outstanding bonds, from the investment earnings of the proceeds, or from any combination of these sources. A bond or coupon issued pursuant to this act shall not be a general obligation of the issuer nor constitute a debt of the issuer within the meaning of the constitutional or statutory limitation. Bonds may be made registerable as to principal or principal and interest under terms and conditions as may be determined by the governing body of the municipality.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 9.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the governing body finds that the bonds originally authorized will be insufficient to accomplish the purpose desired, additional bonds, only in the amount necessary to complete the project as originally approved, may be authorized and issued in the same manner as the original bonds. Additional bonds may be issued to defray the cost of 1 or more of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   An item of cost contained in section 10.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Interest that has accrued, may accrue, or has been paid during the construction period of the project and for 6 months after the construction period on money borrowed or that is estimated to be borrowed pursuant to this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Interest on previously issued bonds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   At the time of issuing additional bonds, the governing body may provide that the additional bonds for additions, extensions, and permanent improvements, be placed in escrow and negotiated from time to time as the proceeds for those purposes are necessary. When negotiated, bonds placed in escrow shall have equal standing with bonds of the same issue.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The municipality may issue bonds at any time to refund, in whole or in part, outstanding bonds issued pursuant to this act, including the payment of interest accrued, or to accrue, to the earliest or any subsequent date of redemption, purchase, or maturity of the bonds, redemption premium, if any, and any commission, service fees, and other expenses necessary to be paid in connection therewith, whether the bonds to be refunded have matured or are redeemable or shall thereafter mature or become redeemable. If considered advisable by the municipality, the municipality may issue bonds partly to refund outstanding bonds and partly for any other purpose contemplated by this act. Bonds issued to refund outstanding bonds may be issued in a principal amount greater than, the same as, or lesser than the principal amount of the bonds to be refunded, and may bear interest rates that are higher than, the same as, or lower than the interest rates of the bonds to be refunded. The interest rates, however, shall not exceed the maximum rate of interest permitted by the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The principal, interest, and redemption premiums, if any, on bonds issued by a municipality pursuant to this section to refund outstanding bonds shall be payable from 1 or more of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The net revenues derived from the facilities constructed, acquired, reconstructed, remodeled, or repaired with the proceeds of the bonds to be refunded.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The proceeds of the refunding bonds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Investment earnings on the proceeds of the refunding bonds.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The legislature hereby determines that there exists in the state a seriously inadequate supply of, and a pressing need for, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations within the financial means of low income or moderate income families or persons, including those families and persons displaced by the clearing of slums and blighted areas or by other public programs; that there exists in this state a high incidence of residential real property occupied by persons of low and moderate income which is not safe, sanitary, or adequate and that there is a pressing need for rehabilitation of that property; that large areas in municipalities have become blighted or, through programs to remove blight, have become vacant, resulting in the impairment or loss of taxable values upon which municipal revenue largely depends; that large numbers of middle and upper income persons and families have left municipalities which have high concentrations of low income persons and families resulting in a high demand for municipal services notwithstanding a low potential for generating revenues necessary to pay for those services; that the existence of blight, the inability to redevelop cleared areas, and the lack of economic integration is detrimental to the general welfare of the citizens of this state and the economic welfare of municipalities in this state; that the financing of housing for persons and families without regard to income will assist in preserving existing values of property within or adjacent to blighted or cleared areas; that economic integration will promote the financial and social stability of housing for families and persons of low and moderate income; that in order to improve and maintain the general character of municipalities having the aforesaid characteristics, it is necessary to promote the development of housing for persons and families without regard to income; that to increase the availability of safe and sanitary housing generally it is necessary to facilitate the purchase of existing housing by making financing for the purchase of existing housing available at affordable interest rates; that there are inadequate social, recreational, commercial, and communal facilities in residential areas inhabited by low income or moderate income families or persons and in areas blighted or vacant because of slum clearance, and that housing financed pursuant to this act will not be viable without adequate social, recreational, commercial, and communal facilities in the surrounding area; and that it is a valid public purpose to finance the acquisition and rehabilitation of existing housing or the construction of additional housing for those low or moderate income families and persons who would otherwise be unable to obtain adequate and affordable dwellings, to finance the rehabilitation of residential real property occupied or to be occupied by persons and families of low and moderate income who would otherwise be unable to afford the purchase or rehabilitation of residential real property which is safe, sanitary, or adequate, to finance housing for persons and families without regard to income in areas in municipalities which are experiencing blight or inability to redevelop land cleared of blight which are predominately populated by low and moderate income persons and families, to finance social, recreational, commercial, and communal facilities to serve those families or persons, to enhance authority-financed housing, to establish and provide acceleration and foreclosure procedures for authority-financed housing, and to acquire land for present or future development including that housing and social, recreational, commercial, and communal facilities; that it is a valid public purpose to finance safe, sanitary, and adequate mobile homes, mobile home parks, and mobile home condominium projects for persons and families of low and moderate income in order to facilitate the provision of affordable housing for such persons, to finance mobile homes, mobile home parks, and mobile home condominium projects without regard to income in areas in municipalities which are experiencing blight or inability to redevelop land cleared of blight which are predominately populated by low and moderate income persons and families, and to finance social, recreational, commercial, and communal facilities in mobile home parks and mobile home condominium projects, the financing of mobile homes, mobile home parks, and mobile home condominium projects being necessary to fill a gap in the housing market.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) It is further determined that the supply of low and moderate cost housing available for occupancy by certain persons with disabilities and certain elderly persons is being eroded through greatly increasing rental rates, and the conversion of low and moderate cost rental units into condominium units which are then sold at prices and under financing terms which are not affordable to those persons with disabilities and elderly persons. It is further determined that it is a proper public purpose to prevent the erosion of the supply of existing low and moderate cost housing available for occupancy by certain persons with disabilities and elderly persons by taking appropriate action to prevent the displacement of those persons with disabilities and elderly persons from existing low and moderate cost housing, including the making of loans enabling those persons with disabilities and elderly persons to continue to rent the units in which they reside.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) It is further determined that to assure an adequate supply of safe and sanitary housing for families of low and moderate income within the financial means of those families, it is necessary to facilitate the purchase of safe and sanitary existing housing by those families; that, in addition, new single-family housing construction is inhibited by the inability of prospective purchasers to sell existing single-family residences, and that those conditions result in the reduction of the number of safe and sanitary dwellings which would otherwise be made available to persons of low and moderate income; and that the depressed economy and decreased employment in this state are detrimental to the general welfare of the citizens of this state. It is further determined that it is necessary in order to alleviate those conditions and is a valid public purpose to provide for the financing or refinancing, with the assistance of the authority, of the purchase of existing single-family residences for occupancy by low and moderate income families and families without regard to income in areas in municipalities which are experiencing blight or inability to redevelop land cleared of blight and which are predominately populated by low and moderate income persons and families.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) It is further determined that there exists in this state a high incidence of residential rental property which is not safe, sanitary, adequate, or energy efficient, and that there is a pressing need for the rehabilitation of residential rental property in order to preserve and improve the state's existing housing stock. It is further determined that it is necessary in order to alleviate those conditions and is a valid public purpose to provide for the financing, with the assistance of the authority, of the rehabilitation of existing residential rental property without regard to the income of the persons or entities owning the property or of the tenants of the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) It is further determined that there is a statewide pressing need for programs to alleviate and prevent conditions of unemployment in the housing industry, to preserve existing jobs and create new jobs to meet the employment demands of population growth, to promote the development of construction related business enterprises, to revitalize and diversify the Michigan economy in general, and to achieve the goals of economic growth and full employment. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) It is further determined that the construction and rehabilitation of safe and sanitary dwellings are necessary to the creation and retention of jobs in the state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) It is further determined that the retention, promotion, and development of the housing industry require additional means of financing to help existing business enterprises expand more rapidly, to promote the location of additional business enterprises in this state, and to alleviate and prevent conditions of unemployment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) It is further determined that economic conditions and single-family home mortgage market standards, activities, and practices, including forms of predatory and abusive mortgage loan financing, have resulted in an increase in the incidence of mortgage loan default and mortgage foreclosure in the state, and that there is a pressing need for the creation of programs to assist low and moderate income individuals and families with the refinancing of single-family mortgages in this state, which programs will prevent families from losing their homes and help to stabilize the housing market in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The legislature finds that the conditions described in subsections (1) to (8) cannot be remedied by the ordinary operation of private enterprise without supplementary public participation and that the authority and powers conferred by this act constitute a necessary program and serve a valid public purpose.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the following are exempt from all ad valorem property taxes imposed by this state or by any political subdivision, public body, or taxing district in which the project is located:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A housing project owned by a nonprofit housing corporation, consumer housing cooperative, limited dividend housing corporation, mobile home park corporation, or mobile home park association that is financed with a federally-aided or authority-aided mortgage or advance or grant from the authority. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A housing project that is being developed or rehabilitated for workforce housing that is located in a municipality and is subject to a municipal ordinance that is adopted by the governing body of that municipality to approve a housing project for tax exemption under this subdivision. The approval or denial of a tax exemption under this subdivision must be in accordance with an ordinance or resolution concerning the selection of workforce housing projects that is adopted by the governing body.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The owner of a housing project eligible for an exemption under subsection (1) must file with the local assessing officer a notification of the exemption. The notification must be in an affidavit form as provided by the authority. The owner must first submit the completed affidavit form to the authority for certification by the authority that the project is eligible for the exemption. The owner must then file the certified notification of the exemption with the local assessing officer before November 1 of the year preceding the tax year in which the exemption is to begin. If the housing project is eligible for an exemption under subsection (1)(b), not later than 5 business days after receipt of the certified notification of the exemption, the local assessing officer shall provide a copy of the certified notification of the exemption to the treasurer of the county in which the housing project is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The owner of a housing project exempt from taxation under this section shall pay to the municipality in which the project is located an annual service charge for public services in lieu of all taxes. All of the following apply to the amount that an owner must pay as a service charge under this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The owner must pay an annual service charge in accordance with the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Subject to subdivisions (b), (c), (d), and (e), for a new construction project, an amount that is the greater of the tax on the property on which the project is located for the tax year preceding the date on which construction is commenced or 10% of the annual shelter rents obtained from the project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Subject to subdivisions (b), (c), (d), and (e), for a rehabilitation project, an amount that is the lesser of the tax on the property on which the project is located for the tax year preceding the date on which rehabilitation is commenced or 10% of the annual shelter rents obtained from the project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Subject to subdivisions (c), (d), and (e), a municipality, by ordinance, may establish or change, by any amount it chooses, the service charge paid under subdivision (a) in lieu of taxes by all or any class of housing projects exempt from taxation under this act. However, the service charge must not exceed the amount in taxes that an owner would have otherwise paid if the housing project were not tax exempt.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a service charge paid each year in lieu of taxes for that part of a housing project that is tax exempt under subsection (1)(a) and occupied by individuals or families other than low-income individuals or families must be equal to the full amount of the taxes that would be paid on that portion of the housing project if the housing project were not tax exempt. The owner of the housing project must allocate the benefits of any tax exemption granted under this section exclusively to low-income individuals or families or to the maintenance and preservation of the housing project as a safe, decent, and sanitary affordable housing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a service charge paid each year in lieu of taxes for that part of a housing project that is tax exempt under subsection (1)(b) and not used for workforce housing must be equal to the full amount of the taxes that would be paid on that portion of the housing project if the housing project were not tax exempt. The owner of the housing project must allocate the benefits of any tax exemption granted under this section exclusively to workforce housing or to the maintenance and preservation of the housing project as a safe, decent, and sanitary workforce housing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The annual service charge under subdivision (a) for a housing project that is tax exempt under subsection (1)(b) must be increased by the additional amount if both of the following requirements are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Not later than 45 days after the treasurer of the county's receipt of the certified notification of the exemption under subsection (2), the county board of commissioners for that county passes a resolution, by majority vote, that provides that the additional amount must be paid under this subdivision. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The approval of the resolution described in subparagraph (i) is in accordance with an ordinance or resolution adopted by the county board of commissioners concerning the factors to be considered in applying this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The exemption from taxation granted by subsection (1)(a), or approved by a governing body under subsection (1)(b), must remain in effect in accordance with the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For a housing project described under subsection (1)(a), for as long as the federally-aided or authority-aided mortgage or advance or grant from the authority is outstanding, but not more than 50 years. The municipality may establish by ordinance a different period of time for the exemption to remain in effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For a housing project described in subsection (1)(b), if the housing project remains subject to a covenant running with the land that restricts the use of the housing project to workforce housing, not to exceed 15 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and subsection (6), any payments for public services received by a municipality in lieu of taxes under this section must be distributed by the municipality to the several units levying the general property tax in the same proportion as prevailed with the general property tax in the previous calendar year. For payments in lieu of taxes collected after June 30, 1994, the distribution to the several units must be made as if the number of mills levied for local school district operating purposes were equal to the number of mills levied for those purposes in 1993 minus the number of mills levied under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, for the year for which the distribution is calculated. For tax years after 1993, the amount of payments in lieu of taxes to be distributed to a local school district for operating purposes under this subsection must not be distributed to the local school district but instead must be paid to the state treasury and credited to the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An additional amount received under subsection (3)(e) must be distributed to the county in which the housing project is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Notwithstanding subsection (1)(a), a municipality may provide by ordinance that the tax exemption established in subsection (1) does not apply to all or any class of housing projects within its boundaries to which subsection (1)(a) applies. If the municipality makes that provision, the tax exemption established in subsection (1)(a) does not apply to the class of housing projects designated in the ordinance. If the ordinance so provides, the ordinance is effective with respect to housing projects for which an exemption has already been granted on December 31 of the year in which the ordinance is adopted, but not before. A municipality that has adopted an ordinance described in this subsection may repeal that ordinance, and the repeal is effective on the date designated in the repealing ordinance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) For purposes of this section only, "low-income individuals or families" means, with respect to any housing project that is tax exempt, individuals and families eligible to move into that project, as defined by the authority under its rules or a municipality by ordinance. For purposes of this subsection, the authority may promulgate rules to redefine low-income individuals or families or a municipality may by ordinance redefine low-income individuals or families for each municipality on the basis of conditions existing in that municipality.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) This state shall not reimburse any unit of government for a tax exemption granted to any housing project under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Additional amount" means an amount equal to the difference between the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The millage rate levied for operating purposes by the county in which the housing project is located multiplied by the current taxable value of that housing project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The amount of the annual service charge paid by the housing project under subsection (3)(a) that is distributed to the county in which the housing project is located under subsection (5).</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 21.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   There is created a public body corporate and politic to be known as the "Michigan state housing development authority". The authority shall consist of 3 heads of principal departments of the executive branch of the state government and 4 persons appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate. Excluding the 3 heads of principal departments of the executive branch of state government and the designated resident member described in subsection (2), not more than 2 of the persons appointed shall be members of the same political party. Upon completion of each term, a person shall be appointed for a term of 4 years, except that a vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term. A member of the authority shall not receive compensation for services but is entitled to the necessary expenses, including traveling expenses, incurred in the discharge of the member's duties. Each member shall hold office until a successor has been appointed and has qualified. A certificate of appointment or reappointment of a member shall be filed with the authority and this certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the proper appointment of that member.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If federal law requires designation of a resident member on the authority, the number of gubernatorially appointed members, in addition to the 3 heads of principal departments, increases from 4 to 5. One of the 5 gubernatorially appointed members shall be the designated resident member. The resident member shall meet both of the following requirements:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The person is an individual directly assisted by a federal housing program administered through the authority. As used in this subdivision, "directly assisted" means residing in federally-supported public housing or receiving section 8 tenant-based assistance. Directly assisted does not include a state-financed housing assistance program, section 8 project-based assistance, or section 8 new construction assistance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The person is an eligible resident. As used in this subdivision, "eligible resident" means a person whose name appears on the lease of the assisted housing who is 18 years of age or older.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A person who no longer meets either requirement of subsection (2)(a) or (b) is removed from the authority for cause upon the appointment of another person as the resident member position.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The powers of the authority shall be vested in the members in office. A majority of the members of the authority constitutes a quorum for the purpose of conducting the authority's business, for exercising the authority's powers, and for other purposes, notwithstanding the existence of any vacancies. Action may be taken by the authority upon a vote of a majority of the members present, unless the bylaws of the authority require a larger number, except that to the extent required by federal law, the resident member shall only take part in, vote on, and exercise the powers of the authority concerning decisions related to the administration, operation, and management of federal public housing programs and section 8 tenant-based assistance programs. The resident member shall not take part in, vote on, or exercise the powers of the authority in a matter that uniquely applies to the resident member and is not generally applicable to all residents. In the absence of fraud, a determination of the authority with respect to findings of fact made by the authority acting within the scope of its powers is conclusive, except with respect to the approval of the municipal finance commission or its successor agency as required by law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Meetings of the members of the authority may be held anywhere in this state. The business that the authority may perform shall be conducted at a public meeting of the authority held in compliance with the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275. Public notice of the time, date, and place of the meeting shall be given in the manner required by the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The authority shall elect a chairperson and vice-chairperson. The authority shall employ an executive director, legal and technical experts, and other officers, agents, and employees, permanent and temporary, as the authority requires, and shall determine their qualifications, duties, and compensation. The authority may delegate to 1 or more agents or employees those powers or duties as the authority considers proper.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The authority shall be within the department of consumer and industry services and shall exercise the authority's prescribed statutory powers, duties, and functions independently of the head of that department. However, the budgeting, procurement, and related functions of the authority shall be performed under the direction and supervision of the director of consumer and industry services.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   As used in this section, "section 8" means section 8 of the United States housing act of 1937, chapter 896, 88 Stat. 662, 42 U.S.C. 1437f.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(p) To enter into agreements with nonprofit housing corporations, consumer housing cooperatives, limited dividend housing corporations, mobile home park corporations, and mobile home park associations that provide for regulation by the authority of the planning, development, and management of any housing project undertaken by nonprofit housing corporations, consumer housing cooperatives, limited dividend housing corporations, mobile home park corporations, and mobile home park associations and that provide for the disposition of the property and franchises of those corporations, cooperatives, and associations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(q) To appoint to the board of directors of a nonprofit housing corporation, consumer housing cooperative, limited dividend housing corporation, mobile home park corporation, or mobile home park association, a number of new directors sufficient to constitute a majority of the board notwithstanding other provisions of the articles of incorporation or other provisions of law. Directors appointed under this subsection need not be stockholders or members or meet other qualifications that may be described by the certificate of incorporation or bylaws. In the absence of fraud or bad faith, directors appointed under this subsection shall not be personally liable for debts, obligations, or liabilities of the corporation or association. The authority may appoint directors under this subsection only if 1 or more of the following occur:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The nonprofit housing corporation, consumer housing cooperative, limited dividend housing corporation, mobile home park corporation, or mobile home park association has received a loan or advance, as provided for in this act, and the authority determines that the loan or advance is in jeopardy of not being repaid.</div>

However, this subparagraph shall apply to individual cooperators in consumer housing cooperatives only in circumstances defined by the authority in its rules.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) The authority determines that the nonprofit housing corporation, consumer housing cooperative, limited dividend housing corporation, mobile home park corporation, or mobile home park association is in violation of the rules promulgated under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) The authority determines that the nonprofit housing corporation, consumer housing cooperative, limited dividend housing corporation, mobile home park corporation, or mobile home park association is in violation of 1 or more agreements entered into with the authority that provide for regulation by the authority of the planning, development, and management of a housing project undertaken by the nonprofit housing corporation, consumer housing cooperative, limited dividend housing corporation, mobile home park corporation, or mobile home park association or that provide for the disposition of the property and franchises of the corporation, cooperative, or association.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(u) To review and approve rental charges for authority-financed housing projects and require whatever changes the authority determines to be necessary. The changes shall become effective after not less than 30 days' written notice is given to the residents of the affected authority-financed housing projects.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) To set forth in the various loan documents of the authority those restrictions on the sale, conveyance by land contract, or transfer of residential real property, housing projects, or housing units for which a note is held by the authority and restrictions on the assumption by subsequent purchasers of loans originated by and held by, or originated for purchase by and held by, the authority as the authority determines to be necessary in order to comply with requirements of federal statutes, federal rules or regulations promulgated under 5 USC 551 to 559, state statutes, or state rules promulgated under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, or to obtain and maintain the tax exempt status of authority bonds and notes. However, the authority shall not use a due on sale or acceleration clause solely for the purpose of renegotiating the interest rate on a loan made with respect to an owner-occupied single-family housing unit. Without limiting the authority's power to establish other restrictions, as provided in this section, on the sale, conveyance by land contract, or transfer of residential real property, housing projects, or housing units for which a note is held by the authority and the assumption by subsequent purchasers of loans made or purchased by the authority, the authority shall provide in its loan documents relating to a single family loan that the single family loan may be assumed by a new purchaser only when the new purchaser qualifies under the authority income limitations rules, unless such a restriction diminishes or precludes the insurance or a guarantee by an agency of the federal government with respect to the single family loan. A loan made for a mobile home that the borrower does not intend to permanently affix to real property shall become immediately due and payable if the mobile home is moved out of the state. Any restrictions on conveyance by sale, conveyance by land contract, or transfer that are authorized in this section shall apply only to loans originated by and held by, or originated for purchase by and held by, the authority and may, at the option of the authority, be enforced by accelerating and declaring immediately due and payable all sums evidenced by the note held by the authority. An acceleration and declaration of all sums to be due and payable on conveyance by sale, land contract, or transfer is not an unreasonable restraint on alienation. An acceleration and declaration, unless otherwise prohibited in this subdivision, of all sums to be due and payable under this subdivision is enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. This subdivision is applicable to secured and unsecured loans. This subdivision is also applicable to loan documents utilized in conjunction with an authority-operated program of residential rehabilitation by an entity cooperating or participating with the authority under section 22a(4), if the loans are originated with the intent to sell those loans to the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(w) To set forth in the various loan documents of the authority remedies for the making of a false statement, representation, or pretense or a material misstatement by a borrower during the loan application process. Without limiting the authority's power to pursue other remedies, the authority shall provide in its loan documents that, if a borrower makes a false statement, representation, or pretense or a material misstatement during the loan application process, the authority, at its option, may accelerate and declare immediately due and payable all sums evidenced by the note held by the authority. An acceleration and declaration of all sums to be due and payable as provided in this subdivision is enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. This subdivision is applicable to secured and unsecured loans.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(x) To collect interest on a real estate loan, the primary security for which is not a first lien on real estate, at the rate of 15% or less per annum on the unpaid balance. This subdivision does not impair the validity of a transaction or rate of interest that is lawful without regard to this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(y) To encourage and engage or participate in programs to accomplish the preservation of housing in this state available for occupancy by persons and families of low or moderate income.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(z) To verify for the state treasurer statements submitted by a city, village, township, or county as to exempt properties under section 7d of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7d.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(aa) For the purpose of more effectively managing its debt service, to enter into an interest rate exchange or swap, hedge, or similar agreement with respect to its bonds or notes on the terms and payable from the sources and with the security, if any, as determined by a resolution of the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(bb) To make working capital loans to contractors or subcontractors on housing projects financed by the authority. The authority shall submit an annual report to the legislature containing the amount, recipient, duration, circumstance, and other related statistics for each capital loan made to a contractor or subcontractor under this subdivision. The authority shall include in the report statistics related to the cost of improvements made to adapt property for use by disabled individuals as provided in section 32b or 44.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(cc) Subject to rules of the civil service commission, to adopt a code of ethics with respect to its employees that requires disclosure of financial interests, defines and precludes conflicts of interest, and establishes reasonable post-employment restrictions for a period of up to 1 year after an employee terminates employment with the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(dd) To impose covenants running with the land in order to satisfy requirements of applicable federal law with respect to housing assisted or to be assisted through federal programs such as the low income housing tax credit program or the home investment partnerships program. These covenants shall be imposed by executing and recording regulatory agreements between the authority, or a municipality or other entity designated by the authority, and the person or entity to be bound. The covenants shall run with the land and be effective with respect to the parties making the covenants and other intended beneficiaries of the covenants, even though there is no privity of estate or privity of contract between the authority and the persons or entities to be bound.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ee) To impose covenants running with the land in order to satisfy requirements of applicable state or federal law with respect to housing financed by the authority. These covenants shall be imposed by executing and recording regulatory agreements between the authority and the person or entity to be bound. The covenants shall run with the land and be effective with respect to the parties making the covenants and other intended beneficiaries of the covenants, even though there is no privity of estate or privity of contract between the authority and the persons or entities to be bound. With respect to any applicable environmental laws, this subdivision does not grant to the authority any additional rights, privileges, or immunities not otherwise afforded to a private lender that is not in the chain of title for the land.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ff) To participate in programs designed to assist persons and families whose incomes do not exceed 115% of the greater of statewide median gross income or the area median gross income become homeowners where loans are made by private lenders for purchase by the government national mortgage association, federal national mortgage association, federal home loan mortgage corporation, or other federally chartered organizations. Participation may include providing or funding homeownership counseling and providing some or all of a reserve fund to be used to pay for losses in excess of insurance coverage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(gg) To invest, under the conditions prescribed in this subdivision and without the consent of the escrow depositors, up to 20% of funds held, by or for the authority, in escrow accounts for the benefit of the authority or mortgagors of authority-financed housing. The investments under this subdivision shall be made in loans originated or purchased by the authority for construction or rehabilitation of multifamily housing developments for occupancy by persons or families without regard to income. In connection with loans described in this subdivision, the authority may charge and retain fees in amounts similar to those charged with respect to similar loans for which the source of funding does not come from escrow accounts. For purposes of this subdivision, "escrow account" means any account or reserve held by the authority and established in a mortgage or a regulatory agreement to which the authority is a party or which has been assigned to the authority. However, for purposes of this subdivision, escrow account does not include any account labeled in the associated regulatory agreement as "development cost escrow principal" or "operating assurance reserve". For purposes of this subdivision, "multifamily housing development" means a development in which not less than 50% of the floor space is used primarily for residential purposes. The investment authorized by this subdivision shall not be made unless both of the following requirements are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The return on the loan is approximately equivalent to that which could be obtained from investments of substantially similar credit quality and maturity, as determined by the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The authority agrees to pay with its own funds the principal balance of any loan, made with the escrow funds, that becomes delinquent in excess of 30 days. This subdivision does not obligate the authority to purchase a delinquent loan so long as with respect to that loan the authority pays to the escrow funds from its own funds the amount of the delinquent payments. The authority's election to pay the delinquent payments to the escrow funds does not in any manner abate or cure the delinquency of the loan and the authority may resort to any remedies that would exist in the absence of that payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(hh) To acquire, develop, rehabilitate, own, operate, and enter into contracts with respect to the management and operation of real and personal property to use as office facilities by the authority and to enter into leases with respect to facilities not immediately necessary for the activities of the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) To make loans to certain qualified buyers and resident organizations and to make grants to resident organizations as provided in the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The urban homestead act, 1999 PA 127, MCL 125.2701 to 125.2709.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The urban homesteading on vacant land act, 1999 PA 129, MCL 125.2741 to 125.2748.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 22b.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The authority is designated as the housing credit agency for the state for the purpose of allocating and administering the low income housing credit established under section 42 of the internal revenue code of 1986.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The state's housing credit ceiling applicable for a calendar year shall be an amount equal to the sum of all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   One dollar and twenty-five cents multiplied by the state's population, unless a different amount is authorized by section 42 of the internal revenue code of 1986. The state's population shall be determined by the most recent census estimates of the state's population published by the United States bureau of census before the beginning of the calendar year or by another method as authorized by the internal revenue code of 1986.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The unused state housing credit ceiling, if any, of the state for the preceding calendar year, for years subsequent to 1989.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The amount of state housing credit ceiling returned in the calendar year, for years subsequent to 1989.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The amount, if any, allocated to the state under section 42(h)(3)(D) of the internal revenue code of 1986.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   An applicant for an allocation of low income housing tax credit shall be qualified to receive the credit pursuant to the requirements of the internal revenue code of 1986 and the regulations, guidelines, rulings, and interpretations issued by the United States treasury department or the internal revenue service, that controls in the event of conflict with a requirement of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The state's low income housing tax credit is allocable pursuant to a qualified allocation plan prepared by the authority, submitted to the legislature, and approved by the governor after notice to the public and public hearing. The plan shall set forth criteria to be used to determine housing priorities of the state, and shall give the highest priority to those projects in which the highest percentage of the housing credit dollar amount is to be used for project costs other than the cost of intermediaries, unless granting such priority would impede the development of projects in hard-to-develop areas. In allocating low income housing tax credit dollar amounts among selected projects, the allocation plan shall give preference to projects serving the lowest income tenants and projects obligated to serve qualified tenants for the longest periods, and shall provide a procedure that the authority will follow in notifying the internal revenue service of noncompliance with the provisions of section 42 of the internal revenue code of 1986 of which the authority becomes aware. The plan shall set forth the process for selecting eligible projects and may be amended from time to time in accordance with its terms and the requirements of section 42 of the internal revenue code of 1986. The selection criteria in the qualified allocation plan shall include those set forth in section 42 of the internal revenue code of 1986.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The state's low income housing tax credit authority shall be distributed in accordance with the qualified allocation plan. Amounts allocable under subsection (2) shall be set aside as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Qualified nonprofit organizations as required by section 42 of the internal revenue code of 1986 - not less than 10%.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Rural housing projects - not less than 5%.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Housing projects in eligible distressed areas - not less than 30%.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Housing projects for the elderly - not less than 10%. Projects counted in 1 category shall not count in another category towards meeting the minimum set-aside requirements.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Except for the amount for qualified nonprofit organizations, if the low income housing tax credit set aside under subsection (5) is not allocated before October 1 of the year in which that credit amount is authorized under subsection (2)(a), the authority may reapportion the unallocated credit amounts in a reasonable manner pursuant to the state's qualified allocation plan.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   All applications for low income housing tax credit shall be on the authority's prescribed forms and shall include information necessary pursuant to the qualified allocation plan and section 42 of the internal revenue code of 1986.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The authority may charge applicants reasonable fees under the low income housing tax credit program.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   For the purposes of this section, "rural housing projects" means proposed or existing housing projects that fall into 1 or more of the following categories:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Located in an area other than a metropolitan county.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Funded by a federal program for the development of rural housing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Financed by a loan guaranteed by rural housing services or a successor agency.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The authority may use the money held in the land acquisition and development fund to lease, acquire, or contract to acquire real property by grant, purchase, or otherwise from any person, firm, partnership, corporation, municipality, county, or federal or state agency, upon determining that the real property may be suitable for a future housing development or housing project; or is located in a residential area where the authority has financed or has planned to finance housing and the proposed use of the real property will improve the quality of the residential area by eliminating blight or provide needed public or commercial facilities; or is so situated that the present or future use of the real property, if not acquired by the authority, will adversely affect the value or marketability of the authority financed housing project. The authority may acquire real property in its own name or through and in the name of an agent by means of land contract, option, or other form of deferred payment agreement, or subject to mortgages or other encumbrances, if the authority reserves money in this fund or authorization to issue notes and bonds, the aggregate amount of which equals the unpaid principal balance on the land contracts, options, mortgages, or other encumbrances or deferred payment agreements plus any anticipated carrying charges, including insurance premiums, interest, maintenance expenses, and property taxes.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The authority may create and establish 1 or more special funds called capital reserve funds to secure notes and bonds of the authority. The authority shall pay into a capital reserve fund money appropriated and made available by this state for the purposes of the fund, the proceeds of the sale of notes or bonds to the extent provided in the resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of the notes or bonds, and other money that is made available to the authority for the purpose of a fund from any other source. In addition to, or in lieu of, depositing money in a capital reserve fund, the authority may obtain and pledge letters of credit and, effective retroactively as of June 1, 1993, insurance policies, surety bonds, guarantees, or other security arrangements if those other security arrangements are approved by the state treasurer, for the purposes of the capital reserve fund. The amount available under letters of credit, insurance policies, surety bonds, guarantees, or other security arrangements pledged to a capital reserve fund must be credited toward the satisfaction of a capital reserve fund requirement. All money and proceeds under letters of credit, insurance policies, surety bonds, guarantees, or other security arrangements held in a capital reserve fund, except as specifically provided, must be used as required solely for the payment of the principal of notes or bonds of the authority secured in whole or in part by the capital reserve fund, for the purchase or redemption of notes or bonds, for the payment of interest on the notes or bonds, or for the payment of a redemption premium required to be paid when the notes or bonds are redeemed prior to maturity. However, the authority shall not use the capital reserve fund for an optional purchase or optional redemption of notes or bonds if the use would reduce the total of the money on deposit in the capital reserve fund and amounts available under a letter of credit, insurance policy, surety bond, guarantee, or other security arrangement pledged to a capital reserve fund to less than the capital reserve fund requirement established for the fund. Income or interest earned by, or increment to, a capital reserve fund from the investment of the money in the capital reserve fund may be transferred by the authority to other funds or accounts of the authority to the extent that the transfer does not reduce the total of the amount of money in a capital reserve fund and amounts available under a letter of credit, insurance policy, surety bond, guarantee, or other security arrangement pledged to the capital reserve fund below the capital reserve fund requirement for the fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The authority shall not issue notes or bonds secured in whole or in part by a capital reserve fund if, upon the issuance of the notes or bonds, the amount in the capital reserve fund, including the amounts available under a letter of credit, insurance policy, surety bond, guarantee, or other security arrangement pledged to the capital reserve fund, would be less than the capital reserve fund requirement for the fund, unless the authority, at the time of issuance of the notes or bonds, deposits in the fund from the proceeds of the notes or bonds to be issued, or from other sources, an amount that, together with the amount then in the fund, is not less than the capital reserve fund requirement for the fund, or obtains a letter of credit, insurance policy, surety bond, guarantee, or other security arrangement in an amount that, together with the amount then in the fund, is not less than the capital reserve fund requirement for the fund. For the purposes of this section, "capital reserve fund requirement" means the amount required in the resolution of the authority authorizing the notes or bonds with respect to which the fund is established, which amount must not exceed the maximum amount of principal and interest maturing and becoming due in a succeeding calendar year on the notes or bonds of the authority secured in whole or part by the fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The authority has, before January 9, 1977, in connection with its housing development bonds issued pursuant to a bond resolution dated June 10, 1971, established within the capital reserve fund relating to housing development bonds, a capital reserve account and a capital reserve capital account. This capital reserve account constitutes a capital reserve fund under this act. Money in this capital reserve account must secure only housing development bonds issued pursuant to the June 10, 1971 bond resolution. Unless otherwise provided by the authority, money in the capital reserve capital account must secure all bonds and notes of the authority. In determining whether the capital reserve fund requirement established for a capital reserve fund has been met, the authority shall not include or take into account money in the capital reserve capital account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The authority has, before January 9, 1977, in connection with its insured mortgage revenue bonds issued pursuant to a bond resolution dated May 11, 1976, established a bond reserve fund. This bond reserve fund constitutes a capital reserve fund under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The authority shall not have outstanding at any time bonds and notes for any of its corporate purposes in an aggregate principal amount exceeding $10,000,000,000.00, excluding all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The principal amount of bonds and notes issued to refund outstanding bonds and notes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The principal amount of bonds and notes that appreciate in principal amount, except to the extent of the principal amount of these bonds and notes payable at such time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The principal amount of notes and bonds representing original issue discount, if any.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Subject to the limitation in subsection (5), that portion of the state ceiling to be used for qualified mortgage bonds, mortgage credit certificates, or bonds to finance qualified residential rental projects must be allocated to the authority unless the authority elects by resolution to allow another issuer to issue qualified mortgage bonds, mortgage credit certificates, or bonds to finance qualified residential rental projects. As used in this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Mortgage credit certificate" means that term as defined in section 25 of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 25.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Qualified mortgage bond" means that term as defined in section 143 of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 143.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Qualified residential rental project" means that term as defined in section 142 of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 142.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "State ceiling" means the aggregate amount of certain private activity bonds, including qualified mortgage bonds, that may be issued in any calendar year in this state pursuant to section 146 of the internal revenue code of 1986, 26 USC 146.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) To ensure the continued operation and solvency of the authority for the carrying out of the public purposes of this act, the authority shall accumulate in each capital reserve fund an amount equal to the capital reserve fund requirement for that fund.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>With respect to bonds, other than refunding bonds, issued to finance single family homes after November 1, 1989, for the first 60 days following the announcement of a program funded by the proceeds of those bonds, 50% of the proceeds of those bonds available to make loans, as determined by the preliminary information obtained by originating lenders at the time a reservation is submitted, shall be reserved for applicants with gross annual incomes at or below 60% of the statewide median gross income. The authority may, by resolution, waive this requirement. The authority shall advise the house of representatives and senate standing committees with jurisdiction over housing issues 5 days prior to adopting a resolution waiving this requirement. With respect to bonds, other than refunding bonds, issued to finance single family homes after November 1, 1989, not more than 50% of the proceeds of those bonds may be used to finance single family homes for homebuyers who previously have had an ownership interest in a residence.

The enactment of this subparagraph or the expiration of the authority granted by it does not affect rules in effect before July 10, 1984, or promulgated after July 9, 1984, to define low or moderate income persons.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) For the period of time beginning May 1, 1984, and ending November 1, 1987, housing projects in eligible distressed areas in which housing projects not less than 20% of the dwelling units are allotted to individuals of low or moderate income within the meaning of former section 103(b)(4)(A) of the internal revenue code of 1954, not less than 60% of the dwelling units are available to persons and families whose gross household income does not exceed 150% of the higher of either the median income for a family in this state or the median income for a family within the nonmetropolitan county or metropolitan statistical area in which the housing project is located, as determined by the authority, and not more than 20% of the dwelling units are available for occupancy without regard to income.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The owner of the housing project exercised reasonable efforts to rent the dwelling units to persons and families whose incomes did not exceed the income limitations originally applicable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) For an annual period after the first tenant has occupied the housing project, the owner of the housing project has been unable to attain and sustain at least a 95% occupancy level at the housing project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A loan under this subsection shall not exceed 90% of the project cost as approved by the authority.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Notwithstanding the expiration of lending authority under subsection (1)(a)(ii), (iii), (iv), or (v), multifamily housing projects financed under those subparagraphs may continue to remain eligible for occupancy by persons and families whose incomes do not exceed the limits provided in those subparagraphs or subsection (1)(b).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If a purchase price limit prescribed by this subsection exceeds an applicable limit prescribed by the internal revenue code, the internal revenue code limit applies if the loan will be financed with the proceeds of a tax-exempt bond.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Before the authority makes a loan under this section, authority staff shall determine that the borrower has the ability to repay the loan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) A loan made or purchased to finance the acquisition of an existing housing unit may include funds for rehabilitation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) If the loan is for refinancing a 1- to 4-unit housing unit, including a residential condominium unit as condominium unit is defined in section 4 of the condominium act, 1978 PA 59, MCL 559.104, the authority shall determine that 1 of the units is occupied by the borrower.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The authority may make and contract to make loans to mortgage lenders, and may purchase and enter into commitments for the purchase of securities, certificates of deposit, time deposits, or mortgage loans from mortgage lenders, on terms and conditions it determines are reasonably related to protecting the security of the authority's investment and to implementing the purposes of financing housing projects. Mortgage lenders are authorized to borrow from the authority pursuant to this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The authority shall require as a condition of a loan to a mortgage lender that, within a reasonable period after receipt of the loan proceeds as the authority determines, the mortgage lender enter into written commitments to make new mortgage or secured loans and, within a reasonable period after entering into those commitments as the authority determines, disburse the loan proceeds in new mortgage or secured loans to borrowers eligible under this act in an aggregate principal amount of not less than the amount of the loan to the mortgage lender.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   To assure compliance with this section, the authority, through its members, employees, or agents, may inspect the books and records of a mortgage lender. As a condition of a loan to a mortgage lender, the authority may require agreement by the mortgage lender to the payment of penalties to the authority for violation by the mortgage lender of its agreement with the authority.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The authority shall require that a mortgage lender receiving a loan pursuant to this section shall issue and deliver to the authority evidence of its indebtedness to the authority which evidence shall constitute a general obligation of the mortgage lender and shall bear a date, mature at a time, be subject to prepayment, and contain other provisions consistent with this section and related to protecting the security of the authority's investment, as the authority determines.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The authority may require that the interest rate and other terms of loans to mortgage lenders made from the proceeds of an issue of bonds or notes of the authority shall be at least sufficient to assure the payment of the bonds or notes and the interest on them as they become due. In addition, the authority may require that loans to mortgage lenders are additionally secured as to payment of both principal and interest by a pledge of and lien upon collateral security by special escrow funds or other forms of guarantees and in amounts and forms as the authority determines by resolution to be necessary to assure the payment of the loans and the interest as they become due.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The authority may establish additional requirements it considers necessary with respect to the pledging, assigning, setting aside, or holding of collateral; the making of substitutions for or additions to the collateral; and the disposition of income and receipts from the collateral.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The authority may require as a condition of a loan to a mortgage lender any representations and warranties it determines are necessary to secure the loans and carry out the purposes of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The authority may make loans to mortgage lenders under this section to finance loans for the construction of housing projects or rehabilitation of existing structures for housing projects and for social, recreational, commercial, or communal facilities necessary to serve and improve the residential area in which a housing project is located or is planned to be located thereby enhancing the viability of such housing project.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   The authority shall require that any housing project assisted under this section comply with the income limitations established under section 44, 44a, or 44c together with any additional income limitations required to maintain the tax exemption of notes or bonds issued to provide the financing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   The authority may require additional conditions regarding the planning, development, and management of projects to be financed by the mortgage lender from the proceeds of the authority notes or bonds and may provide for the disposition of the property and franchises of the borrower.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   The authority shall submit a report to the governor and the legislature on its progress in implementing loans to mortgage lenders pursuant to section 44b at 6-month intervals from the effective date of this subsection. </DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the resolution authorizing the issuance of notes or bonds provides that the notes or bonds are limited and not general obligations of the authority, are not secured by the capital reserve capital account, and are secured solely by revenues and property derived from or obtained in connection with the housing project, the authority shall use the proceeds of those notes or bonds to make loans directly, or indirectly by a loan through a mortgage lender, to a nonprofit housing corporation, consumer housing cooperative, limited dividend housing corporation, limited dividend housing association, mobile home park corporation, mobile home park association, or public body or agency for the construction, rehabilitation, long-term financing or any combination of construction, rehabilitation, or long-term financing of any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Multifamily housing projects for students or low income or moderate income persons.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Beginning May 1, 1984, multifamily housing projects in which not less than 20% of the dwelling units are allotted to individuals of low or moderate income within the meaning of former section 103(b)(4)(A) of the internal revenue code of 1954 and in which not more than 80% of the dwelling units are available for occupancy without regard to income.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Social, recreational, commercial, or communal facilities to serve and improve the residential area in which an authority-financed multifamily housing project is located or is planned to be located, thereby enhancing the viability of such housing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) To qualify as rehabilitation under this section, the rehabilitation expenditures with respect to the project must equal or exceed 30% of the portion of the cost of acquiring the building and equipment financed with the proceeds of the notes or bonds issued to acquire and rehabilitate the project. For a project located in an eligible distressed area, the amount of rehabilitation may be less than the 30% requirement if the authority determines by resolution that the likely benefit to the community or the proposed residents of the project merits the use of this financing source. This subsection does not apply to a project for which the authority has authorized a loan commitment under this section before December 18, 1985. The authority shall not provide long-term financing for a project under this section unless the project is constructed or rehabilitated in anticipation of authority financing, the construction or rehabilitation is undertaken with authority financing, long-term financing is being provided with respect to a housing project for which regulatory or contractual restrictions assuring occupancy of some or all of the units by families or persons of low or moderate income are subject to termination within a 2-year period following the acquisition of the housing project, or a housing project which is to be owned and operated by a nonprofit housing corporation which is qualified under section 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 501(c)(3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the authority shall establish by resolution higher income limits for a housing project financed under either subsection (1)(a) or (b) if the authority determines all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The owner of the housing project exercised reasonable efforts to rent the dwelling units to persons and families whose incomes did not exceed the originally applicable income limitations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For any annual period after the first tenant has occupied the housing project, the owner of the housing project has been unable to attain and sustain at least a 95% occupancy level at the housing project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Notwithstanding the expiration of lending authority under this section, multifamily housing projects financed under this section may continue to remain eligible for occupancy by persons and families whose incomes do not exceed the limits provided in subsection (1) or (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A borrower seeking to qualify for a loan under this section shall file an application with the authority which includes the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A description of the proposed credit enhancement. The proposed credit enhancement may be in the form of a letter of credit, bonding, guarantee, mortgage insurance, or other appropriate security in an amount sufficient to assure the authority that repayment of notes or bonds issued by the authority is reasonably secure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An undertaking to pay all costs of issuing the notes or bonds and to provide compensation for, as considered appropriate by the borrower and at no cost to the authority, any underwriters, trustees, counsel, and other professionals as are necessary to complete the financing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An application fee equal to the greater of $4,000.00 or 0.0005 multiplied by the principal amount of notes or bonds for which issuance is requested. For a project located in an eligible distressed area, the fee required by this subdivision is refundable if the notes or bonds are not delivered or may be waived by the authority if the owner of the housing project is or will be a nonprofit housing corporation qualified under section 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 501(c)(3), or a limited dividend housing association wholly owned and controlled by 1 or more nonprofit corporations qualified under section 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 501(c)(3). In all other cases, the fee is nonrefundable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) So long as there is uncommitted bonding capability under the limitations of section 32, the authority shall issue a 6-month commitment to loan funds, subject to sale by the authority of its notes and bonds in compliance with applicable law and pursuant to terms and conditions which permit the funding of such loan, either directly or indirectly by a loan through a mortgage lender, to the borrower in the amount of the total development cost of the proposed multifamily housing project or $25,000,000.00, whichever is less, or if the proposed multifamily housing project is located in an eligible distressed area, in the amount of the total development cost of the proposed project or $50,000,000.00, whichever is less, upon the determination by the authority of all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The housing project is eligible for financing under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The borrower is an eligible borrower under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The requirements of subsection (5) have been met.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The borrower has provided evidence of a commitment to issue a credit enhancement in the form of a letter of credit, bonding, guarantee, mortgage insurance, or other appropriate security in a form and amount sufficient to assure the authority that the repayment of notes or bonds issued by the authority for purposes of making a loan to the borrower is reasonably secure. If the authority determines that repayment of the notes or bonds will be reasonably secure, the authority's review of the credit enhancement shall take the place of the authority's normal underwriting and feasibility review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the loan is made indirectly by a loan through a mortgage lender, the requirements of section 44b have been met.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Unless a borrower is either a nonprofit housing corporation qualified under section 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 501(c)(3), or a limited dividend housing association that is wholly owned and controlled by 1 or more nonprofit corporations qualified under section 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 501(c)(3), and may borrow money from the authority without an allocation of the state volume limitation, a borrower and any person who is a related person to the borrower as defined in section 144(a)(3) of the internal revenue code, 26 USC 144(a)(3), shall not have outstanding loan commitments under this section which total more than the greater of $25,000,000.00 or the amount of financing approved for a single project under subsection (6). Once a loan has been made under this section, the commitment made with respect to the loan shall no longer be considered to be outstanding.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Simultaneously with the issuance of the loan commitment by the authority, the borrower shall pay a commitment fee established by the authority in the amount of not more than 0.1% of the principal amount of notes or bonds to be issued. The authority shall credit the amount paid by the borrower as an application fee under subsection (5) against this commitment fee. The authority shall extend a 6-month loan commitment issued under subsection (6) for an additional 6 months upon payment by the borrower of a nonrefundable extension fee of $5,000.00, which fee shall not be credited against any other fee or payment to the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Within the period during which the commitment is effective, the authority, upon a determination that the terms and conditions of the commitment have been satisfied, shall make its loan directly, or indirectly through a loan to a mortgage lender, to the borrower.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, upon issuance of any notes or bonds to finance a housing project under this section, the borrower shall pay when the notes or bonds are issued, in addition to any commitment or extension fee paid under subsection (8), a fee established by the authority of either not more than 0.9% of the principal amount of the notes or bonds for a loan made for a project located in an eligible distressed area or not more than 1.9% of the principal amount of the notes or bonds for a loan made for a project located in other than an eligible distressed area. If notes or bonds have been issued under this section for a project owned by the borrower located in an eligible distressed area within 180 days before the issuance of notes or bonds for the next project financed by that borrower, which next project is located in other than an eligible distressed area, the fee under this subsection shall be not more than 0.9% of the principal amount of the notes or bonds. If notes or bonds have been issued under this section for a project located in other than an eligible distressed area and the borrower has paid the 1.9% fee, the authority shall not charge a fee under this subsection for the next project financed by that borrower if that next project is located in an eligible distressed area and if the notes or bonds are issued within 180 days after the notes or bonds were issued for the project located in other than an eligible distressed area. In addition to the fee to be paid to the authority when notes or bonds are issued under this section, the authority may, at its sole discretion, establish an annual fee, or other administrative fees, to be paid by the borrower during the term of the loan. All or any portion of the fees due to the authority under this subsection shall be paid by the borrower to the authority in annual or semiannual installments, as the authority shall determine, after the date on which notes or bonds are issued to finance the related housing project. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Subject to any rights of the holders of any notes or bonds issued to finance a multifamily housing project under this section, if the owner of a multifamily housing project financed under this section provides evidence satisfactory to the authority that a prospective new owner of the multifamily housing project is an eligible borrower under this act and the exemption from federal income taxation of interest on the notes or bonds issued to finance the multifamily housing project will not be impaired as a result of a sale, refinancing, or resyndication, the borrower may sell, refinance from a source other than the authority, or resyndicate that housing project at any time. A prepayment penalty or fee shall not be required for the sale, refinancing, or resyndication other than any prepayment penalty or fee owing to the holders of notes or bonds issued to finance a housing project under this section, except that the owner shall pay all fees of the authority described in subsection (10) before or concurrent with the sale, refinancing, or resyndication. For student housing, a transfer of ownership shall be approved by a resolution of the college or university board of trustees for the college or university that approved the initial financing under this section. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A borrower is allowed distributions equal to a 12% return on the borrower's investment in a multifamily housing project financed under this section for the first 12 months of operation of the housing project following substantial completion. The allowable return shall be increased by 1% for each 12-month period after the first 12 months. The maximum allowable return for a housing project located in other than an eligible distressed area is 25%. Any return less than the allowable rate in any preceding period may be received in any subsequent period on a cumulative basis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Before September 1 of each year, the owner of a housing project financed under this section shall report to the authority all of the following, which the authority shall include in the report required by section 32(14):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The incomes of the tenants residing in that housing project in a manner that preserves the anonymity of those tenants.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The estimated economic and social benefits of that housing project to the immediate neighborhoods in which it has been constructed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The estimated economic and social benefits of that housing project to the city in which it has been constructed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Information requested by the authority about that housing project that is needed so that the authority can report the extent of displacement, direct and indirect, of lower income persons caused by housing projects financed under this section, the steps taken by governmental and private parties to ameliorate the displacement, and the results of those efforts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Information requested by the authority about that housing project that is needed so that the authority can report the estimated extent of additional reinvestment activities by private lenders attributable to the authority's financing of housing projects financed under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Except for housing for students, the age, race, family size, and average income of the tenants of these housing projects.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The estimated economic impact of these housing projects, including the number of construction jobs created, wages paid, and taxes and payments in lieu of taxes paid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) Mortgages securing loans made under this section are authority-aided mortgages.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) The authority may inspect and audit projects and records of projects financed under this section in order to monitor compliance with the requirements of this section. If there is noncompliance, the authority, pursuant to the provisions of the financing and organizational documents applicable to the transaction, may pursue the remedies that the authority considers appropriate. Except as is required to ensure compliance with this section or section 46 or otherwise required by purchasers of, or a third party credit enhancement provider with respect to, notes or bonds issued to finance a multifamily housing project under this section, the authority shall not regulate, in any manner, a multifamily housing project financed under this section. This section does not preclude the authority from regulating a multifamily housing project in consideration for other types of program benefits, incentives, or concessions provided by the authority in addition to the financing made available under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, there shall not be any liability on the part of the authority or its members, officers, employees, or agents, and the assets of the authority shall not be subject to any liability, as a result of any act or failure to act under this section on the part of the authority or its members, officers, employees, or agents.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) If notes or bonds have been issued under this section for a project located in an eligible distressed area within 180 days before the submission, by the same borrower or a borrower having the same general partners, of a commitment for credit enhancement, that borrower's application shall be given priority over the other applications submitted under this section to finance projects located in other than eligible distressed areas, except for projects for which the authority has authorized loan commitments. The principal amount of notes or bonds issued to finance a project given priority under this subsection shall not exceed 10 times the principal amount of the notes or bonds issued to finance the distressed area project that qualifies the borrower for priority consideration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) Except for housing projects for which the authority has adopted an inducement resolution on or before April 1, 1991, loans shall not be made under this section unless the authority determines that use of the state's unified volume cap for a project will not impair the ability of the authority to carry out programs or finance housing developments or housing units which are targeted to lower income persons.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) Beginning January 3, 2005, a person or entity who proposes a student housing project shall cooperate with the college or university from which the majority of tenants are proposed to be drawn by using its best efforts to communicate with the college or university regarding the location of and the need for the project. If, in the judgment of the authority, the person or entity proposing the project does not communicate with the college or university and the unit of local government where the project is located regarding the location of and need for the project, the authority may deny financing for the project. The authority shall not make a financing commitment for a housing project unless the board of trustees of the college or university from which a majority of students are anticipated to be residents of the housing project adopts a resolution in support of the proposed development.</div>

The showing constitutes a defense to the action and defeats the deficiency judgment against the defendant, either in whole or in part to that extent. This section does not affect nor apply to the rights of other purchasers or of innocent third parties, nor shall it be held to affect or defeat the negotiability of any note, or other obligation secured by such mortgage or other instrument. The proceedings described in this section in no way affect the title of the purchaser to the lands acquired by such purchase. This section does not apply to foreclosure sales made pursuant to an order or decree of court nor to any judgment sought or rendered in any foreclosure suit nor to any chancery sale made and confirmed.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The owner of supportive housing property shall file with the local assessing officer a notification of that status, which shall be in an affidavit form as provided by the authority. The completed affidavit form first shall be submitted to the authority before November 1 of the year preceding the tax year in which the exemption is to begin for certification by the authority that the project is supportive housing property. The owner then shall file the certified notification of the exemption with the local assessing officer before December 1 of the year preceding the tax year in which the exemption is to begin. The authority shall not accept any affidavits filed with it for certification on or after November 1 of any year. The authority shall certify property as supportive housing property on a first-come, first-served basis. The authority shall not certify more than 250 individual living units in each year, and not more than 62 units certified as supportive housing property for a year can be in a single county. If by November 1 of any year the total number of living units that the authority has certified for that year is fewer than 250 living units, the authority may, subject to the annual state-wide limit of 250 living units, certify additional living units in any county that had previously reached the 62-unit limit. This certification shall be on a first-come, first-served basis, based on affidavits filed with the authority before November 1 of that year, but after the county involved reached the 62-unit limit. If not all of the affidavits can be certified without reaching the 250-unit limit, and the date and time of the filing of those affidavits does not establish which were filed earliest, the authority shall select and certify affidavits within that group randomly, keeping a balance of certified units among counties that have more than 62 certified units.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A governmental subdivision that, before the effective date of this subsection, has elected to exempt itself pursuant to section 8(1) may reverse that election, making itself subject to the act and the code. However, that action shall not take effect until 60 days after passage of an ordinance to that effect. A structure commenced under an effective code shall be completed under that code.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A governmental subdivision that, before the effective date of this subsection, has not administered and enforced either this act and the code or another nationally recognized model code may elect to enforce this act and the code pursuant to subsection (1) by the passage of an ordinance to that effect. A governmental subdivision that makes this election after the effective date of this subsection shall submit, in addition to the ordinance, an application to the commission for approval to administer and enforce that code within its jurisdiction. This application shall be made on the proper form to be provided by the commission. The standards for approval shall include, but not be limited to, the certification by the governmental subdivision that the enforcing agency is qualified by experience or training to administer and enforce the code and all related acts and rules, that agency personnel are provided as necessary, administrative services are provided, plan review services are provided, and timely field inspection services shall be provided. The director shall seek additional information if the director considers it necessary. The commission shall render a decision on the application for approval to administer and enforce the code that has been adopted and transmit its findings to that governmental subdivision within 90 days of receipt of the application. The commission shall document its reasons if the commission disapproves an application. A governmental subdivision that receives a disapproval may resubmit its application for approval. Upon receipt of approval from the commission for the administration and enforcement of the code, the governmental subdivision shall administer and enforce the code within its jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of its approved application.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The code or any of its sections shall take effect 6 months after the code's initial promulgation. The 6-month delay does not apply to rules promulgated to implement sections 13a, 13b, 13c, 19, and 21 and the requirements of barrier free design and energy conservation of this act and code. The 6-month delay does not apply to amendments to the code or any of the code's sections after the initial promulgation.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Specified classes or types of buildings or structures, according to use, or other distinctions as may make differentiation or separate classification or regulation necessary, proper, or desirable. The commission shall consider the specific problems of the construction or alteration of a single family, owner-occupied recreational dwelling that is located in a sparsely populated area and that is to be occupied on a part-time basis.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Specified areas of the state based on size, population density, special conditions prevailing in the area, or other factors as may make differentiation or separate classification or regulation necessary, proper, or desirable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   A building or structure that has baby changing stations in the women's restrooms shall have baby changing stations in the men's restrooms.</DIV>

If pursuant to section 23, a governmental subdivision has by ordinance designated a violation of the act or code as a municipal civil infraction, the governmental subdivision may issue a citation or municipal ordinance violation notice pursuant to chapter 87 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.8701 to 600.8735, for a violation of the act or code. Unless otherwise provided by local law or ordinance, the legislative body of a governmental subdivision responsible for administration and enforcement of this act and the code shall designate an enforcing agency that shall discharge the responsibilities of the governmental subdivision under this act. Governmental subdivisions may provide by agreement for joint enforcement of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Subject to the other provisions of this act, an enforcing agency is any official or agent of a governmental subdivision that is registered under article 10 of the skilled trades regulation act, MCL 339.6001 to 339.6023, and qualified by experience or training to perform the duties associated with construction code administration and enforcement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Before December 28, 1999, the director shall provide each governmental subdivision administering and enforcing this act and the code with a notice of intent form. This form shall set forth the date return receipt is required, which date shall not be less than 60 days. The chief elected official of the governmental subdivision that receives this notice shall indicate on the form the intention of the governmental subdivision as to whether it shall continue to administer and enforce this act and the code and transmit this notice to the director within the prescribed period. If a governmental subdivision fails to submit a notice of intent to continue to administer and enforce this act and the code within the date set forth in the notice, the director shall send a notice by registered mail to the clerk of that governmental subdivision. This notice shall indicate that the governmental subdivision has 15 additional days in which to submit a notice of intent to continue to administer and enforce this act and the code. If the governmental subdivision does not respond by the end of the 15 additional days, it shall be conclusively presumed that the governmental subdivision does not intend to continue to administer and enforce this act and the code and the director shall assume the responsibility for administering and enforcing this act and the code in that governmental subdivision, unless the county within which the governmental subdivision is located submits a notice of intent to continue to administer and enforce this act and the code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A county that is administering and enforcing this act and the code on December 28, 1999 and that submits a notice of intent to continue to administer and enforce this act and the code pursuant to subsection (4) is responsible for the administration and enforcement of this act and the code for each governmental subdivision within the county that does not submit a notice of intent to continue to administer and enforce this act and the code. The director shall notify the county of those governmental subdivisions that do not submit a notice of intent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A governmental subdivision that, before December 28, 1999, did not administer and enforce this act and the code may elect to assume the responsibility for the administration and enforcement of this act and the code pursuant to subsection (1) by the passage of an ordinance to that effect. A governmental subdivision that makes this election after December 28, 1999 shall submit, in addition to the ordinance, an application to the commission for approval to administer and enforce this act and the code within its jurisdiction. This application shall be made on the proper form to be provided by the commission. The standards for approval shall include, but not be limited to, the certification by the governmental subdivision that the enforcing agency is qualified by experience or training to administer and enforce this act and the code and all related acts and rules, that agency personnel are provided as necessary, that administrative services are provided, that plan review services are provided, and that timely field inspection services will be provided. The director shall seek additional information if the director considers it necessary. The commission shall render a decision on the application for approval to administer and enforce this act and the code and transmit its findings to the governmental subdivision within 90 days of receipt of the application. The commission shall document its reasons, if the commission disapproves an application. A governmental subdivision that receives a disapproval may resubmit its application for approval. Upon receipt of approval from the commission for the administration and enforcement of this act and the code, the governmental subdivision shall administer and enforce this act and the code within its jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of this act and the application.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A governmental subdivision that elects to administer and enforce this act and the code within its jurisdiction by the adoption of an ordinance may rescind that ordinance and transfer the responsibility for the administration and enforcement of this act and the code to the director. The director shall assume the responsibility for administering and enforcing this act and the code in that governmental subdivision, unless the county within which that governmental subdivision is located has submitted a notice of intent to continue to administer and enforce the code. However, that action shall not take effect until 12 months after the passage of an ordinance to that effect. A structure commenced under an effective code shall be completed under that code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The director is responsible for administration and enforcement of this act and the code for buildings and structures that are not under the responsibility of an enforcing agency in those governmental subdivisions that elect to administer and enforce this act and the code. A building or structure owned by the state shall not be erected, remodeled, or reconstructed in the state, except school buildings or facilities or institutions of higher education as described in section 4 of article VIII of the state constitution of 1963, until written approval of the plans and specifications has been obtained from the bureau of construction codes and safety located within the department indicating that the state owned facilities shall be designed and constructed in conformance with the state construction code. The bureau of construction codes and safety shall be the lead agency in the coordination and implementation of this subsection. The bureau of construction codes and safety shall perform required plan reviews and inspections as required by the state construction code. Each department shall secure required plan approvals and permits from the bureau. Fees charged by the bureau for permits shall be in accordance with the commission's approved schedule of fees. State departments and institutions may allow local inspectors to inspect the construction of state owned facilities. However, an inspection conducted by a local inspector shall be of an advisory nature only.</div>

These standards shall ensure that consistent, uniform, and equitable construction requirements and state supervision of the requirements are achieved. This subsection does not preclude a state agency or a governmental subdivision from conducting plan reviews or inspections necessary to ensure compliance with approved construction plans.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Except as otherwise provided in this act, this act does not limit or restrict existing powers or authority of governmental subdivisions, and this act shall be enforced by governmental subdivisions in the manner prescribed by local law or ordinance. To the extent not inconsistent with this act, local laws and ordinances relating to administration and enforcement of construction regulations enacted before the effective date of the code by or for a governmental subdivision are applicable to administration and enforcement of the code in that governmental subdivision.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 9b.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The director, as prescribed in this section, may conduct a performance evaluation of an enforcing agency to assure that the administration and enforcement of this act and the code is being done pursuant to either section 8a or 8b. A performance evaluation may only be conducted either at the request of the local enforcing agency or upon the receipt of a written complaint. If a performance evaluation is to be conducted upon the receipt of a written complaint, the director shall first refer the written complaint to the affected enforcing agency requesting a written response within 10 days. If the local enforcing agency fails to provide a written response, or if the response is considered inadequate, the director shall consult with the commission and request approval to conduct the performance evaluation. The director shall submit a written recommendation to the commission and shall send a copy to the affected enforcing agency, along with a reasonable notice of the commission meeting at which the recommendation will be presented. The decision of the commission to proceed with a performance evaluation shall be made at a public meeting. This decision shall be mailed to the enforcing agency 10 days in advance of conducting the performance evaluation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   When conducting a performance evaluation of an enforcing agency, the director may request that the local enforcing agency accompany the director or other state inspectors on inspections. The inspections shall be for the enforcement of this act and the code. The enforcing agency shall maintain all official records and documents relating to applications for permits, inspection records including correction notices, orders to stop construction, and certificates of use and occupancy. The enforcing agency shall make available for review all official records between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on business days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Upon completion of a performance evaluation, the director shall report the findings and any recommendations to the commission and the local enforcing agency. The commission may issue a notice of intent to withdraw the responsibility for the administration and enforcement of this act and the code from a governmental subdivision after receiving the results of a performance evaluation. The notice shall include the right to appeal within 30 business days after receipt of the notice of intent to withdraw the responsibility. The notice shall also include the findings of the director, after completion of a performance evaluation, that the enforcing agency of that governmental subdivision has failed to follow the duties recognized under this act, the code, or its ordinance. Failure by the enforcing agency or the chief elected official of that governmental subdivision to request a hearing within 30 business days after receipt of the notice of intent to withdraw the responsibility shall be considered to exhaust the enforcing agency's administrative remedies and the notice shall be considered a final order of the commission under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328. The director shall assume responsibility for the administration and enforcement of this act and the code, unless the county within which that governmental subdivision is located has submitted a notice of intent to continue to administer and enforce this act and the code, when the notice is considered a final order of the commission. A structure commenced under an effective code shall be completed under that code.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If an enforcing agency or the chief elected official of the governmental subdivision transmits an appeal of the notice of intent to withdraw the responsibility issued under subsection (3), the commission chairperson shall request appointment of a hearings officer. The hearings officer shall conduct a hearing of the appeal pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, and issue a proposed decision which shall be sent to the affected parties. The proposed decision shall become the final order issued by the commission, unless exceptions are filed by a party within 30 days after receipt of the proposed decision. The commission shall review the proposed decision when exceptions are filed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The commission in reviewing a proposed decision may affirm, modify, reverse, or remand the proposed decision. When the commission affirms, modifies, reverses, or remands a proposed decision, the decision of the commission shall be in writing and contain the findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which its decision is based. Other than in a case of remand, the period for seeking judicial review of the commission's decision under section 104 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.304, shall begin to run upon receipt by the parties of the commission's written decision.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 11.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    The enforcing agency shall examine an application for a building permit. If the application conforms to this act, the code and the requirements of other applicable laws and ordinances, the enforcing agency shall approve the application and issue a building permit to the applicant. An application shall be granted, in whole or in part, or denied within 10 business days, except that in case of an unusually complicated building or structure, action shall be taken within 15 business days. Failure by an enforcing agency to grant, in whole or in part, or deny an application within these periods of time shall be deemed a denial of the application for purposes of authorizing the institution of an appeal to the appropriate board of appeals. The enforcing agency shall approve changes in plans and specifications previously approved by it, if the changes require approval and if the plans and specifications when so changed remain in conformity with law. Except as otherwise provided in this act or the code, the construction or alteration of a building or structure shall not be commenced until a building permit has been issued. The construction of a building or structure shall comply with the approved application for a building permit, and the enforcing agency shall insure such compliance in the manner provided in section 12 and in any other way it deems appropriate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The enforcing agency may suspend, revoke or cancel a building permit in case of failure or neglect to comply with the provisions of this act or the code, or upon a finding by it that a false statement or representation has been made in the application for the building permit.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 12.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    An enforcing agency shall periodically inspect all construction undertaken pursuant to a building permit issued by it to insure that the construction is performed in accordance with conditions of the building permit and is consistent with requirements of the code and other applicable laws and ordinances.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The owner of premises on which a building or structure is being constructed is deemed to have consented to inspection by the enforcing agency and the commission of the entire premises and of any construction being performed on it until a certificate of use and occupancy has been issued. An inspector, or team of inspectors, on presentation of proper credentials, may enter and inspect the premises and construction thereon, for purposes of insuring compliance with the building permit, the code and other applicable laws and regulations. An inspection shall be made between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. on business days, or when construction is actually being undertaken, except if the enforcing agency has probable cause to believe that an immediate danger to life, limb or property exists, or except with permission of an owner, or his agent, architect, engineer or builder. An inspection pursuant to this section shall be solely for purposes of enforcing this act and other laws and ordinances related to construction of buildings and structures. A person other than the owner, his agent, architect, engineer or builder shall not accompany an inspector or team of inspectors on an inspection, unless his presence is necessary for the enforcement of this act, or other laws and ordinances related to construction of the building or structure, or except with the consent of an owner, or his agent, architect, engineer or builder.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If construction is being undertaken contrary to a building permit, this act, or other applicable laws or ordinances, the enforcing agency shall give written notice to the holder of the building permit, or if a permit has not been issued then to the person doing the construction, notifying him of the violation of this act, or other applicable laws and ordinances, and to appear and show cause why the construction should not be stopped. If the person doing the construction is not known, or cannot be located with reasonable effort, the notice may be delivered to the person in charge of, or apparently in charge of, the construction. If the holder of the permit or the person doing the construction fails to appear and show good cause within 1 full working day after notice is delivered, the enforcing agency shall cause a written order to stop construction to be posted on the premises. A person shall not continue, or cause or allow to be continued, construction in violation of a stop construction order, except with permission of the enforcing agency to abate the dangerous condition or remove the violation, or except by court order. If an order to stop construction is not obeyed, the enforcing agency may apply to the circuit court for the county in which the premises are located for an order enjoining the violation of the stop construction order. This remedy is in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedy provided by law or ordinance, and does not prevent criminal prosecution for failure to obey the order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Without limitation on other available remedies, an interested person may apply for an order, enjoining the continuation of construction undertaken in violation of a building permit, this act, the code or other applicable laws or ordinances, to the circuit court for the county in which the premises are located.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 13.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A building or structure hereafter constructed shall not be used or occupied in whole or in part until a certificate of use and occupancy has been issued by the appropriate enforcing agency. A building or structure hereafter altered in whole or in part shall not be used or occupied until such a certificate has been issued, except that a use or occupancy in an already existing building or structure that was not discontinued during its alteration may be continued for 30 days after completion of the alteration without issuance of a certificate of use and occupancy. A certificate of use and occupancy shall be issued by the enforcing agency when the work covered by a building permit has been completed in accordance with the permit, the code and other applicable laws and ordinances. On request of a holder of a building permit the enforcing agency may issue a temporary certificate of use and occupancy for a building or structure, or part thereof, before the entire work covered by the building permit has been completed, if the parts of the building or structure to be covered by the certificate may be occupied before completion of all the work in accordance with the permit, the code and other applicable laws and ordinances, without endangering the health or safety of the occupants or users. When a building or structure is entitled thereto, the enforcing agency shall issue a certificate of use and occupancy within 5 business days after receipt of a written application therefor on a form to be prescribed by the enforcing agency and payment of the fee to be established by it. The certificate of use and occupancy shall certify that the building or structure has been constructed in accordance with the building permit, the code and other applicable laws and ordinances. The application for a certificate of use and occupancy for a new dwelling with a unit or units for rent shall set forth the information required in an application for a certificate of compliance for such a dwelling pursuant to the state housing law, and the certificate of use and occupancy for such a dwelling shall be deemed its initial certificate of compliance. The enforcing agency shall give the owner of the building or structure or his agent at least 12 hours' notice of the time of any final inspection, by the enforcing agency of the work covered by the building permit, pursuant to the application for a certificate of use and occupancy.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 15.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    After a public hearing a board of appeals may grant a specific variance to a substantive requirement of the code if the literal application of the substantive requirement would result in an exceptional, practical difficulty to the applicant, and if both of the following requirements are satisfied:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The performance of the particular item or part of the building or structure with respect to which the variance is granted shall be adequate for its intended use and shall not substantially deviate from performance required by the code of that particular item or part for the health, safety and welfare of the people of this state. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The specific condition justifying the variance shall be neither so general nor recurrent in nature as to make an amendment of the code with respect to the condition reasonably practical or desirable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A board of appeals may attach in writing any condition in connection with the granting of a variance that in its judgment is necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the people of this state. The breach of a condition shall automatically invalidate the variance and any permit, license and certificate granted on the basis of it. In no case shall more than minimum variance from the code be granted than is necessary to alleviate the exceptional, practical difficulty.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 16.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An interested person, or the interested person's authorized agent, may appeal a decision of a board of appeals to the commission within 10 business days after filing of the decision with the enforcing agency or, in case of an appeal because of failure of a board of appeals to act within the prescribed time, at any time before filing of the decision. The hearing of an appeal based on the denial of a request for a variance by a board of appeals is within the sole discretion of the commission. If deciding an appeal, the commission may act either as a whole or by a panel of 3 or more of the commission members designated by the commission's chairperson to hear and decide the appeal. A majority of a panel constitutes a quorum and a decision by a panel requires concurrence of at least a majority of the panel's members. If an appeal has been presented to the commission within the time prescribed, the appeal shall be heard de novo by the commission. The commission may affirm, modify, or reverse a decision of the board of appeals or the enforcing agency. Except if modified or reversed by a court of competent jurisdiction, a decision of the commission made under this section is binding on the applicant and the affected board of appeals and enforcing agency. An appeal to the commission shall be decided within 30 days after receipt of the appeal by the commission. A copy of the decision and a statement of reasons for the decision shall be sent to the applicant and filed with the affected board of appeals and enforcing agency within 5 business days after the making of the decision. A record of decisions made by the commission under this section, properly indexed, shall be kept in the office of the commission, and be open to public inspection during business hours in compliance with the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Notwithstanding subsection (1), the executive director of the commission shall refer an appeal to the commission under subsection (1) which in the executive director's judgment relates principally to a mechanical, plumbing, electrical, or barrier free design matter to the appropriate board. The board shall hear and decide the appeal in the same manner as an appeal is heard and decided by the commission under this section, except that a board shall meet as a whole and not in a panel. A person aggrieved by a decision of a board on any appeal under this subsection may petition the commission to review the decision. The commission shall act on the petition within 5 business days after receipt, and may grant the petition at the commission's discretion except that the commission shall grant the petition if it appears that the appeal involves a question of major significance to the people of this state and that the case of the appellant has substantial merit. If the commission grants the petition, the commission acting as a whole shall review the decision in accordance with a procedure established by the commission's rules.</DIV>

In other cases, an appeal to a board of appeals, or to the commission pursuant to this act, or to a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, as amended, shall act as a stay upon an order, determination, decision or action appealed from, unless the enforcing agency establishes that immediate enforcement of the order, determination, decision or action is necessary to avoid substantial peril to life or property.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 19.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The department shall promulgate rules establishing a procedure by which a premanufactured unit intended for use in this state may be issued a certificate of acceptability by the department at its place of manufacture.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The procedure shall require that the manufacturer submit to the department detailed plans and specifications for the premanufactured unit for approval as in compliance with the code. The department may require that the manufacturer submit test results on the premanufactured unit or its components, any material or information the department considers relevant, or 1 or more of the premanufactured units for testing and evaluation by the department. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Each premanufactured unit shall be inspected by the department, or a qualified person approved by the department, to determine that the premanufactured unit has been manufactured in accordance with plans and specifications submitted under subsection (2). The department may issue a certificate of acceptability for a premanufactured unit that bears the approved label of an independent, nationally recognized body having follow-up inspection service satisfactory to the commission, certifying that the premanufactured unit complies with plans and specifications submitted under subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Plans and specifications for 1- and 2-family dwelling premanufactured units may be reviewed by the department or by an independent entity approved by the commission under rules promulgated by the department. The department shall establish submission procedures for plans and specifications reviewed by an independent entity approved by the commission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A local enforcing agency may also inspect a premanufactured unit at its place of manufacture to determine that it has been manufactured in accordance with plans and specifications submitted under subsection (2) and shall advise the state inspector and the commission in writing of any deviations found.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   An approved independent entity shall not conduct in-plant inspections of units for which it performed plan reviews. However, the manufacturer may request a variance from the commission if the literal application of the requirements of this section would result in an exceptional, practical difficulty relating to inspection of specific units. For purposes of this subsection, "exceptional, practical difficulty" includes, but is not limited to, a geographic distance between the manufacturing facility where the units are manufactured and the primary business location of the independent entity that conducts in-plant inspections on behalf of the manufacturer of more than 250 miles and is located in another state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If an application for a building permit specifying use of a premanufactured unit with a certificate of acceptability is submitted to an enforcing agency, and if the application, except for the part calling for use of a premanufactured unit with a certificate of acceptability, complies with applicable construction regulations, zoning laws, and local ordinances, the enforcing agency shall issue the building permit within the time specified in this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   At the time of installation, a premanufactured unit with a certificate of acceptability is subject only to the nondestructive tests approved by the department necessary to determine that it has not been damaged in transit or installation, and that it has been installed in accordance with the building permit and construction regulations.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   The fees established for a building permit when the application specifies use of a premanufactured unit with a certificate of acceptability, or for inspection of the installation of the premanufactured unit shall bear a reasonable relation to the costs incurred by the enforcing agency in issuing a permit or performing an inspection. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an enforcing agency may object to use of a premanufactured unit with a certificate of acceptability on the basis that the premanufactured unit does not comply with the code. If an enforcing agency on receipt of an application for a building permit specifying the use of a premanufactured unit does object, it may set forth its objections in writing to the department before issuance of a building permit and within 10 business days after receipt of the application. Within 10 business days after receipt of the objections, the commission, or a panel of 3 or more members designated for that purpose by its chairman, shall hold a hearing on the objections in accordance with rules promulgated by the department. After the hearing, the commission, or its panel, within 3 business days shall determine 1 of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The premanufactured unit does not comply with the code and order that the certificate of acceptability be voided.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The premanufactured unit requires additional testing and evaluation in which case the testing and evaluation shall be conducted in accordance with this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The objections are not valid and order the enforcing agency to issue the building permit within 3 business days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   A certificate of acceptability issued by the department shall not be used for advertising purposes.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A person may petition the commission to approve the use of a particular material, product, method of manufacture or method or manner of construction or installation. The petition shall be in writing on a form to be prescribed by the commission accompanied by such information and material as the commission may by rule require and by an initial fee. On receipt of the petition, the commission shall cause to be conducted testing and evaluation it deems desirable for the particular material, product, method of manufacture or method or manner of construction or installation. After the testing and evaluation, and after a hearing open to the public in which the results of the testing and evaluation are made part of the record, and the petitioner or any other interested party is allowed to present evidence in support of or against the petition, the commission may reject the petition in whole or in part, may in accordance with procedures established in this act amend the code in such manner as the commission deems appropriate, or may grant a certificate of acceptability for the particular material, product, method of manufacture, or method or manner of construction or installation. A petition shall not be rejected if the application is in proper form and the fees are paid, and if performance of the particular material, product, method of manufacture, or method or manner of construction or installation is adequate for its intended use and consistent with reasonable requirements for the health, safety and welfare of the people of this state. The commission may attach any condition it deems appropriate to a certificate of acceptability. A material, product, method of manufacture, or method or manner of construction or installation shall be acceptable for use throughout this state in accordance with the terms of a certificate of acceptability issued with respect to it. A copy of each certificate of acceptability shall be sent or delivered by the commission to each governmental subdivision, however, failure of the commission to comply with this requirement does not prevent or delay effectiveness of a certificate of acceptability. A certificate of acceptability issued by the commission pursuant to this section shall not be used for advertising purposes. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The construction contract shall contain an agreement to submit those matters described in subsection (3) to the decision of an agent at the option of the public agency.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a dispute regarding a matter described in subsection (3) arises, the contractor and the public agency shall designate an agent who has background, training, and experience in the construction of facilities similar to that which is the subject of the contract, as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   In an agreement reached within 10 days after a dispute arises.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The public agency may request dispute resolution by the agent regarding the following:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   At any time after 94% of work under the contract is in place, whether there has been an unacceptable delay by the contractor in the performance of the remaining 6% of work under the contract. The agent shall consider the terms of the contract and the procedures normally followed in the industry and shall determine whether the delay was for failure to follow reasonable and prudent practices in the industry for completion of the project.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   This dispute resolution process shall be used only for the purpose of determining the rights of the parties to retained funds and interest earned on retained funds and is not intended to alter, abrogate, or limit any rights with respect to remedies that are available to enforce or compel performance of the terms of the contract by either party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The agent may request and shall receive all pertinent information from the parties and shall provide an opportunity for an informal meeting to receive comments, documents, and other relevant information in order to resolve the dispute. The agent shall determine the time, place, and procedure for the informal meeting. A written decision and reasons for the decision shall be given to the parties within 14 days after the meeting.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   That there has been unacceptable delay as described in subsection (3)(b), the public agency may contract with a subsequent contractor to complete the remaining 6% of work under the contract, and interest earned on retained funds shall become the property of the public agency.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The dollar value of the original contract, less the dollar value of funds already paid to the original contractor and the dollar value of work in place for which the original contractor has not received payment.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)    Interest earned on retainage from the original contractor, or funds made available under a letter of credit provided under section 3(5).</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   There exists in this state the continuing need for programs to alleviate and prevent conditions of unemployment, and the legislature finds that it is accordingly necessary to assist and retain local industrial and commercial enterprises, including employee-owned corporations, to strengthen and revitalize the economy of this state and its municipalities; that accordingly it is necessary to provide means and methods for the encouragement and assistance of industrial and commercial enterprises, including employee-owned corporations, in locating, purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, modernizing, improving, maintaining, repairing, furnishing, equipping, and expanding in this state and in its municipalities; and that it is also necessary to encourage the location and expansion of industrial and commercial enterprises, including employee-owned corporations, to more conveniently provide needed services and facilities of the industrial and commercial enterprises to municipalities and the residents of the municipalities. It is also necessary to promote economic activity in the forestry and agricultural sectors by providing incentives to combat inflation, to reduce energy consumption, to retain the family farm unit, to reduce the rate at which urban sprawl has been devouring our productive farm lands, and to provide our farmers and foresters with a more favorable export market; all this to be accomplished by reducing costs of production. It is also necessary to encourage the development of facilities designed to produce energy from renewable resources. Therefore, the powers granted in this act constitute the performance of essential public purposes and functions for this state and its municipalities.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Section 1 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 vests the executive power of the State of Michigan in the governor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Section 2 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 empowers the governor to make changes in the organization of the executive branch of state government or in the assignment of functions among its units that the governor considers necessary for efficient administration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>A strong economy requires a concentration of talent. State government must ensure that every Michigander has opportunity through a path to skills that lead to a good job.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Michigan needs increased focus on providing resources and supporting efforts to increase the skill levels of Michigan workers as the skills needed to compete for well-paying jobs are rapidly changing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>As workplaces evolve, many Michiganders will need to acquire new skills to advance—or even just to keep their current jobs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The talent development efforts of Michigan state government will benefit from greater coordination and a focus on achieving the statewide goal of increasing the number of Michigan residents between the ages of 16 and 64 with a post-secondary credential to 60 percent by 2030.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Successful talent development programs can be further improved and enhanced by close coordination with local workforce development boards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Streamlining these programs and including services and programs that protect and promote our skilled and talented labor market will help to provide greater efficiencies and opportunities to engage with job providers and employees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Strengthening and aligning economic development activities with talent development and training opportunities will assist in meeting the needs of Michigan’s job providers and provide enhanced opportunities for Michigan workers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Changing the organization of the executive branch of state government is necessary in the interests of efficient administration and effectiveness of government.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Acting pursuant to the Michigan Constitution of 1963 and Michigan law, I order the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>1.Creating the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Housing is the cornerstone to thriving communities. A successful housing ecosystem provides safe, healthy, affordable, accessible, and attainable housing for all in a community of their choice. Yet, in Michigan, too many families are unable to find affordable housing. According to Michigan's Statewide Housing Needs Assessment, Michigan faces a shortage of owner and renter occupied housing. The most recent Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed (ALICE) Report found that 48% of Michigan renters and 18% of homeowners paid too much for housing (over 30% of their income). This constraint on housing supply, which was decades in the making, is a primary driver of the current affordability crisis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Michigan struggled with a lack of affordable housing before COVID-19. The pandemic amplified the challenge and highlighted the need to increase safety, address issues of quality, and tackle racial disparities. When combined with the ongoing affordability issue, these core challenges further illustrated the need for a statewide housing plan. It is vital to develop strategies that strengthen neighborhoods and communities grappling with a lack of affordable housing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>That's why in 2022 the State of Michigan released its first Statewide Housing Plan, which outlined strategies to tackle the state's affordable housing crisis. Michigan's Statewide Housing Plan includes ambitious goals for the state, including the target of building or rehabilitating over 75,000 housing units statewide in the next five years. The Michigan State Housing Development Authority is well-positioned to begin implementing the Statewide Housing Plan. However, achieving the goals of the Statewide Housing Plan will also require the coordination of state departments and agencies and the focus of state and federal resources around the primary goal of housing access.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Section 1 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 vests the executive power of the State of Michigan in the governor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Section 2 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 empowers the governor to make changes in the organization of the executive branch of state government or in the assignment of functions among its units that the governor considers necessary for efficient administration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Acting under the Michigan Constitution of 1963 and Michigan law, I order the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>

The transfer includes the Michigan Strategic Fund civil service personnel and/or vacancies to assist with the administration of the CDBG Program and includes the program's records, property, and allocations or other funds, if any, related to the 2023 CDBG annual program allocation and all future CDBG annual program allocations.</div>

<Center>Chapter 1<BR>  <BR> </Center><BR><BR><B>125.2001 Legislative finding and declaration.</B><P>
</P>
<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The legislature hereby finds and declares the following problems and objectives:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The economy of the state of Michigan is at present recovering from a recession and action is needed to encourage increased employment and business expansion in this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The economy of the state of Michigan is undergoing a long-term transition requiring new and innovative policies from state government and greater coordination of existing policies and programs related to jobs and economic development.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   It is necessary to provide a mechanism to foster greater coordination of state policies and to make available public and private development finance opportunities to agriculture, forestry, business, and industry, and to communities within the state, in order to expand the number of jobs in the state and to help agriculture, forestry, business, and industry prosper in the state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   There exists a need to leverage private sector investment in new and innovative products, in entrepreneurial activity, and in economic development finance; therefore, state assistance for development finance should reflect a leveraging investment strategy.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   There is a statewide pressing need for programs to alleviate and prevent conditions of unemployment; to preserve existing jobs and create new jobs to meet the employment demands of population growth and population shifts; to promote the development of existing business enterprises and to meet the growing competition among states and nations for business enterprises; to revitalize and diversify the Michigan economy in general to achieve the goals of long-term economic growth and full employment, and to provide a solid tax base for the state and its local units of government to provide funds for needed public services. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The goals of long-term economic growth and full employment can best be provided by the promotion, attraction, stimulation, retention, rehabilitation, and revitalization of business enterprises and worker-owned enterprises and by actions to lower the costs of business and production.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   The retention, promotion, diversification, and development of business enterprises and the lowering of costs of business and production require additional means of financing, including economic development finance mechanisms that support private capital resources, to help existing business enterprises expand more rapidly, and to promote the location of additional business enterprises in Michigan.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   It is necessary to provide means and methods for the encouragement and assistance of industrial and commercial development projects, including but not limited to providing aid to development enterprises utilizing new or experimental technologies in locating, purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, modernizing, improving, maintaining, repairing, furnishing, equipping, and expanding in this state and its local units of government.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The retention and expansion of existing business enterprise and the acquiring of new business enterprises to Michigan requires the availability of energy supplies and that, to this end, known sources of energy in Michigan should be developed to the fullest extent possible consistent with environmental protection and ecological preservation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)   To conserve the public benefits of nonrenewable oil, gas, and mineral resources which are now subject to increasing development and depletion it is necessary to apply the proceeds of such resources to the encouragement of capital growth and the financing of self-sustaining sources of economic activity.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(k)   It is necessary to promote economic activity in the forestry and agricultural sectors by providing incentives to reduce energy consumption, to retain agricultural and forestry enterprises, to reduce the rate at which urban sprawl has been devouring productive farm and forestry lands, and to provide our farmers and foresters with a more favorable export market. It is also necessary to encourage the development of facilities designed to produce energy from renewable resources.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(l)    For the preservation and betterment of the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of Michigan, it is necessary to promote and develop new and adequate water and air pollution control and solid waste disposal facilities for business enterprises and public utilities located in this state, which equipment or facilities need not be incidental to an industrial building, but may serve the general public.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(m)   It is necessary for a sound economy of the state for the local units of government of the state to provide quality services and this requires an adequate and modern infrastructure in the local units of government which makes it necessary for such units to finance local improvements in an economical manner which in many cases can be best done through assistance by the state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(n)   The lending and investment of funds to develop and improve the economy of the state requires specialized and unique knowledge, skills, and experience.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>As used in this act: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Board" means the board of directors of the Michigan strategic fund, except where the context clearly requires a different definition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Economic development project" means an endeavor related to industrial, commercial, or agricultural enterprise. Economic development project includes, but is not limited to, a theme or recreation park; agricultural or forestry production, harvesting, storage, or processing facilities or equipment; port facilities; and the use of equipment or facilities designed to produce energy from renewable resources. Economic development project does not include that portion of an endeavor devoted to the sale of goods at retail, except that, as used in relation to the fund insuring a transaction entered into by a depository institution, and as used in relation to a loan by the fund to a minority owned business, an economic development project may include that portion of an endeavor devoted to the sale of goods at retail. Economic development project does not include that portion of an endeavor devoted to housing or a program or activity authorized under chapter 8A.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Financial institution" means a state or nationally chartered bank or a state or federally chartered savings and loan association, savings bank, or credit union whose deposits are insured by an agency of the United States government and that maintains a principal office or branch office in this state under the laws of this state or the United States.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Fund" means the Michigan strategic fund created under section 5, except where the context clearly requires a different definition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) "FWC Qualified Settlement Fund" means the FWC Qualified Settlement Fund described in the settlement agreement approved by the court in In re Flint Water Cases, No. 5:16-cv-10444-JEL-MKM (ED Mich).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) "Green chemistry" means chemistry and chemical engineering to design chemical products or processes that reduce or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances, while producing high-quality products through safe and efficient manufacturing processes. Green chemistry is guided by the following 12 principles:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Prevent waste: Design chemical syntheses to prevent waste, leaving no waste to treat or clean up.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Design safer chemicals and products: Design chemical products to be fully effective, yet have little or no toxicity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Design less hazardous chemical syntheses: Design syntheses to use and generate substances with little or no toxicity to humans and the environment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Use renewable feedstocks: Use raw materials and feedstocks that are renewable rather than depleting.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Use catalysts, not stoichiometric reagents: Minimize waste by using catalytic reactions. Catalysts are used in small amounts and can carry out a single reaction many times. They are preferable to stoichiometric reagents, which are used in excess and work only once.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) Avoid chemical derivatives: Avoid using blocking or protecting groups or any temporary modifications if possible. Derivatives use additional reagents and generate waste.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vii) Maximize atom economy: Design syntheses so that the final product contains the maximum proportion of the starting materials. There should be few, if any, wasted atoms.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(viii) Use safer solvents and reaction conditions: Avoid using solvents, separation agents, or other auxiliary chemicals. If these chemicals are necessary, use innocuous chemicals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ix) Increase energy efficiency: Run chemical reactions at ambient temperature and pressure whenever possible.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(x) Design chemicals and products to degrade after use: Design chemical products to break down to innocuous substances after use so that they do not accumulate in the environment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(xi) Analyze in real-time to prevent pollution: Include in-process real-time monitoring and control during syntheses to minimize or eliminate the formation of by-products.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(xii) Minimize the potential for accidents: Design chemicals and their forms, including solid, liquid, or gas, to minimize the potential for chemical accidents, including explosions, fires, and releases to the environment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) "Michigan economic development corporation" or "MEDC" means the Michigan economic development corporation, the public body corporate created under section 28 of article VII of the state constitution of 1963 and the urban cooperation act of 1967, 1967 (Ex Sess) PA 7, MCL 124.501 to 124.512, by a contractual interlocal agreement effective April 5, 1999, and subsequently amended, between local participating economic development corporations formed under the economic development corporations act, 1974 PA 338, MCL 125.1601 to 125.1636, and the fund.</div>

To the extent that the production company elects not to withhold, it shall notify the above the line personnel of their registration obligations in writing at the time of engagement for their services.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The extent to which state funding will attract private investment for the production of qualified productions in this state.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the Michigan film office determines that an eligible production company has complied with the terms of an agreement entered into under this section, the office shall award funding as provided in this section. A person that willfully submits information under this section that the person knows to be fraudulent or false shall, in addition to any other penalties provided by law, be liable for a civil penalty equal to the amount of funding provided to the person under this section.

Information, records, or other data shall only be considered confidential to the extent that the information or records describe the commercial and financial operations or intellectual property of the company, the information or records have not been publicly disseminated at any time, and disclosure of the information or records may put the company at a competitive disadvantage. For purposes of this subsection, information or records that describe commercial and financial operations do not include that portion of information or records that include any expenses that qualify under this section as direct production expenditures or qualified personnel expenditures.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The office shall produce a performance dashboard for the assistance authorized by this section.

The Michigan economic development corporation may waive the Michigan resident hiring requirement described in subsection (10) if the Michigan economic development corporation determines that there is an insufficient number of qualified Michigan residents for the qualified production. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The legislature finds and declares that funding authorized under this section to encourage diversification of the economy, to encourage film production, to encourage investment, and to encourage the creation of jobs in this state is a public purpose and of paramount concern in the interest of the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of this state. It is the intent of the legislature that the economic benefits, film production, investment, and the creation of jobs resulting from this section shall accrue substantially within this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The fund board may authorize the use of money appropriated for the program authorized by this section for administration of the program.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(s) Any other additional criteria approved by the board that are specific to each individual project and are consistent with the findings and intent of this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An application shall be approved or denied not more than 90 days after receipt of the application that is considered administratively complete by the board or its designee. If the application is neither approved nor denied within 90 days after being considered administratively complete, it must be considered by the fund board, or its president if delegated, for action at, or by, the next regularly scheduled board meeting. If an application is approved, the fund shall determine the amount of community revitalization incentives for the project based on the fund's review of the application and the criteria specified in subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the amount of community revitalization incentives that the board may approve for a single project shall not exceed 25% of a project's eligible investment up to $10,000,000.00. However, in a city, village, or township with a population of 15,000 or less based on the most recent federal decennial census, the amount of community revitalization incentives that the board may approve for a single project shall not exceed 50% of a project's eligible investment up to $10,000,000.00. A community revitalization loan shall not exceed $10,000,000.00, and a community revitalization grant shall not exceed $1,500,000.00. However, a combination of loans, grants, and other economic assistance under this chapter shall not exceed $10,000,000.00 per project. The board may not approve $10,000,000.00 per project in community revitalization incentives to more than 3 projects per fiscal year. The board shall approve not less than 5 projects of $1,000,000.00 or less per project per fiscal year. If, after reviewing all applications in a fiscal year, the fund determines that less than 5 projects warranted an award of $1,000,000.00 or less, this subsection does not apply. Notwithstanding any other limitation in this subsection, each year, of the community revitalization projects approved by the board, the board may approve up to 3 single projects that shall not exceed 50% of a project's eligible investment up to $10,000,000.00 for community revitalization loans and grants for the specific purpose of historic preservation. Beginning for the 2017-2018 fiscal year and through the 2021-2022 fiscal year, except as otherwise provided in subsection (9), not less than 5% of community revitalization incentives shall be awarded to neighborhood and commercial corridor food initiatives.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) When the board approves an application and determines the amount of community revitalization incentives, the board shall enter into a written agreement with the applicant. The written agreement must provide in a clear and concise manner all of the conditions imposed, including specific time frames, on the applicant to receive the community revitalization incentive under this chapter. The written agreement must provide for the secured status of any loan, repayment, and penalties if the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of the written agreement as determined by the board. The applicant shall agree to provide the data described in the written agreement that is necessary for the fund to report to the legislature under this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Not more than 4% of the annual appropriation as provided by law from the 21st century jobs trust fund established in the Michigan trust fund act, 2000 PA 489, MCL 12.251 to 12.262, may be used for the purposes of administering the programs and activities authorized under this chapter. However, the fund and the fund board shall not use more than 3% of the annual appropriation for administering the programs and activities authorized under this chapter unless the fund board by a 2/3 vote authorizes the additional 1% for administration. The MEDC may charge actual and reasonable fees for costs associated with the community revitalization incentive authorized under this chapter. These fees are in addition to an amount of the appropriation used for administering the programs and activities authorized under this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The application process for community revitalization incentives for neighborhood and commercial corridor food initiatives must provide that applications for neighborhood and commercial corridor food initiatives must be received on or before June 1 for that fiscal year. If there are insufficient approved applications in a fiscal year for community revitalization incentives for neighborhood and commercial corridor food initiatives, then the remaining allocated funds may be used for community revitalization incentives that are not for neighborhood and commercial corridor food initiatives as determined by the board. In addition, a new neighborhood and commercial corridor food initiative, as determined by the board, is not eligible for a community revitalization incentive if it is located within 1 mile of an existing retail supermarket, grocery store, or produce market, as determined by the board, that offers unprocessed USDA-inspected meat and poultry products or meat products that carry the USDA organic seal, fresh fruits and vegetables, and dairy products for sale to the public.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The legislature finds and declares that funding authorized under this section is intended to encourage diversification of the economy, to encourage capital investment in this state, to promote the creation of qualified new jobs in this state, and to promote the investment in brownfield and historic preservation projects that reclaim previously used property that is less likely to be revitalized without the investment.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The tax levied under subsection (2) is an annual tax payable at the same times, in the same installments, and to the same officer or officers as taxes imposed under the general property tax act are payable. The officer or officers shall disburse the tax payments received each year under subsection (2), at the same times as taxes imposed under the general property tax act are disbursed, to the local governmental unit in which the property is located.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The tax levied under subsection (3) is an annual tax payable to the same officer or officers as taxes imposed under the general property tax act with 1/2 of the tax levied on July 1 and 1/2 levied on December 1.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The amount that would otherwise be disbursed to a local school district for school operating purposes or to this state under the state education act, Act No. 331 of the Public Acts of 1993, being sections 211.901 to 211.906 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, shall be paid instead to the local governmental unit in which the property is located.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   There shall be paid to the local governmental unit in which the property is located a portion of the tax that would otherwise not be paid to the local governmental unit equal to the proportion of ad valorem property taxes levied on commercial and industrial property in the year before the exemption under section 20a first applies which proportion was captured under a tax increment financing plan.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A local governmental unit that receives money under subsection (5) may enter into an agreement with any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A downtown development authority or tax increment finance authority to share a portion of the money received by the local governmental unit under subsection (5) in not more than the same proportion that the authority would have received if the tax levied under subsection (3) could be captured under a tax increment financing plan. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A taxing unit that receives revenue under subsection (5) to share a portion of the money received by the local governmental unit under subsection (5) not to exceed the taxing unit's net reduction in revenue pursuant to the exemption under section 20a.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The owner of property subject to the tax under subsection (3) may claim a credit against the tax levied on December 1 under subsection (3) for the sum of all the following, but not more than the amount by which the tax levied for the year under subsection (3) exceeds the amount determined by multiplying the average rate of taxation levied upon other commercial, industrial, and utility property upon which ad valorem taxes are assessed as determined each year by the state board of assessors under section 13 of Act No. 282 of the Public Acts of 1905 by the state equalized valuation of that property excluding the exemptions granted by this act:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Cash and in-kind contributions made by that owner during the year to and accepted by a local taxing unit located in the enterprise zone.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The amount of the tax levied upon real property under subsection (2) or (3), until paid, is a lien upon the real property upon which the tax is levied. Only after the officer files a certificate of nonpayment of the tax, together with an affidavit of proof of service of the certificate of nonpayment upon the owner of the property by certified mail, with the register of deeds of the county in which the property is situated, may proceedings be had upon the lien in the same manner as provided by law for the foreclosure in the circuit court of mortgage liens upon real property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   The owner of property who has failed to pay a tax levied under this section is not eligible to claim the credit under subsection (7).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   From the amount disbursed to the local governmental unit pursuant to subsection (5)(a) and (b), the local governmental unit shall disburse to the county in which that local governmental unit is located an amount equal to the product of the state equalized value of all property exempted under sections 20 and 20a(1) and the voter approved special millage rate levied by the county for emergency dispatch services, senior citizen centers, and substance abuse rehabilitation services.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    This section applies only to an owner of property located in an enterprise zone that was created after 1993.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as provided in section 21c, a specific tax is levied in each year upon an owner of property exempted under section 20(2) or 20b, the amount of which is the sum of the following: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The product of 50% of the average rate of taxation levied upon other commercial, industrial, and utility property upon which ad valorem taxes are assessed in that local governmental unit, excluding ad valorem taxes levied under the state education tax act, Act No. 331 of the Public Acts of 1993, being sections 211.901 to 211.906 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, multiplied by the increased state equalized valuation of that property excluding the exemptions granted by this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The product of the millage levied under Act No. 331 of the Public Acts of 1993, multiplied by the increased state equalized valuation of that property, excluding the exemptions granted by this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The product of the total millage levied as ad valorem real and personal property taxes for that year by all local taxing units within which the property is located multiplied by the initial state equalized valuation of that property excluding the exemptions granted by this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The tax levied under subsection (2) is an annual tax payable at the same times, in the same installments, and to the same officer or officers as taxes imposed under the general property tax act are payable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The officer or officers shall disburse the portion of the tax payments received each year calculated under subsection (2)(a), at the same times as taxes imposed under the general property tax act are disbursed, to the local governmental unit in which the property is located to be used solely to make public improvements within the enterprise zone or to repay obligations of which the proceeds are used to make public improvements within the enterprise zone.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The officer or officers shall disburse the portion of the tax payments received each year calculated under subsection (2)(b) and (c) to the same governmental unit, school districts, county, and authorities at the same times and in the same proportions as required by law for the disbursement of taxes collected under the general property tax act. However, if the property is located in a tax increment financing district, the officer or officers shall pay to the tax increment financing authority a portion of the taxes paid equal to the proportion of ad valorem property taxes levied on commercial and industrial property in the enterprise zone in the year before the exemption under section 20(2) first applies which proportion was captured under a tax increment financing plan.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The amount of the tax levied upon real property under subsection (2), until paid, is a lien upon the real property upon which the tax is levied. Only after the officer files a certificate of nonpayment of the tax, together with an affidavit of proof of service of the certificate of nonpayment upon the owner of the property by certified mail, with the register of deeds of the county in which the property is situated, may proceedings be had upon the lien in the same manner as provided by law for the foreclosure in the circuit court of mortgage liens upon real property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A local governmental unit, in its action establishing the boundaries of its enterprise zones, may waive the portion of the tax calculated under subsection (2)(a) and (b) on the real property that would qualify as a replacement facility under section 2(3) of Act No. 198 of the Public Acts of 1974, being section 207.552 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The owner of property who has failed to pay a tax levied under this section is not eligible for the exemption under section 20(2) for the succeeding tax years.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   If a local or intermediate school district receives state aid under section 20, 56, 62, or 81 of the state school aid act of 1979, Act No. 94 of the Public Acts of 1979, being sections 388.1620, 388.1656, 388.1662, and 388.1681 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, of the amount that would otherwise be disbursed under subsection (5) to a local or intermediate school district, all or a portion, to be determined on the basis of the tax rates being utilized to compute the amount of state aid, shall be paid to the state treasury to the credit of the state school aid fund established by section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963. If and for the period that the state school aid act of 1979, Act No. 94 of the Public Acts of 1979, being sections 388.1601 to 388.1772 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, is amended or its successor act is enacted or amended to include a provision that provides for adjustments in state school aid to account for the receipt of revenues provided under this act in place of exempted ad valorem property tax, revenues required to be remitted or returned to the state treasury to the credit of the state school aid fund shall be distributed instead to the local school districts. If the sum of any industrial facility tax levied under Act No. 198 of the Public Acts of 1974, being sections 207.551 to 207.572 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, the commercial facilities tax levied under the commercial redevelopment act, Act No. 255 of the Public Acts of 1978, being sections 207.651 to 207.668 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, the neighborhood enterprise zone tax levied under the neighborhood enterprise zone act, Act No. 147 of the Public Acts of 1992, being sections 207.771 to 207.787 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, and the tax levied under this act paid to the state treasury to the credit of the state school aid fund that would otherwise be disbursed to the local or intermediate school district exceeds the amount received by the local or intermediate school district under section 20, 56, 62, or 81 of Act No. 94 of the Public Acts of 1979, the department of treasury shall allocate to each eligible local or intermediate school district an amount equal to the difference between the sum of the industrial facility tax, the commercial facilities tax, the neighborhood enterprise zone tax, and the tax levied under this act paid to the state treasury to the credit of the state school aid fund and the amount the local or intermediate school district received under section 20, 56, 62, or 81 of Act No. 94 of the Public Acts of 1979.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in subsection (7), a local government that proposes a standard related to mobile home parks or seasonal mobile home parks, or related to mobile homes located within a mobile home park or a seasonal mobile home park, that is higher than the standard provided in this act or the code, or that proposes a standard related to the business, sales, and service practices of mobile home dealers, or the business of mobile home installers and repairers, that is higher than the standard provided in this act or the code, shall file the proposed standard with the commission.

The local government may propose a means to determine which mobile homes located within its jurisdiction are being rented to tenants by the owner, including, but not limited to, imposition of a registration or a licensing requirement for renting mobile homes to tenants. A local government may inspect mobile homes rented to tenants by the owner for safety if the safety inspection ordinance applies to all other rental housing within the local governmental unit. If a local government inspects mobile homes rented to tenants by the owner for safety, the period between inspections shall not be less than 3 years unless the local government is responding to a complaint from a tenant. An inspection shall not be conducted on a mobile home for which an occupancy permit has been issued by the local government in the preceding 3 years unless the local government is responding to a complaint from a tenant. Inspections for safety shall not require enforcement of any mobile home construction standards that are greater than those applicable to the mobile home under the national manufactured housing construction and safety standards act of 1974, 42 USC 5401 to 5426, or standards or codes to which the mobile home was constructed if it was constructed before application of the national manufactured housing construction and safety standards act of 1974, 42 USC 5401 to 5426. As used in this section, "inspection for safety" means an inspection of a rental mobile home that is limited to ensuring the proper functioning, or protection, of the following:</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The age or size of a mobile home shall not be used as the sole basis for refusing to allow an on-site, in-park sale or for refusing to allow the mobile home to remain on-site. The burden of going forward in a suit against the mobile home park owner or operator for violation of this subdivision is on the resident.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The standards incorporated in the written park rules or regulations governing the physical condition and aesthetic characteristics of mobile homes in the mobile home park shall apply equally to all residents.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A mobile home sold on-site shall conform with Act No. 133 of the Public Acts of 1974, being sections 125.771 to 125.774 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   A park owner or operator may charge a reasonable fee to inspect the mobile home before sale. The charge shall not be more than $30.00, or the amount charged for building permit inspections by the municipality in which the mobile home is located, whichever is higher.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The standards governing the physical condition of mobile homes and the aesthetic characteristics of mobile homes in the mobile home park, as incorporated in the written park rules, shall not be designed to defeat the intent of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Subsection (1)(f) shall not apply if the mobile home park is changing its method of doing business and provides not less than 1 year's notice, unless a different notice period is otherwise provided by law, of the proposed change to all affected mobile home park residents. A change in a mobile home park's method of doing business includes, but is not limited to, any of the following: </DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) All of the following apply if an owner named in a certificate of title creates a security interest in the mobile home described in the certificate:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The owner shall immediately execute an application in the form prescribed by the department showing the name and address of the holder of the security interest and deliver the certificate of title, the application, and a copy of the application which need not be signed, to the holder of the security interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The holder of the security interest shall cause the certificate of title, the application, the required fee, and the copy of the application to be mailed or delivered to the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The department shall indicate on the copy of the application the date and place of filing of the application and return the copy to the person presenting it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Upon receipt of the certificate of title, application, and the required fee, the department shall issue a new certificate in the form provided in section 30b, setting forth the name and address of each holder of a security interest in the mobile home for which a termination statement has not been filed and the date on which the application first stating the security interest was filed, and mail the certificate to the owner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A holder of a security interest may assign, absolutely or otherwise, the security interest to a person other than the owner without affecting the interest of the owner or the validity of the security interest, but a person without notice of the assignment is protected in dealing with the holder of the security interest as the holder of the security interest. The assignee may have its interest as the holder of the security interest shown on the certificate of title by providing the department with a copy of the assignment instrument but the failure of the assignee to do so does not affect the validity of the security interest or the assignment of the security interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Receipt by the department of a properly tendered application for a certificate of title on which a security interest in a mobile home is to be indicated, whether the application is tendered under this act, is a condition of perfection of a security interest in the mobile home and is equivalent to filing a financing statement under the uniform commercial code, 1962 PA 174, MCL 440.1101 to 440.11102, with respect to the mobile home. When a security interest in a mobile home is perfected, it has priority over the rights of a lien creditor, as defined in section 9102 of the uniform commercial code, 1962 PA 174, MCL 440.9102.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If there is not an outstanding obligation or commitment to make advances, incur obligations, or otherwise give value, secured or to be secured by a security interest in a mobile home, the secured party shall, within 30 days after satisfaction of the obligation, execute a termination statement in the form prescribed by the department and mail or deliver the termination statement to the owner or other person as the owner may direct. An owner who is not a dealer holding the mobile home for resale shall promptly cause the certificate, all termination statements, and an application for certificate of title to be mailed or delivered to the department. The department shall issue a new certificate.</div>

If the holder of the security interest succeeds to the interest of the owner and holds the mobile home for resale, the holder shall not be required to secure a new certificate of title but, upon transfer to another person, shall promptly mail or deliver to the transferee or to the department the certificate, if in the holder's possession, the affidavit, and other documents required to be sent to the department by the transferee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the interest of the owner in a mobile home is terminated by sale pursuant to a levy of execution, attachment, or other process of a court, the transferee of the owner's interest shall promptly mail or deliver to the department the last certificate of title, if the transferee has possession of it, an application for a new certificate of title in the form prescribed by the department and an affidavit, upon a form prescribed by the department, made by the officer of the court who conducted the sale, setting forth the date of the sale, and the name of the purchaser and whether the officer has delivered the certificate of title to the purchaser and if not, the reason delivery was not made and the then location of the certificate of title so far as known to the officer. </DIV>

Am. 2022, Act 33, Eff. June 13, 2022 <BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> Enacting section 1 of Act 44 of 2003 provides:“Enacting section 1. It is the intent of this legislature that a security interest or lien on a mobile home affixed to real property may be perfected in the manner provided under law for perfecting a lien on real property, and not exclusively by a notation of the security interest or lien on the certificate of title.”</p>
</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>125.2330k Ownership without certificate of title; affidavit of missing title; recording; fees; civil liability.</B><P>Sec. 30k.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Notwithstanding section 30i and subject to subsection (3), if a mobile home is affixed to real property and the party claiming to own the mobile home also owns the real property, and the mobile home has been located on the real property for 15 years or more, but the owner of the mobile home either lost or never received the certificate of title to the mobile home when the owner of the mobile home acquired the real property with the mobile home already affixed to it, the mobile home will be considered affixed to the real property free of any interests that previously attached to the mobile home. The department must approve the affidavit of affixture as submitted if the owner of the mobile home submits to the department an affidavit of missing title that contains all of the following information and pays any fees required under section 30i to issue the affidavit of affixture:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The name and address of the owner of the real property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The address at which the mobile home is physically affixed, if different from the address of the owner of the real property. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A description of the mobile home that includes the name of the manufacturer, the year of manufacture, the model, and the mobile home's or manufacturer's serial number to the extent this information is known to the affiant. An affiant that does not know the manufacturer's serial number must comply with subsection (6) to obtain the serial number, or if applicable, subsection (7) to obtain a replacement serial number.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A statement that the mobile home is affixed to the real property and either of the following pieces of information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Information as may be satisfactory to the department regarding the date that the mobile home was placed on the real property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The date the property assessment or tax roll first reflected that the real property to which the mobile home is affixed was improved with the mobile home. If this subparagraph applies, the owner of the mobile home shall include documentation from the treasurer of the county in which the real property is located that shows proof of the date required under this subparagraph.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A statement that the mobile home and the real property to which it is affixed are not located in a mobile home park.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The legal description and tax parcel number of the real property to which the mobile home is affixed. For purposes of this subdivision, a copy of the vesting deed of the real property must be attached.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) A statement that to the best of the affiant's knowledge, no payments are currently being made to any secured party and no amount is currently owed under any debt obligation that may have previously been secured by the mobile home.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) A statement that the wheels, towing hitches, and running gear of the mobile home have been removed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A statement that the mobile home is attached to a foundation or other support system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Once the affidavit of affixture submitted pursuant to subsection (1) is accepted and approved by the department and subsequently returned to the owner by the department, the owner shall immediately record the executed affidavit of affixture with the register of deeds as required by section 30i.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A secured party that wishes to preserve the secured party's security interest in the mobile home prior to the expiration of the 15-year period that would automatically extinguish the secured party's security interest in the mobile home may preserve the secured party's security interest by complying with the requirements of section 30i(6) and recording notice of the security interest with the register of deeds in the county where the real property is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the owner of a mobile home meets the requirements of subsection (1) and the affidavit of affixture is issued pursuant to this section, the interest of any prior owners of the mobile home is extinguished and title to the mobile home is transferred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The 15-year period under subsection (3) begins when the manufacturer of the mobile home first sells the mobile home or when the tax roll reflects the subject real property as being improved for assessment purposes, whichever is earlier.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If an affiant does not know the manufacturer's serial number as required under subsection (1)(c), the affiant shall provide to the department a completed affidavit of affixture and copies of the recorded deeds in the chain of title for the real property. On receipt of the documents described in this subsection, the department shall review the mobile home records database and if a mobile home title in the database matches the affiant's mobile home on the completed affidavit of affixture, the department shall use the serial number of that mobile home that matches the affiant's mobile home on the completed affidavit of affixture.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If after an examination of the mobile home records database as provided under subsection (6) the department is unable to locate a mobile home title that belongs to any predecessor in title to the real property owned by the affiant, the affiant shall apply for and the department shall provide a replacement serial number for the mobile home. An affiant that complies with this subsection shall submit the completed affidavit of affixture with the replacement serial number received pursuant to this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The affiant shall pay any fees required under subsection (6) to obtain a serial number or subsection (7) to obtain a replacement serial number.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The department is not liable for damages in a civil action for the approval of an affidavit of affixture if the approval is in accordance with this act.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    Upon receipt of a petition supporting an improvement or upon determination of the authority board if a petition is not required under section 18, the authority board, if it desires to proceed with an improvement, shall cause to be prepared plans describing the improvement and the location of the improvement with an estimate of the cost of the improvement on a fixed or periodic basis, as appropriate. Upon receipt of the plans and estimate for an improvement, the authority board shall file a copy of the plans and estimate with the township clerk of each township where the authority district is located. Each such township clerk and the authority board shall keep the plans and estimates on file and available for public examination in their respective offices.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If, after the receipt of the plans and estimate, the authority board desires to proceed with the improvement, the authority board by resolution shall tentatively declare its intention to make the improvement and tentatively designate the special assessment district against which the cost of the improvement is to be assessed.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If periodic redeterminations of cost will be necessary without a change in the special assessment district, that those redeterminations may be made without further notice to record owners or parties in interest in the property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   At the hearing or any adjournment of the hearing, which may be without further notice, the authority board shall hear any objections to the petition supporting the improvement, if such a petition was required, to the improvement, and to the special assessment district. The authority board may then revise the plans, estimate of cost, or special assessment district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Property shall not be added to the special assessment district unless notice is given as provided in section 20 to the record owners of the property in the entire special assessment district, and a hearing is afforded to the record owners. If a petition supporting the improvement is required because property is added to the special assessment district that makes the original petition supporting the improvement insufficient, then a supplemental petition shall be filed containing sufficient additional signatures of record owners.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If, due to the nature of the improvement to be made, a periodic redetermination of costs will be necessary without a change in the special assessment district boundaries, the authority board shall include in its estimate of costs any projected incremental increases. If at any time during the term of the special assessment district an actual incremental cost increase exceeds the estimated incremental cost increase by 10% or more, notice shall be given as provided in section 20 and a hearing afforded to the record owners of property to be assessed.</DIV>

This filing is effective only for the purpose of establishing a record of the names and addresses of those persons entitled to notice of hearings in the special assessment proceedings. The supervisor shall immediately enter on the tax assessment records any changes in the names and addresses of record owners or parties in interest filed with the supervisor and at all times shall keep the tax assessment records current, complete, and available for public inspection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   An authority officer whose duty is to give notice of hearings in special assessment proceedings may rely upon the last township tax assessment records and any filings under subsection (3) in giving notice of the hearing by mail. The method of giving notice by mail as provided in this section is the method that is reasonably certain to inform those to be assessed of the special assessment proceedings. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Failure to give notice as required in this section does not invalidate an entire assessment roll but only the assessment on property affected by the lack of notice. A special assessment is not invalid as to any property if the record owner or the party in interest of that property actually received notice, waived notice, or paid any part of the assessment. If an assessment is declared void by court judgment, a reassessment against the property may be made.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The first installment of a special assessment shall be due on or before the time after confirmation as fixed by the authority board. Subsequent installments are due at intervals of 12 months from the due date of the first installment or from a date fixed by the authority board.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   From the date of confirmation of the roll, special assessments contained in a special assessment roll, including any part of a special assessment deferred as to payment, are a lien upon the respective parcels of land assessed. The lien shall be of the same character and effect as the lien created for township taxes and shall include accrued interest and penalties. A judgment or any act of the authority board vacating a special assessment does not destroy or impair the lien of the authority upon the premises assessed for the amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged against the premises, or as by a regular mode of proceeding might be lawfully assessed on the premises.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) A plan for establishing priority for the relocation of persons displaced by implementation of the plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) Provision for the costs of relocating persons displaced by implementation of the plan, and financial assistance and reimbursement of expenses, including litigation expenses and expenses incident to the transfer of title, in accordance with the uniform relocation assistance and real property acquisition policies act of 1970, Public Law 91-646. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5) and sections 8, 13b(4) and (5), and 13c(12), tax increment revenues related to a brownfield plan must be used only for 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Costs of eligible activities attributable to the eligible property that produces the tax increment revenues. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Eligible activities attributable to any eligible property for property that is owned by or under the control of a land bank fast track authority or a qualified local governmental unit. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A brownfield plan may only authorize the capture of tax increment revenue from eligible property until the year in which the total amount of tax increment revenues captured is equal to the sum of the costs permitted to be funded with tax increment revenues under this act or for not more than 30 years from the beginning date of the capture of the tax increment revenues for that eligible property, whichever occurs first. A brownfield plan may authorize the capture of additional local and school operating tax increment revenue from an eligible property for the local brownfield revolving fund created under section 8 during 1 or more of the following time frames:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If an authority reimburses a person or entity under this section for an advance for the payment or reimbursement of the cost of eligible activities that are not department specific activities and interest thereon included in a combined brownfield plan or a work plan approved by the Michigan strategic fund or the Michigan state housing development authority, or both, as applicable, the authority may capture taxes levied for school operating purposes and local taxes for the payment of that interest if the Michigan strategic fund or the Michigan state housing development authority, as applicable, grants an approval for the capture of taxes levied for school operating purposes to pay that interest. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) An authority may enter into agreements related to these reimbursements and payments described in this section. A reimbursement agreement for these purposes and the obligations under that reimbursement agreement are not subject to section 13 or the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this act, for a brownfield plan that includes the capture of taxes levied for school operating purposes from each eligible property included in a brownfield plan after January 1, 2013, an authority shall pay to the department of treasury at least once annually an amount equal to 50% of the taxes levied under the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, including 50% of that portion of specific taxes attributable to, but not levied under, the state education tax act, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, that are captured under the brownfield plan until the expiration of the earlier of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) The department of treasury shall deposit the amounts described in subsection (14) into the state brownfield redevelopment fund. If an authority makes a payment as required under subsection (14) to the department of treasury, the local taxes levied on that parcel and used to reimburse eligible activities under a brownfield plan must not be increased or decreased due to that payment. If, due to an appeal of any tax assessment, an authority is required to reimburse a taxpayer for any portion of the amount paid to the department of treasury under this subsection, the department of treasury shall reimburse that amount to the authority within 30 days after receiving a request from the authority for reimbursement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) The brownfield plan must include a proposed beginning date of capture. If the actual beginning date of capture of tax increment revenues is later than 5 years following the date of the adoption of the brownfield plan resolution, then the maximum number of years of capture will decrease. The end date of capture must be no later than 35 years after the date of the adoption of the brownfield plan resolution. The authority may amend the beginning date of capture of tax increment revenues for a particular eligible property as long as the authority has not begun to reimburse eligible activities from the capture of tax increment revenues from that eligible property. Any tax increment revenues captured from an eligible property before the beginning date of capture of tax increment revenues for that eligible property must revert proportionately to the respective tax bodies.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>125.2663c Transformational brownfield plan.</B><P>Sec. 13c.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to the approval of the governing body and Michigan strategic fund under section 14a, the board may implement a transformational brownfield plan. The transformational brownfield plan may consist of a single development on eligible property or a series of developments on eligible property that are part of a related program of investment, whether or not located on contiguous parcels, and may be amended to apply to additional parcels of eligible property. Each amendment to a transformational brownfield plan must be approved by the governing body of the municipality in which it is located and the Michigan strategic fund and must be consistent with the approval requirements in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A transformational brownfield plan may authorize the use of construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, tax increment revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues for eligible activities described in section 2(o)(v). Except as otherwise provided in section 13b(6)(d), tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues must be used only for the costs of eligible activities included within the transformational brownfield plan to which the revenues are attributable, including the cost of principal of and interest on any obligation to pay the cost of the eligible activities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A transformational brownfield plan is a brownfield plan and, except as otherwise provided, is subject to sections 13, 13a, 13b, 14, and 15. In addition to the information required under section 13(2), a transformational brownfield plan must contain all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The basis for designating the plan as a transformational brownfield plan under section 2(hhh).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A description of the costs of the transformational brownfield plan intended to be paid for with construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An estimate of the amount of construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues expected to be generated for each year of the transformational brownfield plan from the eligible property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The beginning date and duration of capture of construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues for each eligible property as determined under subsections (8) and (11).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Subject to section 14a(7), the transformational brownfield plan may provide for the use of part or all of the tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues. The portion of tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues to be used may vary over the duration of the transformational brownfield plan, but the portion intended to be used must be clearly stated in the transformational brownfield plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Approval of a transformational brownfield plan, or an amendment to a transformational brownfield plan, must be in accordance with the notice, approval, and public hearing requirements of sections 14 and 14a, except that the governing body shall provide notice to the Michigan strategic fund not less than 30 days before the hearing on a transformational brownfield plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a transformational brownfield plan authorizes the use of construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, or sales and use tax capture revenues, approval of a combined brownfield plan or work plan by the Michigan strategic fund and a written development or reimbursement agreement between the owner or developer of the eligible property, the authority, and the Michigan strategic fund are required. If a plan authorizes the use of tax increment revenues for eligible activities under section 2(o)(v) other than eligible activities described in section 13b, approval of a work plan or combined brownfield plan by the Michigan strategic fund to use tax increment revenues for those additional eligible activities is required. A work plan or combined brownfield plan under this subsection must be consolidated with a work plan or combined brownfield plan under section 13b(4). The eligible activities to be conducted must be consistent with the work plan submitted by the authority to the Michigan strategic fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) On approval of the transformational brownfield plan by the governing body and Michigan strategic fund, and the execution of the written development or reimbursement agreement, the transfer and distribution of construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues as specified in this act and in the plan are binding on this state and the collection and transmission of the amount of tax increment revenues as specified in this act and in the plan are binding on all taxing units levying ad valorem property taxes or specific taxes against property subject to the transformational brownfield plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A transformational brownfield plan must not authorize the capture or use of tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, or sales and use tax capture revenues after the year in which the total amount of the revenue captured under the transformational brownfield plan is equal to the sum of the costs permitted to be funded with the revenue under the transformational brownfield plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The brownfield authority and Michigan strategic fund may reimburse advances, with or without interest, made by a municipality under section 7(3), a land bank fast track authority, or any other person or entity for costs of eligible activities included within a transformational brownfield plan using tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, or sales and use tax capture revenues attributable to that plan. On approval of the Michigan strategic fund, the amount of tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues authorized to be captured under a transformational brownfield plan may include amounts required for the payment of interest under this subsection. A written development or reimbursement agreement must be entered into under subsection (6) before any reimbursement or payment using tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, or sales and use tax capture revenues may commence. A reimbursement agreement for these purposes and the obligations under that reimbursement agreement are not subject to section 12 or the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Eligible activities conducted on eligible property before approval of the transformational brownfield plan may be reimbursed from tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues if those costs and the eligible property are subsequently included in a transformational brownfield plan approved by the governing body and Michigan strategic fund, a combined brownfield plan or work plan approved by the Michigan strategic fund, and a written development or reimbursement agreement under subsection (6). Reimbursement under this subsection is limited to eligible expenses incurred within 90 days of the approval of the transformational brownfield plan by the Michigan strategic fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The duration of the capture of withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues under a transformational brownfield plan for a particular eligible property must not exceed the lesser of the period authorized under subsection (8) or 20 years from the beginning date of the capture of withholding tax capture revenues income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues for that eligible property. The beginning date for the capture of tax increment revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues for an eligible property must not be later than 5 years following the date the Michigan strategic fund approves the inclusion of the eligible property in a transformational brownfield plan. Subject to the approval of the governing body and Michigan strategic fund, the authority may amend the beginning date of capture of tax increment revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues to a date not later than 5 years following the date the Michigan strategic fund approved inclusion of the eligible property in the transformational brownfield plan if capture of the revenues under the transformational brownfield plan has not yet commenced. Solely with respect to a related program of investment as defined in subsection (12), subject to the approval of the governing body and Michigan strategic fund, the authority may amend the beginning date of capture of tax increment revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues for an eligible property included within a related program of investment to a date later than 5 years following the date the Michigan strategic fund approved inclusion of the eligible property in the transformational brownfield plan if the governing body and Michigan strategic fund determine that the developer of the related program of investment has proceeded in good faith and made reasonable and substantial progress in the implementation of the related program of investment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) For purposes of subsection (1), a series of developments on parcels that are not contiguous is considered a related program of investment if all of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The developments are proposed to be undertaken concurrently or in reasonable succession.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For developments under affiliated ownership, the developments are reasonably contiguous and are part of a program of investment in a logically defined geography, including, but not limited to, a downtown district as defined in section 201 of the recodified tax increment financing act, 2018 PA 57, MCL 125.4201, or a principal shopping district or business improvement district as defined in section 1 of 1961 PA 120, MCL 125.981, and including areas that are logically related to those districts and that will promote infill development.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For developments under unrelated ownership, in addition to the criteria described in subdivisions (a) and (b), the developments are part of a master development plan, area plan, sub-area plan, or similar development plan that has been approved or adopted by resolution of the governing body.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The designation of the developments as a related program of investment is consistent with the purposes of this act and is not a combination of unrelated or minimally related projects calculated to meet the minimum investment threshold.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) If undeveloped property included in a transformational brownfield plan has been designated as a renaissance zone under the Michigan renaissance zone act, 1996 PA 376, MCL 125.2681 to 125.2696, on the request of the owner or developer of the eligible property and the local governmental unit that designated the zone, the Michigan strategic fund, and a city levying a tax under the city income tax act, 1964 PA 284, MCL 141.501 to 141.787, may elect under section 9(4) of the Michigan renaissance zone act, 1996 PA 376, MCL 125.2689, to terminate the exemptions, deductions, or credits provided for in section 9(1)(b) and (c) of that act, and reimburse the authority, or owner or developer of the eligible property, an annual amount equal to the revenue collected for each tax year as a result of the termination of the exemptions, deductions, or credits that would otherwise be in effect. In implementing this subsection, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The authority and Michigan strategic fund shall include amounts anticipated to be collected under this subsection in the income tax capture revenues authorized to be used under the transformational brownfield plan and associated work plan or combined brownfield plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The state treasurer shall calculate for each tax year the amount of revenue this state collected as a result of the operation of this subsection and shall deposit that amount as income tax capture revenues into the state brownfield redevelopment fund, where the funds must be transmitted in the manner provided for in sections 8a(4) and 16(8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A city levying a city income tax under the city income tax act, 1964 PA 284, MCL 141.501 to 141.787, shall calculate for each tax year the amount of revenue the city collected as a result of the operation of this subsection and shall enter into a binding reimbursement agreement with the authority, and owner or developer of the eligible property, providing for the payment of the amounts to the authority, or the owner or developer of the eligible property, for eligible activities as provided in the transformational brownfield plan. City income taxes administered by the department of treasury pursuant to the city income tax act, 1964 PA 284, MCL 141.501 to 141.787, are subject to the procedures of subdivision (b) regarding the calculation and deposit of any revenue collected as a result of the operation of this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The department of treasury may require the owner or developer to submit any information necessary for the calculation of revenue collected pursuant to the operation of this subsection. This state has no obligation for calculating revenues to be collected pursuant to the operation of this subsection if the required information is not reported.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) The authority and governing body are solely responsible for deciding whether to seek approval of a brownfield plan as a transformational brownfield plan. Nothing in this section or section 14a operates to prejudice or limit consideration of a brownfield plan under sections 13 and 14, including a decision by the Michigan strategic fund not to approve a plan as a transformational brownfield plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) This act does not preclude an authority established by a county from seeking approval of a brownfield plan as a transformational brownfield plan. In the event that an authority established by a county seeks approval of a plan that extends into more than 1 of its component local units of government and that plan includes eligible property in more than 1 municipality that is not a county, the minimum investment requirements of section 2(hhh) must be established with reference to combined population of the municipalities that are not a county in which the eligible property is located.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A statement that maps, plats, and a description of the brownfield plan are available for public inspection at a place designated in the notice and that all aspects of the brownfield plan are open for discussion at the public hearing required by this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Any other information that the governing body considers appropriate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) At the time set for the hearing on the brownfield plan required under subsection (1), the governing body shall ensure that interested persons have an opportunity to be heard and that written communications with reference to the brownfield plan are received and considered. The governing body shall ensure that a record of the public hearing is made and preserved, including all data presented at the hearing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Not less than 10 days before the hearing on the brownfield plan, the governing body shall provide notice of the hearing to the taxing jurisdictions that levy taxes subject to capture under this act. The authority shall notify the taxing jurisdictions of the proposed brownfield plan. At that hearing, an official from a taxing jurisdiction with millage that would be subject to capture under this act has the right to be heard in regard to the adoption of the brownfield plan. Not less than 10 days before the hearing on the brownfield plan, the governing body shall provide notice of the hearing to the department if the brownfield plan involves the use of taxes levied for school operating purposes to pay for eligible activities that require the approval of a combined brownfield plan or a work plan by the department under section 13b(6)(c), the Michigan state housing development authority, or its designee, if the brownfield plan involves the use of taxes levied for school operating purposes to pay for eligible activities subject to 13b(4)(b), and the Michigan strategic fund, or its designee, if the brownfield plan involves the use of taxes levied for school operating purposes to pay for eligible activities subject to section 13b(4) other than eligible activities subject to 13b(4)(b).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Except as provided in this subsection, amendments to an approved brownfield plan must be submitted by the authority to the governing body for approval or rejection following the same notice necessary for approval or rejection of the original plan. Notice is not required for revisions in the estimates of captured taxable value or tax increment revenues.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The procedure, adequacy of notice, and findings with respect to purpose and captured taxable value are presumptively valid unless contested in a court of competent jurisdiction within 60 days after adoption of the resolution adopting the brownfield plan. An amendment, adopted by resolution, to a conclusive plan is likewise conclusive unless contested within 60 days after adoption of the resolution adopting the amendment. If a resolution adopting an amendment to the plan is contested, the original resolution adopting the plan is not therefore open to contest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A brownfield plan or plan amendment may be abolished or terminated according to this subsection subject to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The governing body may abolish a brownfield plan if it finds that the purposes for which the plan was established are accomplished.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The governing body may terminate a brownfield plan or plan amendment for an eligible property if the project for which eligible activities were identified in the brownfield plan or plan amendment fails to occur with respect to the eligible property for not less than 2 years following the date of the resolution approving the brownfield plan or plan amendment, if the governing body first does both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Gives 30 days' prior written notice to the developer at its last known address by certified mail or other method that documents proof of delivery attempted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Provides the developer an opportunity to be heard at a public meeting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If a brownfield plan or plan amendment is terminated under subdivision (b), the governing body may approve a new brownfield plan or plan amendment for the eligible property under which tax increment revenues may be captured for up to the period of time provided under section 13(5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Notwithstanding anything in this subsection to the contrary, a brownfield plan or plan amendment must not be abolished or terminated until the principal and interest on bonds issued under section 17 and all other obligations to which the tax increment revenues are pledged have been paid or funds sufficient to make the payment have been identified or segregated.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The governing body and Michigan strategic fund shall determine whether to approve a transformational brownfield plan in accordance with this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The governing body shall make an initial determination as to whether the transformational brownfield plan constitutes a public purpose in accordance with section 14(5). If the governing body determines the transformational brownfield plan does not constitute a public purpose, it shall reject the transformational brownfield plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the governing body determines that the transformational brownfield plan constitutes a public purpose, the governing body may then approve or reject the transformational brownfield plan, or approve it with modification, by resolution based on all of the following considerations:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Whether the transformational brownfield plan meets the requirements of section 2(hhh), which must include a determination that the transformational brownfield plan is calculated to, and has the reasonable likelihood to, have a transformational impact on local economic development and community revitalization based on the extent of brownfield redevelopment and growth in population, commercial activity, and employment that will result from the transformational brownfield plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Whether the transformational brownfield plan meets the requirements of sections 13, 13b, and 13c.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Whether the costs of eligible activities proposed are reasonable and necessary to carry out the purposes of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Whether the amount of captured taxable value, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues estimated to result from adoption of the transformational brownfield plan are reasonable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Whether the transformational brownfield plan takes into account the criteria described in section 90b(4) of the Michigan strategic fund act, 1984 PA 270, MCL 125.2090b.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Whether subject to subsection (22)(d), the transformational brownfield plan includes provisions for affordable housing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Within 90 days of the completion of an administratively complete application and the analysis required under subsection (5), the Michigan strategic fund shall approve or reject the transformational brownfield plan, or approve it with modification, by resolution based on the criteria in subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) In determining whether to approve a transformational brownfield plan under subsection (3)(c) and (d), the Michigan strategic fund shall conduct a financial and underwriting analysis of the developments included in the plan. The analysis must consider both projected rental rates at the time of project delivery and potential increases in rental rates over time. The Michigan strategic fund shall not approve the use of construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues beyond the amount determined to be necessary for the project to be economically viable. The Michigan strategic fund shall develop standardized underwriting criteria for determining economic viability. The Michigan strategic fund shall take into account the impact of the sales and use tax exemptions under section 4d(n) of the general sales tax act, 1933 PA 167, MCL 205.54d, and section 4dd of the use tax act, 1937 PA 94, MCL 205.94dd, in determining the amount of construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues required for the project to be economically viable. The Michigan strategic fund shall ensure that each transformational brownfield plan includes a significant equity contribution from the owner or developer as determined by the fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The Michigan strategic fund shall require an independent, third-party underwriting analysis under subsection (3)(d) for any plan that proposes to use more than $10,000,000.00 in any year in withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues, as determined by the first full year of tax capture under the plan. The cost of the independent, third-party underwriting analysis must be paid by the owner or developer of the eligible property. In addition to the independent, third-party underwriting analysis, the Michigan strategic fund shall require an independent, third-party analysis of the sales and use tax capture revenue estimates for any plan that includes sales and use tax capture revenues. The cost of the independent, third-party analysis must be paid by the owner or developer of the eligible property. The Michigan strategic fund shall consult with the state treasurer before approving any transformational brownfield plan subject to this subsection. This subsection does not limit the ability of the Michigan strategic fund to utilize independent, third-party analyses on plans not subject to this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Michigan strategic fund may not approve a transformational brownfield plan that proposes to use more than 50% of the withholding tax capture revenues or 50% of the income tax capture revenues. The Michigan strategic fund may modify the amount of withholding tax capture revenues and income tax capture revenues before approving a transformational brownfield plan to bring the transformational brownfield plan into compliance with subsection (5). The Michigan strategic fund may approve a transformational brownfield plan that proposes to use more than 50% of the income tax capture revenues if 1 of the following applies:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The income tax capture revenues are attributable to the election under section 13c(13).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The applicable eligible properties within the transformational brownfield plan are subject to a written, binding affordable housing agreement with the local governmental unit, which agreement must be provided to the Michigan strategic fund, in which case the Michigan strategic fund may approve a transformational brownfield plan that proposes to use up to 100% of the income tax capture revenues, subject to the underwriting and financial analysis required under subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The Michigan strategic fund shall require the owner or developer of the eligible property to certify the actual capital investment, as determined in accordance with section 2(o)(v) and (hhh), on the completion of construction and before the commencement of reimbursement from withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, sales and use tax capture revenues, or tax increment revenues, for the plan or the distinct phase or project within the plan for which reimbursement will be provided. If the actual capital investment is less than the amount included in the plan, the Michigan strategic fund shall review the determination under subsection (5) and may modify the amount of reimbursement if, and to the extent, such a modification is necessary to maintain compliance with subsection (5). The transformational brownfield plan, work plan, and development and reimbursement agreement must include provisions to enforce the requirements and remedies under this subsection. If the actual level of capital investment does not meet the applicable minimum investment requirement under section 2(hhh) and is outside of the safe harbor under subsection (15), the Michigan strategic fund may take 1 of the following remedial actions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For a plan that consists of a single development, reduce the amount of reimbursement under the plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For a plan that consists of distinct phases or projects, if the failure to meet the minimum investment threshold is the result of failure to undertake additional distinct phases or projects as provided for in the plan, 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Permanently rescind the authorization to use tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues for the additional distinct phases or projects in the plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the Michigan strategic fund determines that the applicable owner or developer acted in bad faith, reduce the amount of reimbursement for completed phases of the plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) On approval by the Michigan strategic fund, the minimum investment requirements in section 2(hhh) and limitation under subsection (22)(a) and (b) may be waived if the transformational brownfield plan meets 1 of the following criteria:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Is for eligible property in an area approved by the Michigan state housing development authority as eligible for blight elimination program funding under the housing finance agency innovation fund for the hardest hit housing markets authorized pursuant to the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008, division A of Public Law 110-343, 12 USC 5201 to 5261. For purposes of this subdivision, an area approved as eligible for blight elimination program funding means that specific portion or portions of a municipality where the Michigan state housing development authority approved the expenditure of blight elimination program funds pursuant to an application identifying the target areas.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Is for eligible property in a municipality that was subject to a state of emergency under the emergency management act, 1976 PA 390, MCL 30.401 to 30.421, issued for drinking water contamination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Is for eligible property that is a historic resource if the Michigan strategic fund determines the redevelopment is not economically feasible absent the transformational brownfield plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Is for eligible property that is located in a city, village, or township with a population of less than 25,000 or that is otherwise eligible for the corresponding population tier in section 2(hhh)(vi), as determined in accordance with subsection (15), if the Michigan strategic fund determines that the redevelopment is not economically feasible absent the transformational brownfield plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) In determining whether a plan under subsection (9) has a transformational impact for purposes of section 2(hhh) and subsection (3)(a), the governing body and Michigan strategic fund shall consider the impact of the transformational brownfield plan in relation to existing investment and development conditions in the project area and whether the transformational brownfield plan will act as a catalyst for additional revitalization of the area in which it is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The Michigan strategic fund may not approve more than 5 transformational brownfield plans under subsection (9) in a calendar year, except that if the Michigan strategic fund approves fewer than 5 plans in a calendar year under subsection (9), the unused approval authority carries forward into future calendar years and remains available until December 31, 2027. The Michigan strategic fund also shall not approve more than 5 transformational brownfield plans under subsection (9) in any individual city, village, or township before December 31, 2022.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, amendments to an approved transformational brownfield plan must be submitted by the authority to the governing body and to the Michigan strategic fund for approval or rejection following the same notice necessary for approval or rejection of the original transformational brownfield plan. Notice is not required for revisions in the estimates of tax increment revenues, construction period tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, income tax capture revenues, or sales and use tax capture revenues.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Except as provided in this subsection, an amendment to an approved transformational brownfield plan under section 13c(1) is not considered a new plan approval subject to the limitation in subsection (22)(a). The Michigan strategic fund may consider an amendment as a new plan approval only if the amendment adds eligible property and the Michigan strategic fund determines that approving the addition as an amendment would be inconsistent with the purposes of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) The procedure, adequacy of notice, and findings under this section are presumptively valid unless contested in a court of competent jurisdiction within 60 days after approval of the transformational brownfield plan by the Michigan strategic fund. An approved amendment to a conclusive transformational brownfield plan is likewise conclusive unless contested within 60 days after approval of the amendment by the Michigan strategic fund. If a resolution adopting an amendment to the transformational brownfield plan is contested, the original resolution adopting the transformational brownfield plan is not open to contest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) The determination as to whether a transformational brownfield plan complies with the minimum investment requirements in section 2(hhh) must be made with reference to the most recent decennial census data available at the time of approval by the authority. A plan in a municipality that exceeds a population tier under section 2(hhh) by not more than 10% of the maximum population for that tier is, on election of the authority, subject to the investment requirement for that tier. A transformational brownfield plan that is expected to result in, or does result in, a total capital investment that is within 10% of the applicable minimum investment requirement is considered to satisfy the applicable requirement under section 2(hhh).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) For purposes of a transformational brownfield plan, determination as to whether property is functionally obsolete may include considerations of economic obsolescence as determined in accordance with the Michigan state tax commission's assessor's manual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) Any positive or negative determination by the Michigan strategic fund under this section must be supported by objective analysis and documented in the record of its proceedings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) The Michigan strategic fund shall charge and collect a reasonable application fee as necessary to cover the costs associated with the review and approval of a transformational brownfield plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) The Michigan strategic fund shall not commit, and the department of treasury shall not disburse, more than $80,000,000.00 in total annual tax capture. As used in this subsection, "total annual tax capture" means the total annual amount of income tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues that may be reimbursed each calendar year under all transformational brownfield plans. In addition to the $80,000,000.00 annual limit, both of the following provisions apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) With respect to the availability of uncommitted amounts, if an amount authorized to be committed for a calendar year has not been committed, the uncommitted amount for that calendar year remains available to be committed and disbursed in a subsequent calendar year and is in addition to the annual limits otherwise applicable. However, not more than $30,000,000.00 may be committed or disbursed in any calendar year above the $80,000,000.00 annual limit as a result of the operation of this subdivision, and all commitments and disbursements under this subdivision remain subject to the overall limitation in subsection (20).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) With respect to the availability of committed but undisbursed amounts, if an amount has been committed under an approved transformational brownfield plan for a calendar year but has not been disbursed, the undisbursed amount for that year is available to be disbursed in a subsequent calendar year and is in addition to the annual limit otherwise applicable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) The Michigan strategic fund shall not commit, and the department of treasury shall not disburse, a total amount of income tax capture revenues, withholding tax capture revenues, and sales and use tax capture revenues that exceeds $1,600,000,000.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) The Michigan strategic fund shall not approve more than a total of $200,000,000.00 in construction period tax capture revenues. The Michigan strategic fund shall project the value of the sales and use tax exemptions under each transformational brownfield plan at the time of plan approval and shall require such information from the owner or developer as is necessary to perform this calculation. The Michigan strategic fund also shall require the owner or developer of the eligible property to report the actual value of the sales and use tax exemptions each tax year of the construction period and at the end of the construction period. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) The Michigan strategic fund shall comply with all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Not approve more than 5 transformational brownfield plans in a calendar year, except that if the Michigan strategic fund approves fewer than 5 plans in a calendar year, the unused approval authority carries forward into future calendar years and remains available until December 31, 2027.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Not approve more than 5 transformational brownfield plans in any individual city, village, or township before December 31, 2022.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Ensure an equitable geographic distribution of plans approved under this subsection, which must achieve a balance between the needs of municipalities of differing sizes and differing geographic areas of the state. Subject to the receipt of qualified transformational brownfield plans meeting the criteria under this section and section 13c, the Michigan strategic fund shall ensure that both of the following requirements are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Not less than 33% and not more than 38% of the total transformational brownfield plans approved under this act before December 31, 2027 will be located in cities, villages, and townships with a population of less than 100,000.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Not less than 33% and not more than 38% of the total transformational brownfield plans approved under this act before December 31, 2027 will be located in cities, villages, and townships with a population of not less than 100,000 and not more than 225,000.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) In coordination with the governing body, shall determine the appropriate provisions regarding affordable housing on a plan-by-plan basis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(23) In the event of a proposed change in ownership of eligible property subject to a transformational brownfield plan for which reimbursement will continue, the approval of the Michigan strategic fund is required before the assignment or transfer of the development and reimbursement agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(24) If the Michigan strategic fund approves a transformational brownfield plan and work plan, and subsequent to that approval, amendments are made to this act, the Michigan strategic fund may amend those plans to make conforming and consistent changes to the approved transformational brownfield plan and work plan on an administrative basis, if those changes do not result in any increase in the aggregate total amount of reimbursement authorized under the initial transformational brownfield plan. The authority of the Michigan strategic fund to administratively amend transformational brownfield plans and work plans under this subsection also applies to transformational brownfield plans and work plans entered into before December 27, 2021.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(25) The Michigan strategic fund shall not approve any new transformational brownfield plans after December 31, 2027. A transformational brownfield plan approved before December 31, 2022 remains in effect and may be amended in accordance with this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(26) On approval by the Michigan strategic fund, the mixed-use requirement in section 2(hhh) may be waived for a brownfield plan that otherwise meets the location, population, and minimum investment requirement under section 2(hhh)(vi).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) To seek department approval of a work plan under section 13b(6)(c), the authority shall submit all of the following for each eligible property:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A copy of the brownfield plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Current ownership information for each eligible property and a summary of available information on proposed future ownership, including the amount of any delinquent taxes, interest, and penalties that may be due.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A summary of available information on the historical and current use of each eligible property, including a brief summary of site conditions and what is known about environmental contamination as that term is defined in section 20101 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.20101.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Existing and proposed future zoning for each eligible property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A brief summary of the proposed redevelopment and future use for each eligible property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) On receipt of a request for approval of a work plan under subsection (1) or a portion of a work plan that pertains to only department specific activities, the department shall review the work plan according to subsection (3) and provide 1 of the following written responses to the requesting authority within 60 days:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An unconditional approval.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A conditional approval that delineates specific necessary modifications to the work plan to meet the criteria of subsection (3), including, but not limited to, individual activities to be modified, added, or deleted from the work plan and revision of costs. The department may not condition its approval on deletions from or modifications of the work plan relating to activities to be funded solely by tax increment revenues not attributable to taxes levied for school operating purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the work plan lacks sufficient information for the department to respond under subdivision (a), (b), or (d) for any specific activity, a letter stating with specificity the necessary additions or changes to the work plan to be submitted before that activity will be considered by the department. The department shall respond under subdivision (a), (b), or (d) according to this section for the other activities in the work plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A denial if the property is not an eligible property under this act, if the work plan contemplates the use of taxes levied for school operating purposes prohibited by section 13b(10), or for any specific activity if the activity is prohibited by section 13b(6)(a). The department may also deny any activity in a work plan that does not meet the conditions in subsection (3) only if the department cannot respond under subdivision (b) or (c). The department shall accompany the denial with a letter that states with specificity the reason for the denial. The department shall respond under subdivision (a), (b), or (c) according to this section for any activities in the work plan that are not denied under this subdivision. If the department denies all or a portion of a work plan under this subdivision, the authority may subsequently resubmit the work plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The department may approve a work plan if the following conditions have been met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Whether some or all of the activities constitute department specific activities other than activities that are exempt from the work plan approval process under section 13b(8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The department specific activities, other than the activities that are exempt from the work plan approval process under section 13b(8), are protective of the public health, safety, and welfare and the environment. The department may approve department specific activities that are more protective of the public health, safety, and welfare and the environment than required by section 20107a of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.20107a, if those activities provide public health or environmental benefit. In review of a work plan that includes department specific activities that are more protective of the public health, safety, and welfare and the environment, the department's considerations may include, but are not limited to, all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Proposed new land use and reliability of restrictions to prevent exposure to contamination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The cost to implement activities minimally necessary to achieve due care compliance, the total cost of response activities, and the incremental cost of department specific activities in excess of those activities minimally necessary to achieve due care compliance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Long-term obligations associated with leaving contamination in place and the value of reducing or eliminating these obligations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The estimated costs for the activities as a whole are reasonable for the stated purpose. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b), the department shall make the determination in this subdivision only after the department determines that the conditions in subdivisions (a) and (b) have been met.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the department fails to provide a written response under subsection (2) within 60 days after receipt of a request for approval of a work plan, the authority may proceed with the activities as outlined in the work plan as submitted for approval. Except as provided in subsection (5), activities conducted pursuant to a work plan that was submitted to the department for approval but for which the department failed to provide a written response under subsection (2) are considered approved for the purposes of subsection (1). Within 45 days after receiving additional information requested from the authority under subsection (2)(c), the department shall review the additional information according to subsection (3) and provide 1 of the responses described in subsection (2) to the requesting authority for the specific activity. If the department does not provide a response to the requesting authority within 45 days after receiving the additional information requested under subsection (2)(c), the activity is approved under section 13b.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The department may issue a written response to a work plan more than 60 days but less than 6 months after receipt of a request for approval. If the department issues a written response under this subsection, the authority is not required to conduct individual activities that are in addition to the individual activities included in the work plan as it was submitted for approval and failure to conduct these additional activities does not affect the authority's ability to capture taxes under section 13b for the eligible activities described in the work plan initially submitted under subsection (4). In addition, at the option of the authority, these additional individual activities are considered part of the work plan of the authority and approved for purposes of section 13b. However, any response by the department under this subsection that identifies additional individual activities that must be carried out to satisfy part 201 or part 213 must be satisfactorily completed for the activities to be considered acceptable for the purposes of compliance with part 201 or part 213.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the department issues a written response under subsection (5) to a work plan and if the department's written response modifies an individual activity proposed by the work plan of the authority in a manner that reduces or eliminates a proposed response activity, the authority must complete those individual activities in accordance with the department's response in order for that portion of the work plan to be considered approved for purposes of section 13b, unless 1 or more of the following conditions apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Obligations for the individual activity have been issued by the authority, or by a municipality on behalf of the authority, to fund the individual activity before issuance of the department's response.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The individual activity has commenced or payment for the work has been irrevocably obligated before issuance of the department's response.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) It is in the sole discretion of an authority to propose to undertake department specific activities under subsection (3)(b) at an eligible property under a brownfield plan. The department shall not require a work plan to include department specific activities that are more protective of public health, safety, welfare, and the environment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The department shall review the portion of a work plan that includes department specific activities in accordance with subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The department's approval or denial of a work plan submitted under this section constitutes a final decision in regard to the use of taxes levied for school operating purposes but does not restrict an authority's use of tax increment revenues attributable to local taxes to pay for eligible activities under a brownfield plan. If a person is aggrieved by the final decision, the person may appeal under section 631 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.631.</div>

The bill presented to the Governor on July 17, 1996, did not accurately reflect what was agreed to by both houses of the Legislature. Specifically, Section 17, subsection (1), the third sentence incorrectly stated:'The terms of the municipal finance act, Act No. 202 of the Public Acts of 1943, apply to bonds issued under this section.'The sentence agreed to by both houses is:'Except for the requirement of the municipal finance act, Act No. 202 of the Public Acts of 1943, being sections 131.1 to 139.3 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, that the authority receive the approval or an exception from approval from the department of treasury prior to the issuance of bonds under this subsection, the terms of Act No. 202 of the Public Acts of 1943 shall not apply to bonds issued under this section.'Therefore, we are presenting a correct Enrolled Senate Bill 923 for your signature and filing with the Secretary of State. Upon filing, the defective Enrolled Senate Bill 923 will be replaced with the correct Enrolled Senate Bill 923 and assigned the same public act number. The effective date of the Public Act No. 381 of 1996 will be the date the correct bill is filed.This procedure ensures the integrity of the process while providing notification to the public.

A resolution provided by a city, village, or township under section 7(2) does not constitute an application of a city, village, or township for a renaissance zone under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For a distinct geographic area described in subsection (1)(d), a village may include publicly owned land within the boundaries of any distinct geographic area.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Beginning December 1, 2006 through December 31, 2011, a qualified local governmental unit or units in which a renaissance zone was designated under section 8 or 8a(1) or (3) may designate additional distinct geographic areas not to exceed a total of 10 distinct geographic areas upon application to and approval by the board of the Michigan strategic fund if the distinct geographic area is located in an eligible distressed area as defined in section 11 of the state housing development authority act of 1966, 1966 PA 346, MCL 125.1411, or is contiguous to an eligible distressed area, and if the additional distinct geographic area will increase capital investment or job creation.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Through December 31, 2002, if a qualified local governmental unit or units designate additional distinct geographic areas in a renaissance zone under subsection (4), the qualified local governmental unit or units may extend the duration of the renaissance zone status of 1 or more distinct geographic areas in that renaissance zone until 2017 upon application to and approval by the board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Through December 31, 2002, a qualified local governmental unit or units in which a renaissance zone was designated under section 8 or 8a may, upon application to and approval by the board, seek to extend the duration of renaissance zone status until 2017. Upon application, the board may extend the duration of renaissance zone status. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Through December 31, 2011, a qualified local governmental unit or units in which a renaissance zone was designated under section 8 or 8a(1) or (3) may, upon application to and approval by the board of the Michigan strategic fund, seek to extend the duration of renaissance zone status for 1 or more portions of the renaissance zone if that zone or portion of a zone is in existence as of March 15, 2008, if the extension will increase capital investment or job creation, and the county in which the portion or portions of the renaissance zone are located consents to extend the duration of renaissance zone status. The board of the Michigan strategic fund may extend renaissance zone status for 1 or more portions of the renaissance zone under this subsection for a period of time not to exceed 15 years from the date of the application to the board of the Michigan strategic fund under this subsection. However, beginning on April 29, 2008, if the board of the Michigan strategic fund extends the duration of 1 or more portions of a renaissance zone under this subsection, the board of the Michigan strategic fund may revoke that extension if the board determines that increased capital investment or job creation will not begin within 1 year of the granting of the extension or otherwise violates the terms of the written development agreement between the owner of the real property and the board of the Michigan strategic fund. Only the qualified local governmental unit that is requesting the extension of time may submit the application. If the board of the Michigan strategic fund extends the duration of 1 or more portions of a renaissance zone, the board of the Michigan strategic fund shall enter into a written development agreement with the owner of all real property located within the boundaries of the portions of the renaissance zone whose duration has been extended. The written development agreement shall include, but is not limited to, all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The duration of the extension.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The conditions under which the extension is granted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The amount of capital investment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The number of jobs to be created.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Any other conditions or requirements reasonably required by the board of the Michigan strategic fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a qualified local governmental unit in which a renaissance zone was designated under section 8 received approval by the Michigan strategic fund to extend the duration of renaissance zone status under subsection (7) for a period of 7 years and that renaissance zone is located in a county with a population of more than 190,000 and less than 240,000 according to the most recent decennial census, that qualified local governmental unit may resubmit an application to the Michigan strategic fund before June 30, 2014 to extend the duration of renaissance zone status for an additional 8 years, not to exceed 15 years' total extension. The Michigan strategic fund may grant the extension if the extension shall increase capital investment or job creation in this state and the owner and project developer are in compliance with the written agreement described in subsection (7).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The board of the Michigan strategic fund described in section 4 of the Michigan strategic fund act, 1984 PA 270, MCL 125.2004, upon the application of a next Michigan development corporation, may designate next Michigan renaissance zones for eligible next Michigan businesses within the boundaries of a next Michigan development district. The number of next Michigan renaissance zones to be designated for a next Michigan development district that does not include an eligible urban entity as defined in the next Michigan development act shall equal the cumulative number of initial or subsequent local governmental unit parties to the next Michigan development corporation interlocal agreement, plus 1 additional next Michigan renaissance zone for each county party to the interlocal agreement, but shall not exceed 12 for each next Michigan development district. The number of next Michigan renaissance zones to be designated for a next Michigan development district that includes an eligible urban entity as defined in the next Michigan development act shall not exceed 12 as determined by the president of the Michigan strategic fund. The number shall not be reduced on account of a reduction in the number of local government unit parties to the interlocal agreement from time to time. The next Michigan development corporation shall make recommendations to the board of the Michigan strategic fund as to which areas shall be designated as next Michigan renaissance zones for eligible next Michigan businesses under this act. The aggregate territory of all next Michigan renaissance zones designated for a next Michigan development corporation shall not exceed the lesser of 200 acres times the number of next Michigan renaissance zones designated for a next Michigan development corporation or 1,675 acres. A next Michigan renaissance zone shall have a duration of renaissance zone status for a period of not less than 5 years and not more than 10 years as determined by the board of the Michigan strategic fund. Except as otherwise provided in this act, if the board of the Michigan strategic fund determines that the duration of renaissance zone status for a next Michigan renaissance zone is less than 10 years, then the board of the Michigan strategic fund, with the consent of the next Michigan development corporation and with the consent of the city, village, or township in which the next Michigan renaissance zone is located, may extend the duration of renaissance zone status for the next Michigan renaissance zone for 1 or more periods that when combined do not exceed 10 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The next Michigan development corporation shall make recommendations to the board of the Michigan strategic fund to certify an eligible next Michigan business as a qualified eligible next Michigan business entitled to the exemptions, deductions, or credits as provided in section 9. Upon the recommendation of a next Michigan development corporation and subject to subsection (10), the board of the Michigan strategic fund may determine whether an eligible next Michigan business should receive the benefits of a renaissance zone and certify that eligible next Michigan business as a qualified eligible next Michigan business under this act and subject to a written agreement as provided in subsection (8). The board of the Michigan strategic fund shall establish a standard process to evaluate applications for certification as a qualified eligible next Michigan business and shall appoint a committee to review the applications. The standard application process developed by the board of the Michigan strategic fund shall be approved by a resolution of the board of the Michigan strategic fund before an eligible next Michigan business is certified as a qualified eligible next Michigan business. The board of the Michigan strategic fund shall certify or deny the application to certify an eligible next Michigan business as a qualified eligible next Michigan business within 49 days of receipt of the application that is complete in all material respects as determined by the president of the Michigan strategic fund. If the board of the Michigan strategic fund fails to certify or deny the application for certification within 49 days of receipt of the application that is complete in all material respects as determined by the president of the Michigan strategic fund, the application for certification is considered approved. If the board of the Michigan strategic fund denies the application for certification, the applicant may appeal that denial to the board of the Michigan strategic fund for reconsideration. The president of the Michigan strategic fund shall notify the next Michigan development corporation that the Michigan strategic fund has certified a qualified eligible next Michigan business in a next Michigan development district. The next Michigan development corporation shall develop an application process for eligible next Michigan businesses, which process shall be approved by the board of the Michigan strategic fund. A next Michigan development corporation shall not use the incentives provided in this act primarily to recruit an eligible next Michigan business to relocate from a location in this state to another location in this state. A next Michigan development corporation shall not recommend and the board of the Michigan strategic fund shall not certify an eligible next Michigan business as a qualified eligible next Michigan business unless that eligible next Michigan business opens a new location in this state, locates in this state, or is an existing business located in this state that will materially expand its business in this state as determined by the board of the Michigan strategic fund. However, the board of the Michigan strategic fund shall not certify an eligible next Michigan business as a qualified eligible next Michigan business if the principal economic effect of the expansion or location of the eligible next Michigan business into a next Michigan development district is the transfer of employment from 1 or more cities, villages, or townships in this state to the next Michigan development district and each order or resolution certifying an eligible next Michigan business as a qualified eligible next Michigan business shall contain an express finding, based upon competent and material evidence in the record, of compliance with the requirements of this subsection. Any transfer of employment from 1 or more cities, villages, and townships in this state to a next Michigan development district resulting from the expansion or location of an eligible next Michigan business into a next Michigan development district in which the aggregate number of transferred full-time employees is less than 15% of the total number of full-time employees proposed to be located in the next Michigan development district by the eligible next Michigan business shall be conclusively presumed to not be a principal economic effect of the expansion or location. In the event that a transfer of employment will occur resulting from the expansion or location of an eligible next Michigan business into a next Michigan development district, the board of the Michigan strategic fund shall provide written notice of the order or resolution certifying the eligible next Michigan business as a qualifying next Michigan business to the chief executive officer of each county, city, village, and township from which the transfer of employment will occur within 10 days of the order or resolution certifying the qualified eligible next Michigan business. The chief executive officer of each county, city, village, and township notified under this subsection shall have 30 days to file an appeal of the certification with the board of the Michigan strategic fund. The board of the Michigan strategic fund shall decide the appeal within 45 days of the receipt of the appeal. The board of the Michigan strategic fund shall not certify an eligible next Michigan business as a qualified eligible next Michigan business if the business applicant has been convicted of a felony and the board of the Michigan strategic fund has determined that the conviction will have a material impact on the business applicant's ability to fulfill its obligations under this act. As used in this subsection, the business applicant includes the business entity, affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, managerial employees, and any person who, directly or indirectly, holds a pecuniary interest in that business entity of 20% or more.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Upon request of the next Michigan development corporation, the board of the Michigan strategic fund may modify an existing next Michigan renaissance zone to add additional property under the same terms and conditions as the existing next Michigan renaissance zone if all of the following are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The additional real property is located within the boundaries of the next Michigan development district and will be owned or operated by a qualified eligible next Michigan business once it is brought into operation as determined by the board of the Michigan strategic fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The next Michigan development corporation and the city, village, or township in which the qualified eligible next Michigan business is located consent to the modification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The aggregate territory limitations provided in subsection (1) will not be exceeded.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A qualified eligible next Michigan business in a next Michigan renaissance zone shall be granted the benefits of renaissance zone status for a period of up to 15 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The board of the Michigan strategic fund may revoke the designation of all or a portion of a next Michigan renaissance zone or the certification of a qualified eligible next Michigan business if the board of the Michigan strategic fund determines 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The qualified eligible next Michigan business proposed in the application fails, or a preponderance of businesses proposed in the application fail, to commence operation within 2 years from the date of the certification as a qualified eligible next Michigan business.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The qualified eligible next Michigan business proposed in the application to commence operation within the next Michigan renaissance zone ceases operation, provided that designation shall not be revoked if the qualified eligible next Michigan business has assigned its rights to a successor entity engaged in a qualified eligible next Michigan business.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The qualified eligible next Michigan business proposed in the application to commence operation within the next Michigan renaissance zone fails to commence construction or renovation within 1 year from the date of the certification as a qualified eligible next Michigan business.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The qualified eligible next Michigan business fails to meet jobs and investment criteria set forth in the application and approved as a condition by the president or the board of the Michigan strategic fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The local governmental unit in which the qualified eligible next Michigan business is located withdraws from the next Michigan development corporation interlocal agreement, provided that the tax incentives previously granted to the qualified eligible next Michigan business shall remain in full force and effect for the stated term of the tax incentives so long as the qualified eligible next Michigan business satisfies all of the conditions upon which the tax incentives were granted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the designation of all or a portion of a next Michigan renaissance zone or the certification of a qualified eligible next Michigan business is revoked, a qualified eligible next Michigan business affected may appeal that revocation to the board of the Michigan strategic fund. The designation may subsequently be restored by the board of the Michigan strategic fund to the same site and in respect of a qualified eligible next Michigan business, but the duration of the restored designation shall not exceed the term of the original designation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Upon request of the next Michigan development corporation, the board of the Michigan strategic fund may extend the duration of renaissance zone status for 1 or more portions of a next Michigan renaissance zone if the extension will increase capital investment or job creation, and the next Michigan development corporation and the city, village, or township in which that portion of the next Michigan renaissance zone is located consents to extend the duration of renaissance zone status. The board of the Michigan strategic fund may extend renaissance zone status for 1 or more portions of the next Michigan renaissance zone under this subsection for a period of time not to exceed 5 additional years as determined by the board of the Michigan strategic fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Before an eligible next Michigan business is certified as a qualified eligible next Michigan business, the board of the Michigan strategic fund shall enter into a written agreement with the next Michigan development corporation and a qualified eligible next Michigan business in respect of the terms and conditions of granting and retaining renaissance zone status, certification as a qualified eligible next Michigan business, and any other related matters. The written agreement also shall contain a remedy provision that includes, but is not limited to, all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A requirement that all or a portion of the exemptions, deductions, or credits described in section 9 shall be revoked under the procedures set forth in this act if the qualified eligible next Michigan business is determined to be in violation of the provisions of this act or the written agreement or relocates outside the next Michigan development district for a period of years after renaissance zone status expires as set forth in the written agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A requirement that the qualified eligible next Michigan business may be required to repay all or a portion of the exemptions, deductions, or credits described in section 9 if the qualified eligible next Michigan business is determined to be in violation of the provisions of this act or the written agreement or relocates outside the next Michigan development district for a period of years after renaissance zone status expires as set forth in the written agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the commencement of renaissance zone status under this section shall take effect on January 1 in the year following designation. However, for purposes of the taxes exempted under section 9(2), the commencement of renaissance zone status under this section shall take effect on December 31 in the year immediately preceding the year in which the commencement under this section takes effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The board of the Michigan strategic fund shall not certify more than 25 eligible businesses as qualified eligible next Michigan businesses under this act. The board of the Michigan strategic fund shall not certify more than 10 eligible businesses as qualified eligible next Michigan businesses in a next Michigan development district as defined in the next Michigan development act.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An ordinance shall not prevent the extraction, by mining, of valuable natural resources from any property unless very serious consequences would result from the extraction of those natural resources.

The planned unit development regulations need not be uniform with regard to each type of land use if equitable procedures recognizing due process principles and avoiding arbitrary decisions are followed in making regulatory decisions. Unless explicitly prohibited by the planned unit development regulations, if requested by the landowner, a local unit of government may approve a planned unit development with open space that is not contiguous with the rest of the planned unit development.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Following receipt of a request to approve a planned unit development, the body or official responsible for the review and approval shall hold at least 1 public hearing on the request. A zoning ordinance may provide for preapplication conferences before submission of a planned unit development request and the submission of preliminary site plans before the public hearing. Notification of the public hearing shall be given in the same manner as required under section 103.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Within a reasonable time following the public hearing, the body or official responsible for approving planned unit developments shall meet for final consideration of the request and deny, approve, or approve with conditions the request. The body or official shall prepare a report stating its conclusions, its decision, the basis for its decision, and any conditions imposed on an affirmative decision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If amendment of a zoning ordinance is required by the planned unit development regulations of a zoning ordinance, the requirements of this act for amendment of a zoning ordinance shall be followed, except that the hearing and notice required by this section shall fulfill the public hearing and notice requirements of section 306.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The remaining regular members of a zoning board of appeals, and any alternate members under subsection (7), shall be selected from the electors of the local unit of government residing within the zoning jurisdiction of that local unit of government or, in the case of a county, residing within the county but outside of any city or village. The members selected shall be representative of the population distribution and of the various interests present in the local unit of government.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Subject to subsection (2), 1 regular or alternate member of a zoning board of appeals may be a member of the legislative body. Such a member shall not serve as chairperson of the zoning board of appeals. An employee or contractor of the legislative body may not serve as a member of the zoning board of appeals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The legislative body may appoint to the zoning board of appeals not more than 2 alternate members for the same term as regular members. An alternate member may be called as specified in the zoning ordinance to serve as a member of the zoning board of appeals in the absence of a regular member if the regular member will be unable to attend 1 or more meetings. An alternate member may also be called to serve as a member for the purpose of reaching a decision on a case in which the member has abstained for reasons of conflict of interest. The alternate member appointed shall serve in the case until a final decision is made. An alternate member serving on the zoning board of appeals has the same voting rights as a regular member.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A member of the zoning board of appeals may be paid a reasonable per diem and reimbursed for expenses actually incurred in the discharge of his or her duties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A member of the zoning board of appeals may be removed by the legislative body for misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office upon written charges and after a public hearing. A member shall disqualify himself or herself from a vote in which the member has a conflict of interest. Failure of a member to disqualify himself or herself from a vote in which the member has a conflict of interest constitutes malfeasance in office.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The terms of office for an appointed member of the zoning board of appeals shall be 3 years, except for a member serving because of his or her membership on the zoning commission or legislative body, whose term shall be limited to the time he or she is a member of that body. When members are first appointed, appointments may be for less than 3 years to provide for staggered terms. A successor shall be appointed not more than 1 month after the term of the preceding member has expired.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A vacancy on the zoning board of appeals shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term in the same manner as the original appointment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A zoning board of appeals shall not conduct business unless a majority of the regular members of the zoning board of appeals are present.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) A member of the zoning board of appeals who is also a member of the zoning commission, the planning commission, or the legislative body shall not participate in a public hearing on or vote on the same matter that the member voted on as a member of the zoning commission, the planning commission, or the legislative body. However, the member may consider and vote on other unrelated matters involving the same property.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An appeal to the zoning board of appeals may be taken by a person aggrieved or by an officer, department, board, or bureau of this state or the local unit of government. In addition, a variance in the zoning ordinance may be applied for and granted under section 4 of the uniform condemnation procedures act, 1980 PA 87, MCL 213.54, and as provided under this act. The zoning board of appeals shall state the grounds of any determination made by the board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An appeal under this section shall be taken within such time as prescribed by the zoning board of appeals by general rule, by filing with the body or officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the zoning board of appeals a notice of appeal specifying the grounds for the appeal. The body or officer from whom the appeal is taken shall immediately transmit to the zoning board of appeals all of the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An appeal to the zoning board of appeals stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed. However, if the body or officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the zoning board of appeals after the notice of appeal is filed that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in the opinion of the body or officer cause imminent peril to life or property, proceedings may be stayed only by a restraining order issued by the zoning board of appeals or a circuit court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Following receipt of a written request for a variance, the zoning board of appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the request and give notice as provided in section 103.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the zoning board of appeals receives a written request seeking an interpretation of the zoning ordinance or an appeal of an administrative decision, the zoning board of appeals shall conduct a public hearing on the request. Notice shall be given as required under section 103. However, if the request does not involve a specific parcel of property, notice need only be published as provided in section 103(1) and given to the person making the request as provided in section 103(3).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If there are practical difficulties for nonuse variances as provided in subsection (8) or unnecessary hardship for use variances as provided in subsection (9) in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the zoning ordinance, the zoning board of appeals may grant a variance in accordance with this section, so that the spirit of the zoning ordinance is observed, public safety secured, and substantial justice done. The ordinance shall establish procedures for the review and standards for approval of all types of variances. The zoning board of appeals may impose conditions as otherwise allowed under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The zoning board of appeals of all local units of government shall have the authority to grant nonuse variances relating to the construction, structural changes, or alteration of buildings or structures related to dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance or to any other nonuse-related standard in the ordinance.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Cities and villages.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Townships and counties that as of February 15, 2006 had an ordinance that uses the phrase "use variance" or "variances from uses of land" to expressly authorize the granting of use variances by the zoning board of appeals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Townships and counties that granted a use variance before February 15, 2006.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The authority granted under subsection (9) is subject to the zoning ordinance of the local unit of government otherwise being in compliance with subsection (7) and having an ordinance provision that requires a vote of 2/3 of the members of the zoning board of appeals to approve a use variance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The authority to grant use variances under subsection (9) is permissive, and this section does not require a local unit of government to adopt ordinance provisions to allow for the granting of use variances.</div>

If a township is subject to county zoning consistent with section 209 of the Michigan zoning enabling act, 2006 PA 110, MCL 125.3209, or a city or village is subject to county zoning pursuant to the Michigan zoning enabling act, 2006 PA 110, MCL 125.3101 to 125.3702, and a contract under the urban cooperation act of 1967, 1967 (Ex Sess) PA 7, MCL 124.501 to 124.512, or 1967 (Ex Sess) PA 8, MCL 124.531 to 124.536, the county planning commission may recommend to the legislative body of the municipality provisions of an ordinance or rules governing the subdivision of land authorized under section 105 of the land division act, 1967 PA 288, MCL 560.105. A planning commission may proceed under this subsection on its own initiative or upon request of the appropriate legislative body.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Recommendations for a subdivision ordinance or rule may address plat design, including the proper arrangement of streets in relation to other existing or planned streets and to the master plan; adequate and convenient open spaces for traffic, utilities, access of firefighting apparatus, recreation, light, and air; and the avoidance of congestion of population, including minimum width and area of lots. The recommendations may also address the extent to which streets shall be graded and improved and to which water and sewer and other utility mains, piping, or other facilities shall be installed as a condition precedent to the approval of a plat. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Before recommending an ordinance or rule described in subsection (1), the planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed ordinance or rule.

If a township is subject to county zoning consistent with section 209 of the Michigan zoning enabling act, 2006 PA 110, MCL 125.3209, or a city or village is subject to county zoning pursuant to the Michigan zoning enabling act, 2006 PA 110, MCL 125.3101 to 125.3702, and a contract under the urban cooperation act of 1967, 1967 (Ex Sess) PA 7, MCL 124.501 to 124.512, or 1967 (Ex Sess) PA 8, MCL 124.531 to 124.536, and the municipality has adopted a master plan or master street plan, the county planning commission shall also review and make recommendations on plats before action thereon by the legislative body of the municipality under section 112 of the land division act, 1967 PA 288, MCL 560.112.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A planning commission shall not take action on a proposed plat without affording an opportunity for a public hearing thereon. A plat submitted to the planning commission shall contain the name and address of the proprietor or other person to whom notice of a hearing shall be sent. Not less than 15 days before the date of the hearing, notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing shall be sent to that person at that address by mail and shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality. Similar notice shall be mailed to the owners of land immediately adjoining the proposed platted land.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A planning commission shall recommend approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval of a plat within 63 days after the plat is submitted to the planning commission. If applicable standards under the land division act, 1967 PA 288, MCL 560.101 to 560.293, and an ordinance or published rules governing the subdivision of land authorized under section 105 of that act, MCL 560.105, are met, the planning commission shall recommend approval of the plat. If the planning commission fails to act within the required period, the plat shall be considered to have been recommended for approval, and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the planning commission upon request of the proprietor. However, the proprietor may waive this requirement and consent to an extension of the 63-day period. The grounds for any recommendation of disapproval of a plat shall be stated upon the records of the planning commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A plat approved by a municipality and recorded under section 172 of the land division act, 1967 PA 288, MCL 560.172, shall be considered to be an amendment to the master plan and a part thereof. Approval of a plat by a municipality does not constitute or effect an acceptance by the public of any street or other open space shown upon the plat. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) When the governing body of a municipality determines that it is necessary for the best interests of the public to halt property value deterioration and increase property tax valuation where possible in its business district, to eliminate the causes of that deterioration, and to promote economic growth, the governing body may, by resolution, declare its intention to create and provide for the operation of an authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In the resolution of intent, the governing body shall set a date for the holding of a public hearing on the adoption of a proposed ordinance creating the authority and designating the boundaries of the downtown district. Notice of the public hearing shall be published twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality, not less than 20 or more than 40 days before the date of the hearing. Not less than 20 days before the hearing, the governing body proposing to create the authority shall also mail notice of the hearing to the property taxpayers of record in the proposed district and for a public hearing to be held after February 15, 1994 to the governing body of each taxing jurisdiction levying taxes that would be subject to capture if the authority is established and a tax increment financing plan is approved. Beginning June 1, 2005, the notice of hearing within the time frame described in this subsection shall be mailed by certified mail to the governing body of each taxing jurisdiction levying taxes that would be subject to capture if the authority is established and a tax increment financing plan is approved. Failure of a property taxpayer to receive the notice shall not invalidate these proceedings. Notice of the hearing shall be posted in at least 20 conspicuous and public places in the proposed downtown district not less than 20 days before the hearing. The notice shall state the date, time, and place of the hearing, and shall describe the boundaries of the proposed downtown district. A citizen, taxpayer, or property owner of the municipality or an official from a taxing jurisdiction with millage that would be subject to capture has the right to be heard in regard to the establishment of the authority and the boundaries of the proposed downtown district. The governing body of the municipality shall not incorporate land into the downtown district not included in the description contained in the notice of public hearing, but it may eliminate described lands from the downtown district in the final determination of the boundaries.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Not more than 60 days after a public hearing held after February 15, 1994, the governing body of a taxing jurisdiction levying ad valorem property taxes that would otherwise be subject to capture may exempt its taxes from capture by adopting a resolution to that effect and filing a copy with the clerk of the municipality proposing to create the authority. The resolution takes effect when filed with that clerk and remains effective until a copy of a resolution rescinding that resolution is filed with that clerk. If a separate millage for public library purposes was levied before January 1, 2017, and all obligations and other protected obligations of the authority are paid, then the levy is exempt from capture under this part, unless the library board or commission allows all or a portion of its taxes levied to be included as tax increment revenues and subject to capture under this part under the terms of a written agreement between the library board or commission and the authority. The written agreement shall be filed with the clerk of the municipality. However, if a separate millage for public library purposes was levied before January 1, 2017, and the authority alters or amends the boundaries of a downtown district or extends the duration of the existing finance plan, then the library board or commission may, not later than 60 days after a public hearing is held under this subsection, exempt all or a portion of its taxes from capture by adopting a resolution to that effect and filing a copy with the clerk of the municipality that created the authority. For ad valorem property taxes or specific local taxes attributable to those ad valorem property taxes levied for a separate millage for public library purposes approved by the electors after December 31, 2016, a library board or commission may allow all or a portion of its taxes levied to be included as tax increment revenues and subject to capture under this part under the terms of a written agreement between the library board or commission and the authority. The written agreement shall be filed with the clerk of the municipality. However, if the library was created under section 1 or 10a of 1877 PA 164, MCL 397.201 and 397.210a, or established under 1869 LA 233, then any action of the library board or commission under this subsection shall have the concurrence of the chief executive officer of the city that created the library to be effective, and, if the action of the library board or commission involves any bond issued by this state or a state agency, the concurrence of the state treasurer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Not less than 60 days after the public hearing, if the governing body of the municipality intends to proceed with the establishment of the authority, it shall adopt, by majority vote of its members, an ordinance establishing the authority and designating the boundaries of the downtown district within which the authority shall exercise its powers. The adoption of the ordinance is subject to any applicable statutory or charter provisions in respect to the approval or disapproval by the chief executive or other officer of the municipality and the adoption of an ordinance over his or her veto. This ordinance shall be filed with the secretary of state promptly after its adoption and shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The governing body of the municipality may alter or amend the boundaries of the downtown district to include or exclude lands from the downtown district pursuant to the same requirements for adopting the ordinance creating the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A municipality that has created an authority may enter into an agreement with an adjoining municipality that has created an authority to jointly operate and administer those authorities under an interlocal agreement under the urban cooperation act of 1967, 1967 (Ex Sess) PA 7, MCL 124.501 to 124.512.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A municipality that has created an authority may enter into an agreement with a qualified township to operate its authority in a downtown district in the qualified township under an interlocal agreement under the urban cooperation act of 1967, 1967 (Ex Sess) PA 7, MCL 124.501 to 124.512. The interlocal agreement between the municipality and the qualified township shall provide for, but is not limited to, all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Size and makeup of the board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Determination and modification of downtown district, business district, and development area.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Modification of development area and development plan.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the amount to be retained and paid under subsection (3) is less than the amount calculated under subsection (5), the difference between those amounts.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The captured assessed value of industrial personal property, commercial personal property, and the personal property component of exemption certificates granted under 1974 PA 198, MCL 207.551 to 207.572, that are sited on property classified as either industrial or commercial, for the authority's fiscal year ending in the current year.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) When the authority determines that it is necessary for the achievement of the purposes of this part, the authority shall prepare and submit a tax increment financing plan to the governing body of the municipality. The plan shall include a development plan as provided in section 217, a detailed explanation of the tax increment procedure, the maximum amount of bonded indebtedness to be incurred, and the duration of the program, and shall be in compliance with section 215. The plan shall contain a statement of the estimated impact of tax increment financing on the assessed values of all taxing jurisdictions in which the development area is located. The plan may provide for the use of part or all of the captured assessed value, but the portion intended to be used by the authority shall be clearly stated in the tax increment financing plan. The authority or municipality may exclude from captured assessed value growth in property value resulting solely from inflation. The plan shall set forth the method for excluding growth in property value resulting solely from inflation. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The percentage of taxes levied for school operating purposes that is captured and used by the tax increment financing plan shall not be greater than the plan's percentage capture and use of taxes levied by a municipality or county for operating purposes. For purposes of the previous sentence, taxes levied by a county for operating purposes include only millage allocated for county or charter county purposes under the property tax limitation act, 1933 PA 62, MCL 211.201 to 211.217a. For purposes of this subsection, tax increment revenues used to pay bonds issued by a municipality under section 216(1) shall be considered to be used by the tax increment financing plan rather than shared with the municipality. The limitation of this subsection does not apply to the portion of the captured assessed value shared pursuant to an agreement entered into before 1989 with a county or with a city in which an enterprise zone is approved under section 13 of the enterprise zone act, 1985 PA 224, MCL 125.2113.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Approval of the tax increment financing plan shall be pursuant to the notice, hearing, and disclosure provisions of section 218. If the development plan is part of the tax increment financing plan, only 1 hearing and approval procedure is required for the 2 plans together.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Before the public hearing on the tax increment financing plan, the governing body shall provide a reasonable opportunity to the taxing jurisdictions levying taxes subject to capture to meet with the governing body. The authority shall fully inform the taxing jurisdictions of the fiscal and economic implications of the proposed development area. The taxing jurisdictions may present their recommendations at the public hearing on the tax increment financing plan. The authority may enter into agreements with the taxing jurisdictions and the governing body of the municipality in which the development area is located to share a portion of the captured assessed value of the district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A tax increment financing plan may be modified if the modification is approved by the governing body upon notice and after public hearings and agreements as are required for approval of the original plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Under a tax increment financing plan that includes a catalyst development project, an authority may pledge available tax increment revenues of the authority as security for any bonds issued to develop and construct a catalyst development project.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The municipality may by resolution of its governing body authorize, issue, and sell general obligation bonds subject to the limitations set forth in this subsection to finance the development program of the tax increment financing plan and shall pledge its full faith and credit for the payment of the bonds. The municipality may pledge as additional security for the bonds any money received by the authority or the municipality pursuant to section 211. The bonds are subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821. Before the municipality may authorize the borrowing, the authority shall submit an estimate of the anticipated tax increment revenues and other revenue available under section 211 to be available for payment of principal and interest on the bonds, to the governing body of the municipality. This estimate shall be approved by the governing body of the municipality by resolution adopted by majority vote of the members of the governing body in the resolution authorizing the bonds. If the governing body of the municipality adopts the resolution authorizing the bonds, the estimate of the anticipated tax increment revenues and other revenue available under section 211 to be available for payment of principal and interest on the bonds shall be conclusive for purposes of this section. The bonds issued under this subsection shall be considered a single series for the purposes of the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2801.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) By resolution of its governing body, the authority may authorize, issue, and sell tax increment bonds subject to the limitations set forth in this subsection to finance the development program of the tax increment financing plan. The tax increment bonds issued by the authority under this subsection shall pledge solely the tax increment revenues of a development area in which the project is located or a development area from which tax increment revenues may be used for this project, or both. In addition or in the alternative, the bonds issued by the authority pursuant to this subsection may be secured by any other revenues identified in section 211 as sources of financing for activities of the authority that the authority shall specifically pledge in the resolution. However, the full faith and credit of the municipality shall not be pledged to secure bonds issued pursuant to this subsection. The bond issue may include a sum sufficient to pay interest on the tax increment bonds until full development of tax increment revenues from the project and also a sum to provide a reasonable reserve for payment of principal and interest on the bonds. The resolution authorizing the bonds shall create a lien on the tax increment revenues and other revenues pledged by the resolution that shall be a statutory lien and shall be a first lien subject only to liens previously created. The resolution may provide the terms upon which additional bonds may be issued of equal standing and parity of lien as to the tax increment revenues and other revenues pledged under the resolution. Bonds issued under this subsection that pledge revenue received under section 211 for repayment of the bonds are subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, if the state treasurer determines that an authority or municipality can issue a qualified refunding obligation and the authority or municipality does not make a good-faith effort to issue the qualified refunding obligation as determined by the state treasurer, the state treasurer may reduce the amount claimed by the authority or municipality under section 213b by an amount equal to the net present value saving that would have been realized had the authority or municipality refunded the obligation or the state treasurer may require a reduction in the capture of tax increment revenues from taxes levied by a local or intermediate school district or this state by an amount equal to the net present value savings that would have been realized had the authority or municipality refunded the obligation. This subsection does not authorize the state treasurer to require the authority or municipality to pledge security greater than the security pledged for the obligation being refunded.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the governing body of a municipality determines that it is in the best interests of the public to halt a decline in property values, increase property tax valuation, eliminate the causes of the decline in property values, and to promote growth in an area in the municipality, the governing body of that municipality may declare by resolution its intention to create and provide for the operation of an authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In the resolution of intent, the governing body shall set a date for the holding of a public hearing on the adoption of a proposed resolution creating the authority and designating the boundaries of the authority district. Notice of the public hearing shall be published twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality, not less than 20 nor more than 40 days before the date of the hearing. Notice shall also be mailed to the property taxpayers of record in the proposed authority district not less than 20 days before the hearing. Beginning June 1, 2005, the notice of hearing within the time frame described in this subsection shall be mailed by certified mail to the governing body of each taxing jurisdiction levying taxes that would be subject to capture if the authority is established and a tax increment financing plan is approved. Failure to receive the notice shall not invalidate these proceedings. The notice shall state the date, time, and place of the hearing, and shall describe the boundaries of the proposed authority district. At that hearing, a citizen, taxpayer, or property owner of the municipality has the right to be heard in regard to the establishment of the authority and the boundaries of the proposed authority district. The governing body of the municipality shall not incorporate land into the authority district not included in the description contained in the notice of public hearing, but it may eliminate described lands from the authority district in the final determination of the boundaries.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) After the public hearing, if the governing body intends to proceed with the establishment of the authority, it shall adopt, by majority vote of its members, a resolution establishing the authority and designating the boundaries of the authority district within which the authority shall exercise its powers. The adoption of the resolution is subject to any applicable statutory or charter provisions with respect to the approval or disapproval by the chief executive or other officer of the municipality and the adoption of a resolution over his or her veto. This resolution shall be filed with the secretary of state promptly after its adoption and shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The governing body may alter or amend the boundaries of the authority district to include or exclude lands from the authority district in accordance with the same requirements prescribed for adopting the resolution creating the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The validity of the proceedings establishing an authority shall be conclusive unless contested in a court of competent jurisdiction within 60 days after the last of the following takes place:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Publication of the resolution as adopted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Filing of the resolution with the secretary of state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a separate millage for public library purposes was levied before January 1, 2017, and all obligations and other protected obligations of the authority are paid, then the levy is exempt from capture under this part, unless the library board or commission allows all or a portion of its taxes levied to be included as tax increment revenues and subject to capture under this part under the terms of a written agreement between the library board or commission and the authority. The written agreement shall be filed with the clerk of the municipality. However, if a separate millage for public library purposes was levied before January 1, 2017, and the authority alters or amends the boundaries of the authority district or extends the duration of the existing finance plan, then the library board or commission may, not later than 60 days after a public hearing is held under this subsection, exempt all or a portion of its taxes from capture by adopting a resolution to that effect and filing a copy with the clerk of the municipality that created the authority. For ad valorem property taxes or specific local taxes attributable to those ad valorem property taxes levied for a separate millage for public library purposes approved by the electors after December 31, 2016, a library board or commission may allow all or a portion of its taxes levied to be included as tax increment revenues and subject to capture under this part under the terms of a written agreement between the library board or commission and the authority. The written agreement shall be filed with the clerk of the municipality. However, if the library was created under section 1 or 10a of 1877 PA 164, MCL 397.201 and 397.210a, or established under 1869 LA 233, then any action of the library board or commission under this subsection shall have the concurrence of the chief executive officer of the city that created the library to be effective.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The captured assessed value of industrial personal property, commercial personal property, and the personal property component of exemption certificates granted under 1974 PA 198, MCL 207.551 to 207.572, that are sited on property classified as either industrial or commercial, for the authority's fiscal year ending in the current year.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The state tax commission may provide that the reimbursement calculations under this section and the calculation of allowable capture of school taxes shall be made for each calendar year's tax increment revenues using a 12-month debt payment period used by the authority and approved by the state tax commission.</div>

The plan shall be in compliance with section 314 and shall include a development plan as provided in section 316. The plan shall also contain the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A statement of the reasons that the plan will result in the development of captured assessed value that could not otherwise be expected. The reasons may include, but are not limited to, activities of the municipality, authority, or others undertaken before formulation or adoption of the plan in reasonable anticipation that the objectives of the plan would be achieved by some means.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An estimate of the captured assessed value for each year of the plan. The plan may provide for the use of part or all of the captured assessed value, but the portion intended to be used shall be clearly stated in the plan. The authority or municipality may exclude from captured assessed value growth in property value resulting solely from inflation. The plan shall set forth the method for excluding growth in property value resulting solely from inflation. The percentage of taxes levied for school operating purposes that is captured and used by the plan shall not be greater than the plan's percentage capture and use of taxes levied by a municipality or county for operating purposes. For purposes of the previous sentence, taxes levied by a county for operating purposes include only millage allocated for county or charter county purposes under the property tax limitation act, 1933 PA 62, MCL 211.201 to 211.217a. This limitation does not apply to the portion of the captured assessed value shared pursuant to an agreement entered into before 1989 with a county or with a city in which an enterprise zone is approved under section 13 of the enterprise zone act, 1985 PA 224, MCL 125.2113.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The amount of operating and planning expenditures of the authority and municipality, the amount of advances extended by or indebtedness incurred by the municipality, and the amount of advances by others to be repaid from tax increment revenues. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The costs of the plan anticipated to be paid from tax increment revenues as received. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The duration of the development plan and the tax increment plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) An estimate of the impact of tax increment financing on the revenues of all taxing jurisdictions in which the development area is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Approval of the tax increment financing plan shall be in accordance with the notice, hearing, disclosure, and approval provisions of sections 317 and 318. When the development plan is part of the tax increment financing plan, only 1 hearing and approval procedure is required for the 2 plans together.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Before the public hearing on the tax increment financing plan, the governing body shall provide a reasonable opportunity to the taxing jurisdictions in which the development is located to express their views and recommendations regarding the tax increment financing plan. The authority shall fully inform the taxing jurisdictions about the fiscal and economic implications of the proposed tax increment financing plan. The taxing jurisdictions may present their recommendations at the public hearing on the tax increment financing plan. The authority may enter into agreements with the taxing jurisdictions and the governing body of the municipality in which the development area is located to share a portion of the captured assessed value of the district.</div>

Any surplus funds not so used shall revert proportionately to the respective taxing bodies. These revenues shall not be used to circumvent existing property tax laws or a local charter that provides a maximum authorized rate for levy of property taxes. The governing body may abolish the tax increment financing plan when it finds that the purposes for which the plan was established are accomplished. However, the tax increment finance plan shall not be abolished, allowed to expire, or otherwise terminate until the principal of, and interest on, bonds issued pursuant to section 315 have been paid or funds sufficient to make the payment have been segregated.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, if the state treasurer determines that an authority or municipality can issue a qualified refunding obligation and the authority or municipality does not make a good-faith effort to issue the qualified refunding obligation as determined by the state treasurer, the state treasurer may reduce the amount claimed by the authority or municipality under section 312a by an amount equal to the net present value saving that would have been realized had the authority or municipality refunded the obligation or the state treasurer may require a reduction in the capture of tax increment revenues from taxes levied by a local or intermediate school district or this state by an amount equal to the net present value savings that would have been realized had the authority or municipality refunded the obligation. This subsection does not authorize the state treasurer to require the authority or municipality to pledge security greater than the security pledged for the obligation being refunded.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The governing body of a municipality may declare by resolution adopted by a majority of its members elected and serving its intention to create and provide for the operation of an authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In the resolution of intent, the governing body proposing to create the authority shall set a date for holding a public hearing on the adoption of a proposed resolution creating the authority and designating the boundaries of the authority district or districts. Notice of the public hearing shall be published twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality, not less than 20 nor more than 40 days before the date of the hearing. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (8), not less than 20 days before the hearing, the governing body proposing to create the authority shall also mail notice of the hearing to the property taxpayers of record in a proposed authority district and, for a public hearing to be held after February 15, 1994, to the governing body of each taxing jurisdiction levying taxes that would be subject to capture if the authority is established and a tax increment financing plan is approved. Beginning June 1, 2005, the notice of hearing within the time frame described in this subsection shall be mailed by certified mail to the governing body of each taxing jurisdiction levying taxes that would be subject to capture if the authority is established and a tax increment financing plan is approved. Failure of a property taxpayer to receive the notice shall not invalidate these proceedings. The notice shall state the date, time, and place of the hearing, and shall describe the boundaries of the proposed authority district or districts. At that hearing, a resident, taxpayer, or property owner from a taxing jurisdiction in which the proposed district is located or an official from a taxing jurisdiction with millage that would be subject to capture has the right to be heard in regard to the establishment of the authority and the boundaries of that proposed authority district. The governing body of the municipality in which a proposed district is to be located shall not incorporate land into an authority district not included in the description contained in the notice of public hearing, but it may eliminate lands described in the notice of public hearing from an authority district in the final determination of the boundaries.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (8), not more than 60 days after a public hearing held after February 15, 1994, the governing body of a taxing jurisdiction with millage that would otherwise be subject to capture may exempt its taxes from capture by adopting a resolution to that effect and filing a copy with the clerk of the municipality proposing to create the authority. However, a resolution by a governing body of a taxing jurisdiction to exempt its taxes from capture is not effective for the capture of taxes that are used for a certified technology park or a certified alternative energy park. The resolution takes effect when filed with that clerk and remains effective until a copy of a resolution rescinding that resolution is filed with that clerk. If a separate millage for public library purposes was levied before January 1, 2017, and all obligations and other protected obligations of the authority are paid, then the levy is exempt from capture under this part, unless the library board or commission allows all or a portion of its taxes levied to be included as tax increment revenues and subject to capture under this part under the terms of a written agreement between the library board or commission and the authority. The written agreement shall be filed with the clerk of the municipality. However, if a separate millage for public library purposes was levied before January 1, 2017, and the authority alters or amends the boundaries of the authority district or extends the duration of the existing finance plan, then the library board or commission may, not later than 60 days after a public hearing is held under this subsection, exempt all or a portion of its taxes from capture by adopting a resolution to that effect and filing a copy with the clerk of the municipality that created the authority. For ad valorem property taxes or specific local taxes attributable to those ad valorem property taxes levied for a separate millage for public library purposes approved by the electors after December 31, 2016, a library board or commission may allow all or a portion of its taxes levied to be included as tax increment revenues and subject to capture under this part under the terms of a written agreement between the library board or commission and the authority. The written agreement shall be filed with the clerk of the municipality. However, if the library was created under section 1 or 10a of 1877 PA 164, MCL 397.201 and 397.210a, or established under 1869 LA 233, then any action of the library board or commission under this subsection shall have the concurrence of the chief executive officer of the city that created the library to be effective.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (8), not less than 60 days after the public hearing or a shorter period as determined by the governing body for a certified technology park or a certified alternative energy park, if the governing body creating the authority intends to proceed with the establishment of the authority, it shall adopt, by majority vote of its members elected and serving, a resolution establishing the authority and designating the boundaries of the authority district or districts within which the authority shall exercise its powers. The adoption of the resolution is subject to any applicable statutory or charter provisions with respect to the approval or disapproval of resolutions by the chief executive officer of the municipality and the adoption of a resolution over his or her veto. This resolution shall be filed with the secretary of state promptly after its adoption and shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The governing body may alter or amend the boundaries of an authority district to include or exclude lands from that authority district or create new authority districts pursuant to the same requirements prescribed for adopting the resolution creating the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The validity of the proceedings establishing an authority shall be conclusive unless contested in a court of competent jurisdiction within 60 days after the last of the following takes place:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Publication of the resolution creating the authority as adopted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Filing of the resolution creating the authority with the secretary of state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, if 2 or more municipalities desire to establish an authority under section 403(2), each municipality in which the authority district will be located shall comply with the procedures prescribed by this part. The notice required by subsection (2) may be published jointly by the municipalities establishing the authority. The resolutions establishing the authority shall include, or shall approve an agreement including, provisions governing the number of members on the board, the method of appointment, the members to be represented by governmental units or agencies, the terms of initial and subsequent appointments to the board, the manner in which a member of the board may be removed for cause before the expiration of his or her term, the manner in which the authority may be dissolved, and the disposition of assets upon dissolution. An authority described in this subsection shall not be considered established unless all of the following conditions are satisfied:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A resolution is approved and filed with the secretary of state by each municipality in which the authority district will be located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The same boundaries have been approved for the authority district by the governing body of each municipality in which the authority district will be located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The governing body of the county in which a majority of the authority district will be located has approved by resolution the creation of the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) For an authority created under section 403(3), except as otherwise provided by this subsection, the Next Michigan development corporation shall comply with the procedures prescribed for a municipality by subsections (1) and (2) and this subsection. The provisions of subsections (3) and (4) shall not apply to an authority exercising its powers under section 403(3). The notice required by subsection (2) may be published by the Next Michigan development corporation in a newspaper or newspapers of general circulation within the municipalities which are constituent members of the Next Michigan development corporation, and notice shall not be required to be mailed to the property taxpayers of record in the proposed authority district. The governing body of the Next Michigan development corporation shall be the governing body of the authority. A taxing jurisdiction levying ad valorem taxes within the authority district that would otherwise be subject to capture which is not a party to the intergovernmental agreement may exempt its taxes from capture by adopting a resolution to that effect and filing a copy not more than 60 days after the public hearing with the recording officer of the Next Michigan development corporation. The Next Michigan development corporation shall mail notice of the public hearing to the governing body of each taxing jurisdiction which is not a party to the intergovernmental agreement not less than 20 days before the hearing. Following the public hearing, the governing body of the Next Michigan development corporation shall adopt a resolution designating the boundaries of the authority district within which the authority shall exercise its powers, which may include any certified technology park within the proposed authority district in accordance with this subsection and may include property adjacent to or within 1,500 feet of a road classified as an arterial or collector according to the Federal Highway Administration manual "Highway Functional Classification - Concepts, Criteria and Procedures" or of another road in the discretion of the Next Michigan development corporation, and property adjacent to that property within the territory of the Next Michigan development corporation, as provided in the resolution. The resolution shall be effective when adopted, shall be filed with the secretary of state and the president of the Michigan strategic fund promptly after its adoption, and shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the territory of the Next Michigan development corporation. If an authority district designated under this subsection or subsequently amended includes a certified technology park which is within the authority district of another authority and which is subject to an existing development plan or tax increment financing plan, then that certified technology park may be considered to be under the jurisdiction of the authority established under section 403(3) if so provided in a resolution of the authority established under section 403(3) and if approved by resolution of the governing body of the municipality which created the other authority, and by the president of the Michigan strategic fund. If so provided and approved, then the development plan and tax increment financing plan applicable to the certified technology park, including all assets and obligations under the plans, shall be considered assigned and transferred from the other authority to the authority created under section 403(3), and the initial assessed value of the certified technology park prior to the transfer shall remain the initial assessed value of the certified technology park following the transfer. The transfer shall be effective as of the later of the effective date of the resolution of the authority established under section 403(3), the resolution approved by the governing body of the municipality which created the other authority, and the approval of the president of the Michigan strategic fund.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the board determines that it is necessary for the achievement of the purposes of this part, the board shall prepare and submit a tax increment financing plan to the governing body. The plan shall be in compliance with section 413 and shall include a development plan as provided in section 415. The plan shall also contain the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A statement of the reasons that the plan will result in the development of captured assessed value that could not otherwise be expected. The reasons may include, but are not limited to, activities of the municipality, authority, or others undertaken before formulation or adoption of the plan in reasonable anticipation that the objectives of the plan would be achieved by some means.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An estimate of the captured assessed value for each year of the plan. The plan may provide for the use of part or all of the captured assessed value or, subject to subsection (3), of the tax increment revenues attributable to the levy of any taxing jurisdiction, but the portion intended to be used shall be clearly stated in the plan. The board or the municipality creating the authority may exclude from captured assessed value a percentage of captured assessed value as specified in the plan or growth in property value resulting solely from inflation. If excluded, the plan shall set forth the method for excluding growth in property value resulting solely from inflation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The estimated tax increment revenues for each year of the plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A detailed explanation of the tax increment procedure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The maximum amount of note or bonded indebtedness to be incurred, if any.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The amount of operating and planning expenditures of the authority and municipality, the amount of advances extended by or indebtedness incurred by the municipality, and the amount of advances by others to be repaid from tax increment revenues.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The costs of the plan anticipated to be paid from tax increment revenues as received.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The duration of the development plan and the tax increment plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) An estimate of the impact of tax increment financing on the revenues of all taxing jurisdictions in which the eligible property is or is anticipated to be located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) A legal description of the eligible property to which the tax increment financing plan applies or shall apply upon qualification as eligible property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) An estimate of the number of jobs to be created as a result of implementation of the tax increment financing plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) The proposed boundaries of a certified technology park to be created under an agreement proposed to be entered into pursuant to section 412a, or of a certified alternative energy park to be created under an agreement proposed to be entered into pursuant to section 412c, or of a Next Michigan development area designated under section 412e, an identification of the real property within the certified technology park, the certified alternative energy park, or the Next Michigan development area to be included in the tax increment financing plan for purposes of determining tax increment revenues, and whether personal property located in the certified technology park, the certified alternative energy park, or the Next Michigan development area is exempt from determining tax increment revenues.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as provided in subsection (7), a tax increment financing plan shall provide for the use of tax increment revenues for public facilities for eligible property whose captured assessed value produces the tax increment revenues or, to the extent the eligible property is located within a business development area or a Next Michigan development area, for other eligible property located in the business development area or the Next Michigan development area. Public facilities for eligible property include the development or improvement of access to and around, or within the eligible property, of road facilities reasonably required by traffic flow to be generated by the eligible property, and the development or improvement of public facilities that are necessary to service the eligible property, whether or not located on that eligible property. If the eligible property identified in the tax increment financing plan is property to which section 402(p)(iv) applies, the tax increment financing plan shall not provide for the use of tax increment revenues for public facilities other than those described in the development plan as of April 1, 1991. Whether or not provided in the tax increment financing plan, if the eligible property identified in the tax increment financing plan is property to which section 402(s)(iv) applies, then to the extent that captured tax increment revenues are utilized for the costs of cleanup of identified soil and groundwater contamination, the captured tax increment revenues shall be first credited against the shares of responsibility for the total costs of cleanup of uncollectible parties who are responsible for the identified soil and groundwater contamination pursuant to law, and then shall be credited on a pro rata basis against the shares of responsibility for the total costs of cleanup of other parties who are responsible for the identified soil and groundwater contamination pursuant to law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The percentage of taxes levied for school operating purposes that is captured and used by the tax increment financing plan and the tax increment financing plans under part 2, part 3, and the brownfield redevelopment financing act, 1996 PA 381, MCL 125.2651 to 125.2672, shall not be greater than the percentage capture and use of taxes levied by a municipality or county for operating purposes under the tax increment financing plan and tax increment financing plans under part 2, part 3, and the brownfield redevelopment financing act, 1996 PA 381, MCL 125.2651 to 125.2672. For purposes of the previous sentence, taxes levied by a county for operating purposes include only millage allocated for county or charter county purposes under the property tax limitation act, 1933 PA 62, MCL 211.201 to 211.217a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, approval of the tax increment financing plan shall be in accordance with the notice, hearing, disclosure, and approval provisions of sections 416 and 417. If the development plan is part of the tax increment financing plan, only 1 hearing and approval procedure is required for the 2 plans together. For a plan submitted by an authority established by 2 or more municipalities under sections 403(2) and 404(7) or by an authority established by a Next Michigan development corporation under sections 403(3) and 404(8), the notice required by section 416 may be published jointly by the municipalities in which the authority district is located or by the Next Michigan development corporation. For a plan submitted by an authority exercising its powers under sections 403(2) and 404(7), the plan shall not be considered approved unless each governing body in which the authority district is located makes the determinations required by section 417 and approves the same plan, including the same modifications, if any, made to the plan by any other governing body. A plan submitted by an authority exercising its powers under sections 403(3) and 404(8) shall be approved if the governing body of the Next Michigan development corporation makes the determinations required by section 417.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Before the public hearing on the tax increment financing plan, the governing body shall provide a reasonable opportunity to the taxing jurisdictions levying taxes subject to capture to express their views and recommendations regarding the tax increment financing plan. The authority shall fully inform the taxing jurisdictions about the fiscal and economic implications of the proposed tax increment financing plan. The taxing jurisdictions may present their recommendations at the public hearing on the tax increment financing plan. The authority may enter into agreements with the taxing jurisdictions and the governing body of the municipality in which the authority district is located to share a portion of the captured assessed value of the district or to distribute tax increment revenues among taxing jurisdictions. Upon adoption of the plan, the collection and transmission of the amount of tax increment revenues, as specified in this part, shall be binding on all taxing units levying ad valorem property taxes or specific local taxes against property located in the authority district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Property qualified as a public facility under section 402(ff)(ii) that is acquired by an authority may be sold, conveyed, or otherwise disposed to any person, public or private, for fair market value or reasonable monetary consideration established by the authority with the concurrence of the Michigan economic development corporation and the municipality in which the eligible property is located based on a fair market value appraisal from a fee appraiser only if the property is sold for fair market value. Unless the property acquired by an authority was located within a certified business park, a certified technology park, a certified alternative energy park, or a Next Michigan development area at the time of disposition, an authority shall remit all monetary proceeds received from the sale or disposition of property that qualified as a public facility under section 402(ff)(ii) and was purchased with tax increment revenues to the taxing jurisdictions. Proceeds distributed to taxing jurisdictions shall be remitted in proportion to the amount of tax increment revenues attributable to each taxing jurisdiction in the year the property was acquired. If the property was acquired in part with funds other than tax increment revenues, only that portion of the monetary proceeds received upon disposition that represent the proportion of the cost of acquisition paid with tax increment revenues is required to be remitted to taxing jurisdictions. If the property is located within a certified business park, a certified technology park, or a certified alternative energy park, or a Next Michigan development area at the time of disposition, the monetary proceeds received from the sale or disposition of that property may be retained by the authority for any purpose necessary to further the development program for the certified business park, certified technology park, certified alternative energy park, or Next Michigan development area in accordance with the tax increment financing plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The tax increment financing plan may provide for the use of tax increment revenues from a certified technology park for public facilities for any eligible property located in the certified technology park. The tax increment financing plan may provide for the use of tax increment revenues from a certified alternative energy park for public facilities for any eligible property located in the certified alternative energy park. The tax increment financing plan may provide for the use of tax increment revenues within or without the development area from which the tax increment revenues are derived, provided that the tax increment revenues shall be used for public facilities within a Next Michigan development area within the municipality whose levy has contributed to the tax increment revenues except as otherwise provided in the interlocal agreement creating the Next Michigan development corporation that established the authority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If title to property qualified as a public facility under section 402(ff)(ii) and acquired by an authority with tax increment revenues is sold, conveyed, or otherwise disposed of pursuant to subsection (6) for less than fair market value, the authority shall enter into an agreement relating to the use of the property with the person to whom the property is sold, conveyed, or disposed of, which agreement shall include a penalty provision addressing repayment to the authority if any interest in the property is sold, conveyed, or otherwise disposed of by the person within 12 years after the person received title to the property from the authority. This subsection shall not require enforcement of a penalty provision for a conveyance incident to a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale-lease back transaction, employee stock ownership plan, or other change in corporate or business form or structure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The penalty provision described in subsection (8) shall not be less than an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the property when originally sold, conveyed, or otherwise disposed of and the actual consideration paid by the person to whom the property was originally sold, conveyed, or otherwise disposed of.</div>

An operating license agreement shall include the terms and conditions for operation of the street railway system. An operating license agreement may require the street railway to pay the direct administrative costs incurred by the road authority in administering the operating license agreement. An operating license agreement shall not require a street railway to acquire, accept responsibility for, or obligate itself to assume liability for or pay for any legacy costs of a public transportation provider. Before approving a proposed operating license agreement, a road authority shall hold a public hearing on the proposed operating license agreement.

A road authority may approve or disapprove an operating license agreement. A decision of a road authority regarding an operating license agreement is final and binding upon a street railway and other interested persons. The street railway shall pay a road authority for all of the road authority's costs incurred in constructing the street railway system, mitigating the impact of the street railway system on road users, the environment, and the surrounding neighborhoods, and modifying the streets or highways impacted by construction of the street railway system, as provided in the operating license agreement. As a condition to obtaining or holding an operating license agreement, a road authority shall not require a street railway to obtain any other license or franchise, assess any other fee or charge, or impose any other licensing, regulatory, or franchise requirement, including a provision regulating schedules or fares of a street railway, unless expressly authorized under this part. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the authority determines that it is necessary for the achievement of the purposes of this part, the authority shall prepare and submit a tax increment financing plan to the governing body of the municipality. The plan shall include a development plan as provided in section 621, a detailed explanation of the tax increment procedure, the maximum amount of bonded indebtedness to be incurred, and the duration of the program, and shall be in compliance with section 619. The plan shall contain a statement of the estimated impact of tax increment financing on the assessed values of all taxing jurisdictions in which the development area is located. The plan may provide for the use of part or all of the captured assessed value, but the portion intended to be used by the authority shall be clearly stated in the tax increment financing plan. The authority or municipality may exclude from captured assessed value growth in property value resulting solely from inflation. The plan shall set forth the method for excluding growth in property value resulting solely from inflation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Approval of the tax increment financing plan shall comply with the notice, hearing, and disclosure provisions of section 622. If the development plan is part of the tax increment financing plan, only 1 hearing and approval procedure is required for the 2 plans together.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Before the public hearing on the tax increment financing plan, the governing body shall provide a reasonable opportunity to the taxing jurisdictions levying taxes subject to capture to meet with the governing body. The authority shall fully inform the taxing jurisdictions of the fiscal and economic implications of the proposed development area. The taxing jurisdictions may present their recommendations at the public hearing on the tax increment financing plan. The authority may enter into agreements with the taxing jurisdictions and the governing body of the municipality in which the development area is located to share a portion of the captured assessed value of the development area.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A tax increment financing plan may be modified if the modification is approved by the governing body upon notice and after public hearings and agreements as are required for approval of the original plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except for a development area located in a qualified development area, not more than 60 days after the public hearing on the tax increment financing plan, the governing body in a taxing jurisdiction levying ad valorem property taxes that would otherwise be subject to capture may exempt its taxes from capture by adopting a resolution to that effect and filing a copy with the clerk of the municipality proposing to create the authority. The resolution shall take effect when filed with the clerk and remains effective until a copy of a resolution rescinding that resolution is filed with that clerk. If a separate millage for public library purposes was levied before January 1, 2017, and all obligations of the authority are paid, then the levy is exempt from capture under this part, unless the library board or commission allows all or a portion of its taxes levied to be included as tax increment revenues and subject to capture under this part under the terms of a written agreement between the library board or commission and the authority. The written agreement shall be filed with the clerk of the municipality. However, if a separate millage for public library purposes was levied before January 1, 2017, and the authority alters or amends the boundaries of the development area or extends the duration of the existing finance plan, then the library board or commission may, not later than 60 days after a public hearing is held under this subsection, exempt all or a portion of its taxes from capture by adopting a resolution to that effect and filing a copy with the clerk of the municipality that created the authority. For ad valorem property taxes or specific local taxes attributable to those ad valorem property taxes levied for a separate millage for public library purposes approved by the electors after December 31, 2016, a library board or commission may allow all or a portion of its taxes levied to be included as tax increment revenues and subject to capture under this part under the terms of a written agreement between the library board or commission and the authority. The written agreement shall be filed with the clerk of the municipality. However, if the library was created under section 1 or 10a of 1877 PA 164, MCL 397.201 and 397.210a, or established under 1869 LA 233, then any action of the library board or commission under this subsection shall have the concurrence of the chief executive officer of the city that created the library to be effective.</div>

The municipality may pledge as additional security for the bonds any money received by the authority or the municipality under section 614. The bonds are subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821. Before the municipality may authorize the borrowing, the authority shall submit an estimate of the anticipated tax increment revenues and other revenue available under section 614 to be available for payment of principal and interest on the bonds, to the governing body of the municipality. This estimate shall be approved by the governing body of the municipality by resolution adopted by majority vote of the members of the governing body in the resolution authorizing the bonds. If the governing body of the municipality adopts the resolution authorizing the bonds, the estimate of the anticipated tax increment revenues and other revenue available under section 614 to be available for payment of principal and interest on the bonds shall be conclusive for purposes of this section.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) By resolution of its governing body, the authority may authorize, issue, and sell tax increment bonds subject to the limitations set forth in this subsection to finance the development program of the tax increment financing plan. The tax increment bonds issued by the authority under this subsection shall pledge solely the tax increment revenues of a development area in which the project is located or a development area from which tax increment revenues may be used for this project, or both. In addition or in the alternative, the bonds issued by the authority under this subsection may be secured by any other revenues identified in section 614 as sources of financing for activities of the authority that the authority shall specifically pledge in the resolution. However, the full faith and credit of the municipality shall not be pledged to secure bonds issued under this subsection. The bond issue may include a sum sufficient to pay interest on the tax increment bonds until full development of tax increment revenues from the project and also a sum to provide a reasonable reserve for payment of principal and interest on the bonds. The resolution authorizing the bonds shall create a lien on the tax increment revenues and other revenues pledged by the resolution that shall be a statutory lien and shall be a first lien subject only to liens previously created. The resolution may provide the terms upon which additional bonds may be issued of equal standing and parity of lien as to the tax increment revenues and other revenues pledged under the resolution. Bonds issued under this subsection that pledge revenue received under section 615 for repayment of the bonds are subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the authority determines that it is necessary for the achievement of the purposes of this part, the authority shall prepare and submit a tax increment financing plan to the governing body of the municipality. The plan shall include a development plan as provided in section 718, a detailed explanation of the tax increment procedure, the maximum amount of bonded indebtedness to be incurred, and the duration of the program, and shall be in compliance with section 716. The plan shall contain a statement of the estimated impact of tax increment financing on the assessed values of all taxing jurisdictions in which the development area is located. The plan may provide for the use of part or all of the captured assessed value, but the portion intended to be used by the authority shall be clearly stated in the tax increment financing plan. The authority or municipality may exclude from captured assessed value growth in property value resulting solely from inflation. The plan shall set forth the method for excluding growth in property value resulting solely from inflation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Approval of the tax increment financing plan shall comply with the notice, hearing, and disclosure provisions of section 821. If the development plan is part of the tax increment financing plan, only 1 hearing and approval procedure is required for the 2 plans together.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Before the public hearing on the tax increment financing plan, the governing body shall provide a reasonable opportunity to the taxing jurisdictions levying taxes subject to capture to meet with the governing body. The authority shall fully inform the taxing jurisdictions of the fiscal and economic implications of the proposed development area. The taxing jurisdictions may present their recommendations at the public hearing on the tax increment financing plan. The authority may enter into agreements with the taxing jurisdictions and the governing body of the municipality in which the development area is located to share a portion of the captured assessed value of the development area.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A tax increment financing plan may be modified if the modification is approved by the governing body upon notice and after public hearings and agreements as are required for approval of the original plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Not more than 60 days after the public hearing, the governing body in a taxing jurisdiction levying ad valorem property taxes that would otherwise be subject to capture may exempt its taxes from capture by adopting a resolution to that effect and filing a copy with the clerk of the municipality proposing to create the authority. In the event that the governing body levies a separate millage for public library purposes, at the request of the public library board, that separate millage shall be exempt from the capture. The resolution shall take effect when filed with the clerk and remains effective until a copy of a resolution rescinding that resolution is filed with that clerk. If a separate millage for public library purposes was levied before January 1, 2017, and all obligations of the authority are paid, then the levy is exempt from capture under this part, unless the library board or commission allows all or a portion of its taxes levied to be included as tax increment revenues and subject to capture under this part under the terms of a written agreement between the library board or commission and the authority. The written agreement shall be filed with the clerk of the municipality. However, if a separate millage for public library purposes was levied before January 1, 2017, and the authority alters or amends the boundaries of the district or extends the duration of the existing finance plan, then the library board or commission may, not later than 60 days after a public hearing is held under this subsection, exempt all or a portion of its taxes from capture by adopting a resolution to that effect and filing a copy with the clerk of the municipality that created the authority. For ad valorem property taxes or specific local taxes attributable to those ad valorem property taxes levied for a separate millage for public library purposes approved by the electors after December 31, 2016, a library board or commission may allow all or a portion of its taxes levied to be included as tax increment revenues and subject to capture under this part under the terms of a written agreement between the library board or commission and the authority. The written agreement shall be filed with the clerk of the municipality. However, if the library was created under section 1 or 10a of 1877 PA 164, MCL 397.201 and 397.210a, or established under 1869 LA 233, then any action of the library board or commission under this subsection shall have the concurrence of the chief executive officer of the city that created the library to be effective.</div>

In addition or in the alternative, the bonds issued by the authority under this subsection may be secured by any other revenues identified in section 712 as sources of financing for activities of the authority that the authority shall specifically pledge in the resolution. However, except as otherwise provided in this section, the full faith and credit of the municipality shall not be pledged to secure bonds issued under this subsection. The bond issue may include a sum sufficient to pay interest on the tax increment bonds until full development of tax increment revenues from the project and also a sum to provide a reasonable reserve for payment of principal and interest on the bonds. The resolution authorizing the bonds shall create a lien on the tax increment revenues and other revenues pledged by the resolution that shall be a statutory lien and shall be a first lien subject only to liens previously created. The resolution may provide the terms upon which additional bonds may be issued of equal standing and parity of lien as to the tax increment revenues and other revenues pledged under the resolution. Bonds issued under this subsection that pledge revenue received under section 715 for repayment of the bonds are subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The municipality, by majority vote of the members of its governing body, may make a limited tax pledge to support the authority's tax increment bonds or notes or, if authorized by the voters of the municipality, may pledge its unlimited tax full faith and credit for the payment of the principal of and interest on the authority's tax increment bonds or notes.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the authority determines that it is necessary for the achievement of the purposes of this part, the authority shall prepare and submit a tax increment financing plan to the governing body of the municipality. The plan shall include a development plan as provided in section 816, a detailed explanation of the tax increment procedure, the maximum amount of bonded indebtedness to be incurred, and the duration of the program, and shall be in compliance with section 815. The plan shall contain a statement of the estimated impact of tax increment financing on the assessed values of all taxing jurisdictions in which the development area is located. The plan may provide for the use of part or all of the captured assessed value, but the portion intended to be used by the authority shall be clearly stated in the tax increment financing plan. The authority or municipality may exclude from captured assessed value growth in property value resulting solely from inflation. The plan shall set forth the method for excluding growth in property value resulting solely from inflation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Approval of the tax increment financing plan shall comply with the notice, hearing, and disclosure provisions of section 818. If the development plan is part of the tax increment financing plan, only 1 hearing and approval procedure is required for the 2 plans together.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Before the public hearing on the tax increment financing plan, the governing body shall provide a reasonable opportunity to the taxing jurisdictions levying taxes subject to capture to meet with the governing body. The authority shall fully inform the taxing jurisdictions of the fiscal and economic implications of the proposed development area. The taxing jurisdictions may present their recommendations at the public hearing on the tax increment financing plan. The authority may enter into agreements with the taxing jurisdictions and the governing body of the municipality in which the development area is located to share a portion of the captured assessed value of the development area.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Not more than 60 days after the public hearing, the governing body in a taxing jurisdiction levying ad valorem property taxes that would otherwise be subject to capture may exempt its taxes from capture by adopting a resolution to that effect and filing a copy with the clerk of the municipality proposing to create the authority. In the event that the governing body levies a separate millage for public library purposes, at the request of the public library board, that separate millage shall be exempt from the capture. The resolution shall take effect when filed with the clerk and remains effective until a copy of a resolution rescinding that resolution is filed with that clerk. If a separate millage for public library purposes was levied before January 1, 2017, and all obligations of the authority are paid, then the levy is exempt from capture under this part, unless the library board or commission allows all or a portion of its taxes levied to be included as tax increment revenues and subject to capture under this part under the terms of a written agreement between the library board or commission and the authority. The written agreement shall be filed with the clerk of the municipality. However, if a separate millage for public library purposes was levied before January 1, 2017, and the authority alters or amends the boundaries of a development area or extends the duration of the existing finance plan, then the library board or commission may, not later than 60 days after a public hearing is held under this subsection, exempt all or a portion of its taxes from capture by adopting a resolution to that effect and filing a copy with the clerk of the municipality that created the authority. For ad valorem property taxes or specific local taxes attributable to those ad valorem property taxes levied for a separate millage for public library purposes approved by the electors after December 31, 2016, a library board or commission may allow all or a portion of its taxes levied to be included as tax increment revenues and subject to capture under this part under the terms of a written agreement between the library board or commission and the authority. The written agreement shall be filed with the clerk of the municipality. However, if the library was created under section 1 or 10a of 1877 PA 164, MCL 397.201 and 397.210a, or established under 1869 LA 233, then any action of the library board or commission under this subsection shall have the concurrence of the chief executive officer of the city that created the library to be effective.</div>
