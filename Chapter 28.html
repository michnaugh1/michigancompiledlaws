<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The county sheriff or the investigating law enforcement agency as ordered by the court shall provide for collecting the samples required to be provided under subsection (1) in a medically approved manner by qualified persons using supplies provided by the department and shall forward those samples and any samples described in subsection (1) that were already in the agency's possession to the department after the individual from whom the sample was taken has been arraigned in the district court.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That, except as otherwise provided by law, the individual's DNA sample or DNA identification profile, or both, shall be destroyed or expunged, as appropriate, if the charge for which the sample was obtained has been dismissed or resulted in acquittal, or no charge was filed within the limitations period. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That the individual's DNA sample or DNA identification profile, or both, will not be destroyed or expunged, as appropriate, if the department determines that the individual from whom the sample is taken is otherwise obligated to submit a sample or if it is evidence relating to another individual that would otherwise be retained under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) That the burden is on the arresting law enforcement agency and the prosecution to request the destruction or expunction of a DNA sample or DNA identification profile as required under this section, not on the individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The court shall order each individual found responsible for or convicted of 1 or more crimes listed in subsection (1) to pay an assessment of $60.00.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the department shall permanently retain a DNA identification profile of an individual obtained from a sample in the manner prescribed by the department under this act if any of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The individual is arrested for committing or attempting to commit a felony offense or an offense that would be a felony offense if committed by an adult.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The individual is convicted of or found responsible for a felony or attempted felony, or any of the following misdemeanors, or local ordinances that are substantially corresponding to the following misdemeanors:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A violation of section 167(1)(c), (f), or (i) of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.167, disorderly person by window peeping, engaging in indecent or obscene conduct in public, or loitering in a house of ill fame or prostitution.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) A violation of section 454 of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.454, leasing a house for purposes of prostitution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The DNA identification profiles of DNA samples received under this act must only be disclosed as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) To a criminal justice agency for law enforcement identification purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) In a judicial proceeding as authorized or required by a court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) To a defendant in a criminal case if the DNA identification profile is used in conjunction with a charge against the defendant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) For an academic, research, statistical analysis, or protocol developmental purpose only if personal identifications are removed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Notwithstanding subsection (1), if at the time the individual is arrested, convicted of, or found responsible for the violation the investigating law enforcement agency or the department already has a sample from the individual that meets the requirements of this act, the individual is not required to provide another sample or pay the assessment required under subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The county sheriff or the investigating law enforcement agency as ordered by the court shall provide for collecting the samples required to be provided under subsection (1) in a medically approved manner by qualified persons using supplies provided by the department and shall forward those samples and any samples described in subsection (1) that were already in the agency's possession to the department after the individual from whom the sample was taken has been arraigned in the district court. However, the individual's DNA sample must not be forwarded to the department if the individual is not charged with committing or attempting to commit a felony offense or an offense that would be a felony if committed by an adult. If the individual's DNA sample is forwarded to the department despite the individual not having been charged as described in this subsection, the law enforcement agency shall notify the department to destroy that sample. The collecting and forwarding of samples must be done in the manner required under this act. A sample must be collected by the county sheriff or the investigating law enforcement agency after arrest but before sentencing or disposition as ordered by the court and promptly transmitted to the department of state police after the individual is charged with committing or attempting to commit a felony offense or an offense that would be a felony if committed by an adult. This subsection does not preclude a law enforcement agency or state agency from obtaining a sample at or after sentencing or disposition. At the time a DNA sample is taken from an individual under this section, the individual must be notified in writing of all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That, except as otherwise provided by law, the individual's DNA sample or DNA identification profile, or both, must be destroyed or expunged, as appropriate, if the charge for which the sample was obtained has been dismissed or resulted in acquittal, or no charge was filed within the limitations period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That the individual's DNA sample or DNA identification profile, or both, will not be destroyed or expunged, as appropriate, if the department determines that the individual from whom the sample is taken is otherwise obligated to submit a sample or if it is evidence relating to another individual that would otherwise be retained under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) That the burden is on the arresting law enforcement agency and the prosecution to request the destruction or expunction of a DNA sample or DNA identification profile as required under this section, not on the individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The court shall order each individual found responsible for or convicted of 1 or more crimes listed in subsection (1) to pay an assessment of $60.00. The assessment required under this subsection is in addition to any fine, costs, or other assessments imposed by the court. This subsection does not apply to a juvenile, or a parent, guardian, or legal custodian of a juvenile, within the jurisdiction of the court under section 2 of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.2.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An assessment required under subsection (5) must be ordered on the record and must be listed separately in the adjudication order, judgment of sentence, or order of probation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) After reviewing a verified petition by an individual against whom an assessment is imposed under subsection (5), the court may suspend payment of all or part of the assessment if it determines the individual is unable to pay the assessment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The court that imposes the assessment prescribed under subsection (5) may retain 10% of all assessments or portions of assessments collected for costs incurred under this section and shall transmit that money to its funding unit.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If a sample was collected under subsection (1) from an individual who does not have more than 1 conviction, and that conviction was reversed by an appellate court, the sentencing court shall order the disposal of the sample collected and DNA identification profile record for that conviction in the manner provided in subsections (12) and (13).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Any other DNA identification profile obtained by the department must not be permanently retained by the department but must be retained only as long as it is needed for a criminal investigation or criminal prosecution. Except as provided in subsection (11), the state police forensic laboratory shall dispose of a DNA sample collected under subsection (1) or a DNA identification profile, or both, if any of the following circumstances occur:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The department receives a written request for disposal and a certified copy of a final court order establishing that the charge for which the sample was obtained has been dismissed or has resulted in an acquittal or that no charge was filed within the applicable limitations period.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The department determines that the individual from whom the sample is taken has otherwise become obligated to submit a sample.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Subsection (15) applies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The state police forensic laboratory shall dispose of a sample and a DNA identification profile record in the following manner:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Not more than 60 days after the department receives notice under subsection (10), the laboratory shall dispose of the sample in compliance with section 13811 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.13811.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The laboratory shall dispose of the sample and the DNA identification profile record in the presence of a witness.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) After disposal in accordance with subsection (12), the laboratory shall make and keep a written record of the disposal, signed by the individual who witnessed the disposal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) An identification, warrant, detention, probable cause to arrest, arrest, or conviction based upon a DNA match or DNA information is not invalidated if it is later determined that 1 or more of the following errors occurred in good faith:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A DNA sample was erroneously obtained.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A DNA identification profile was erroneously retained.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A DNA sample was not disposed of or there was a delay in disposing of the sample.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A DNA identification profile was not disposed of or there was a delay in disposing of the profile.</div>

The seizing entity or its agents shall not destroy, sell, or use a firearm seized under this subsection until 30 days have passed since the heir or devisee has been notified of the seizure and no legal action regarding the lawful possession or ownership of the seized firearm has been filed in any court and is pending.

An individual who violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 90 days or a fine of not more than $100.00, or both.</div>

A county clerk shall only issue an emergency license to carry a concealed pistol to an individual who has obtained a personal protection order if the individual is eligible under section 5b(7)(d), (e), (f), (h), (i), (j), (k), and (m) to receive a license based on a criminal record check through the law enforcement information network conducted by the department of state police. The county sheriff shall only issue a determination under this subsection to an individual who is eligible under section 5b(7)(d), (e), (f), (h), (i), (j), (k), and (m) to receive a license based on a criminal record check through the law enforcement information network and only after the county sheriff has taken the individual's fingerprints in compliance with section 5b(9). A county sheriff shall notify the county clerk if the county sheriff determines that an individual is not eligible under section 5b(7)(d), (e), (f), (h), (i), (j), (k), or (m) to receive a license. An emergency license must be on a form provided by the department of state police. An individual who applies for an emergency license shall, within 10 business days after applying for an emergency license, complete a pistol training course under section 5j and apply for a license under section 5b. If an individual who applies for an emergency license does not complete a pistol training course under section 5j and apply for a license under section 5b within 10 business days after applying for an emergency license, that individual's emergency license is no longer valid. A county sheriff who makes a determination under this section, performs a criminal record check, and takes the applicant's fingerprints may charge a fee not to exceed $15.00. A county clerk may charge a fee not to exceed $10.00 for printing an emergency license. A county clerk shall deposit a fee collected by the county clerk under this subsection in the concealed pistol licensing fund of that county created in section 5x. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an emergency license is valid for 45 days or until the county clerk issues a notice of statutory disqualification, whichever occurs first. Except as otherwise provided in this act, an emergency license is, for all other purposes of this act, a license to carry a concealed pistol. The county clerk shall include an indication on the license if an individual is exempt from the prohibitions against carrying a concealed pistol on premises described in section 5o if the applicant provides acceptable proof that he or she qualifies for that exemption. An individual shall not obtain more than 1 emergency license in any 5-year period. If a county clerk issues a notice of statutory disqualification to an applicant who received an emergency license under this section, the applicant shall immediately surrender the emergency license to the county clerk by mail or in person if that emergency license has not expired. An individual who fails to surrender a license as required by this subsection after he or she is notified of a statutory disqualification is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $500.00, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The legislative service bureau shall compile the firearms laws of this state, including laws that apply to carrying a concealed pistol, and shall provide copies of the compilation in an electronic format to the department of state police. The department of state police shall provide a copy of the compiled laws to each county clerk in this state. The department of state police shall also provide forms to appeal any notice of statutory disqualification, or suspension or revocation of a license under this act. The department of state police shall distribute copies of the compilation and forms required under this subsection in an electronic format to each county clerk. The county clerk shall distribute a copy of the compilation and forms at no charge to each individual who applies for a license to carry a concealed pistol at the time the application is submitted. The county clerk may distribute copies of the compilation and forms required under this subsection in an electronic format. The county clerk shall require the applicant to sign a written statement acknowledging that he or she has received a copy of the compilation and forms provided under this subsection. An individual is not eligible to receive a license to carry a concealed pistol until he or she has signed the statement.</div>

Within 5 business days after completing the verification under subsection (6), the department shall send the county clerk a list of an individual's statutory disqualifications under this act. Except as provided in section 5a(4), the county clerk shall not issue a concealed pistol license until the county clerk receives the report of statutory disqualifications prescribed in this subsection. If an individual's fingerprints are not classifiable, the department of state police shall, at no charge, take the individual's fingerprints again or provide for the comparisons under this subsection to be conducted through alternative means. The county clerk shall not issue a notice of statutory disqualification because an individual's fingerprints are not classifiable by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The county clerk shall send by first-class mail a notice of statutory disqualification for a license under this act to an individual if the individual is not qualified under subsection (7) to receive that license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A license to carry a concealed pistol that is issued based upon an application that contains a material false statement is void from the date the license is issued.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Subject to subsection (10), the department of state police shall complete the verification required under subsection (6) and the county clerk shall issue a license or a notice of statutory disqualification not later than 45 days after the date the individual has classifiable fingerprints taken under subsection (9). The county clerk shall include an indication on the license if an individual is exempt from the prohibitions against carrying a concealed pistol on premises described in section 5o if the applicant provides acceptable proof that the applicant qualifies for that exemption. If the county clerk receives notice from a county sheriff or chief law enforcement officer that a licensee is no longer a member of a sheriff's posse, an auxiliary officer, or a reserve officer, the county clerk shall notify the licensee that the licensee shall surrender the concealed pistol license indicating that the individual is exempt from the prohibitions against carrying a concealed pistol on premises described in section 5o. The licensee shall, not later than 30 days after receiving notice from the county clerk, surrender the license indicating that the individual is exempt from the prohibitions against carrying a concealed pistol on premises described in section 5o and obtain a replacement license after paying the fee required under subsection (15). If the county clerk issues a notice of statutory disqualification, the county clerk shall, not later than 5 business days after that notice, do all of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A statement of each statutory disqualification identified.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Inform the individual that the individual should contact the source of the record for any statutory disqualification to correct any errors in the record resulting in the statutory disqualification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) If a license or notice of statutory disqualification is not issued under subsection (13) within 45 days after the date the individual has classifiable fingerprints taken under subsection (9), the receipt issued under subsection (9) serves as a concealed pistol license for purposes of this act when carried with a state-issued driver license or personal identification card and is valid until a license or notice of statutory disqualification is issued by the county clerk.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) If an individual licensed under this act to carry a concealed pistol moves to a different county within this state, the individual's license remains valid until it expires or is otherwise suspended or revoked under this act. An individual may notify a county clerk that the individual has moved to a different address within this state for the purpose of receiving the notice under section 5l(1). A license to carry a concealed pistol that is lost, stolen, defaced, or replaced for any other reason may be replaced by the issuing county clerk for a replacement fee of $10.00. A county clerk shall deposit a replacement fee under this subsection in the concealed pistol licensing fund of that county created in section 5x.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) If a license issued under this act is suspended or revoked, the license is forfeited and the individual shall return the license to the county clerk forthwith by mail or in person.

The county clerk shall notify the department of state police if a license is suspended or revoked. The department of state police shall enter that suspension or revocation into the law enforcement information network.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) An applicant or an individual licensed under this act to carry a concealed pistol may be furnished a copy of the individual's application under this section upon request and the payment of a reasonable fee not to exceed $1.00. The county clerk shall deposit any fee collected under this subsection in the concealed pistol licensing fund of that county created in section 5x.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) This section does not prohibit the county clerk from making public and distributing to the public at no cost lists of individuals who are certified as qualified instructors as prescribed under section 5j.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) A county clerk issuing an initial license or renewal license under this act shall mail the license to the licensee by first-class mail in a sealed envelope. Upon payment of the fee under subsection (15), a county clerk shall issue a replacement license in person at the time of application for a replacement license. A county clerk may also deliver a replacement license by first-class mail if the individual submits to the clerk a written request and a copy of the individual's state-issued driver license or personal identification card.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) A county clerk, county sheriff, county prosecuting attorney, police department, or the department of state police is not liable for civil damages as a result of issuing a license under this act to an individual who later commits a crime or a negligent act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) An individual licensed under this act to carry a concealed pistol may voluntarily surrender that license without explanation.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The county clerk in the county in which a license was issued to an individual to carry a concealed pistol shall suspend, revoke, or reinstate a license as required under this act if ordered by a court or if the county clerk is notified by a law enforcement agency, prosecuting official, or court of a change in the licensee's eligibility to carry a concealed pistol under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a county clerk is notified by a law enforcement agency, prosecuting official, or court that an individual licensed to carry a concealed pistol is charged with a felony or charged with a misdemeanor listed in section 5b(7)(h) or (i), the county clerk shall immediately suspend the individual's license until there is a final disposition of the charge for that offense.

The notice must include the statutory reason for the suspension, the source of the record supporting that suspension, the length of the suspension, and whom to contact for reinstating the license on expiration of the suspension, correcting errors in the record, or appealing the suspension. If a county clerk suspended a license under this subsection and the individual is acquitted of the charge or the charge is dismissed, the individual shall notify the county clerk who shall automatically reinstate the license if the license is not expired and the individual is otherwise qualified to receive a license to carry a concealed pistol, as verified by the department of state police. A county clerk shall not charge a fee for the reinstatement of a license under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The department of state police shall notify the county clerk in the county in which a license was issued to an individual to carry a concealed pistol if the department of state police determines that there has been a change in the individual's eligibility under this act to receive a license to carry a concealed pistol. The county clerk shall suspend, revoke, or reinstate the license as required under this act and immediately send notice of the suspension, revocation, or reinstatement under this subsection by first-class mail in a sealed envelope to the individual's last known address as indicated on the records of the county clerk. The notice must include the statutory reason for the suspension, revocation, or reinstatement, the source of the record supporting the suspension, revocation, or reinstatement, the length of the suspension or revocation, and whom to contact for correcting errors in the record, appealing the suspension or revocation, and reapplying for that individual's license.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a suspension is imposed under this section, the suspension must be for a period stated in years, months, or days, or until the final disposition of the charge, and state the date the suspension will end, if applicable. The licensee shall promptly surrender the individual's license to the county clerk after being notified that the individual's license has been revoked or suspended. An individual who fails to surrender a license as required under this subsection after the individual was notified that the individual's license was suspended or revoked is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $500.00, or both.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The name of the county in which the receipt is issued, if applicable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) An impression of the county seal, if applicable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a license is suspended because of an order under section 5b(7)(d)(iii) or 5b(7)(d)(vi) and that license was surrendered by the licensee, upon expiration of the order and notification to the county clerk, the county clerk shall automatically reinstate the license if the license is not expired and the department of state police has completed the verification required under section 5b(6). The county clerk shall not charge a fee for the reinstatement of a license under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the court orders a county clerk to suspend, revoke, or reinstate a license under this section or amends a suspension, revocation, or reinstatement order, the county clerk shall immediately notify the department of state police in a manner prescribed by the department of state police. The department of state police shall enter the order or amended order into the law enforcement information network. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A suspension or revocation order or amended order issued under this section is immediately effective. However, an individual is not criminally liable for violating the order or amended order unless the individual has received notice of the order or amended order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If an individual is carrying a pistol in violation of a suspension or revocation order or amended order issued under this section but has not previously received notice of the order or amended order, the individual must be informed of the order or amended order and be given an opportunity to properly store the pistol or otherwise comply with the order or amended order before an arrest is made for carrying the pistol in violation of this act.</div>

Beginning on the effective date of the 2018 act that added this sentence and notwithstanding the NFPA 1124 requirements regarding automatic sprinkler systems, if the retail location is in a permanent multitenant building or structure, the building or structure must be equipped with an automatic sprinkler system. The requirement for an automatic sprinkler system described in this subdivision does not apply to the retail location of a person that held a consumer fireworks certificate for a retail location of the same address in a permanent building or structure during the calendar year before the effective date of the 2018 act that added this sentence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The retailer at that retail location is licensed under section 3 of the general sales tax act, 1933 PA 167, MCL 205.53.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The retailer has a valid federal taxpayer identification number. This requirement does not apply to a retailer that is a sole proprietorship.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A person that fails or neglects to comply with subsection (1) is responsible for a civil fine of not more than $2,500.00 for each violation. The department shall determine the amount of the fine imposed under this subsection by applying a scale, as developed by the department, that reflects the severity of the violation. Each day that a person is in noncompliance is a separate violation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) During any period of time in which a person is selling consumer fireworks, the person shall add as an additional insured, or obtain and maintain public liability and product liability insurance coverage for, each retail location at which the person is selling consumer fireworks, in an amount not less than $10,000,000.00 per occurrence. If the department determines that a person has failed or neglected to comply with this subsection, the department shall order the person to immediately cease operations and pay a civil fine of not more than $5,000.00. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A retailer shall provide with every purchase of consumer fireworks a notice listing the dates and times permitted under this act for the ignition, discharge, and use of consumer fireworks. The notice shall begin with the following statement: "State law permits, under MCL 28.457, the ignition, discharge, and use of consumer fireworks at the following times:". The retailer may provide the notice in a form and manner determined by the retailer, including, but not limited to, printing or stamping the notice on, or affixing the notice to, a receipt, bag, or the product being purchased, or a printed handout provided at the time of purchase. Posting the notice on a wall, window, display, or otherwise, at the retail location, does not satisfy the requirements of this subsection. A retailer who fails to provide the notice required by this subsection is responsible for a civil fine of $100.00 for each day on which 1 or more violations occur. The department shall provide for the remittance of the fine collected under this subsection to the local law enforcement agency responsible for enforcing the notice requirement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A person shall not engage in the retail sale of consumer fireworks over the telephone, internet, or other like manner unless the consumer fireworks are picked up or shipped from a permanent location for which the person holds a valid consumer fireworks certificate.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Effective policing that promotes safety, security, and justice for all Michiganders requires participation in setting policing standards from a broad range of individuals, including Michigan residents from outside the law enforcement community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Adding members to the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards, which develops the licensing and training standards for law enforcement officers in this state, will bring a more diverse range of voices to this important task and promote democratic accountability.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Section 1 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 vests the executive power of the State of Michigan in the governor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Section 2 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 empowers the governor to make changes in the organization of the executive branch of state government or in the assignment of functions among its units that the governor considers necessary for efficient administration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Acting under the Michigan Constitution of 1963 and Michigan law, I order the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>1. The Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards (the Commission) created by section 3 of the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards Act (the MCOLES Act), 1965 PA 203, as amended, MCL 28.603, is expanded to include the following additional members:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The director of the Michigan Department of Civil Rights, or his or her designated representative from within that department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Three residents of this state appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Michigan Senate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>2. A member appointed under section 1(b) of this order must not be a law enforcement officer, a Michigan tribal law enforcement officer, or be employed by or otherwise affiliated with a law enforcement agency or a law enforcement training academy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>3. Of the Commission members initially appointed under section 1(b) of this order, one must be appointed for an initial term expiring on December 31, 2021, one must be appointed for an initial term expiring on December 31, 2022, and one must be appointed for an initial term expiring on December 31, 2023. After the initial term, the members will be appointed for terms of four years. A vacancy occurring other than by expiration of a term will be filled in the same manner as the original appointment for the remainder of the unexpired term.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>4. As used in this order, "law enforcement agency", "law enforcement officer", "law enforcement training academy", and "Michigan tribal law enforcement officer" mean those terms as defined in section 2 of the MCOLES Act, MCL 28.602.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>

The individual is not required to report under this subsection if he or she had a digitized photograph taken for an operator's or chauffeur's license or official state personal identification card before January 1, 2000, or within 2 years before he or she is released unless his or her appearance has changed from the date of that photograph. Unless the person is a nonresident, the photograph must be used on the individual's operator's or chauffeur's license or official state personal identification card.
