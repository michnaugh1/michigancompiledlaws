In a county having a population of 750,000 or more with a charter commission proposing a charter under 1966 PA 293, MCL 45.501 to 45.521, the powers and duties that are otherwise provided by law for a board of county road commissioners may be reorganized under the charter if, at the election considering the approval of the charter, the voters approve both the charter and a separate ballot question presented by the charter commission to reorganize the board of county road commissioners. Funds provided to the county under 1951 PA 51, MCL 247.651 to 247.675, must only be expended for the purposes provided under 1951 PA 51, MCL 247.651 to 247.675.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the county board of commissioners proposes to alter the number of county road commissioners as allowed under this act, the county board of commissioners shall hold not less than 1 public hearing on the proposed change to the road commission. The county board of commissioners shall give notice as required under the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275, of the time and place of the public hearing not less than 28 days before the hearing.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5) and subject to the requirement provided in subsection (9), the county board of commissioners in a county with an elected board of county road commissioners may, by a resolution as allowed under section 11 of 1851 PA 156, MCL 46.11, submit to the qualified and registered electors of the county at the next regular election to be held in the county the question of transferring the powers, duties, and functions of the elected board of county road commissioners of that county to the county board of commissioners. If a majority of the qualified and registered electors of the county voting on the question vote in favor of transferring the powers, duties, and functions of the elected board of county road commissioners of that county to the county board of commissioners, the elected board of county road commissioners of that county is dissolved and the county board of commissioners is authorized to receive and expend funds as allowed under 1951 PA 51, MCL 247.651 to 247.675.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Before adopting a resolution under subsection (7) or (8), the county board of commissioners shall conduct, at a minimum, 2 public hearings on whether to transfer the powers, duties, and functions of the board of county road commissioners to the county board of commissioners.</div>

<P>Sec. 17.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The boards of county road commissioners of adjoining counties may unite in laying out and establishing a county road on or near the line between their counties; may institute proceedings to acquire the lands for the road; and may construct and maintain the road at the joint expense of the counties. Should a part of the line road become abandoned, or should the division of the line road between the counties for opening, improvement, and maintenance become unjust and inequitable, on the written application of 7 or more property owners of either county, or on application of the state highway commission addressed to the county road commissioners of a county, the commissioners to whom the application is made within 5 days after receipt of the application, shall notify the county road commission of the adjoining interested county. Each commission shall appoint as arbitrator 1 of its members, and the 2 shall jointly appoint a time and place of hearing. The hearing shall not be less than 10 nor more than 20 days after the receipt of the application. The business which the arbitrators may perform shall be conducted at a public meeting of the arbitrators held in compliance with Act No. 267 of the Public Acts of 1976. Public notice of the time, date, and place of the hearing shall be posted in 3 public places in the county affected in the manner required by Act No. 267 of the Public Acts of 1976. The hearing may be adjourned, but for not more than 20 days. At a hearing the arbitrators shall jointly determine whether the former division of the road is just and equitable, and if not, shall determine and allot what portion of road shall be improved and maintained by either of the counties. The allotment shall take effect immediately. Should the arbitrators be unable to agree, they shall adjourn the hearing, and on the adjourned day associate with themselves a county road commissioner of another immediately adjoining county. Should the 2 arbitrators be unable to agree on the third arbitrator, on notification of the state highway commission by the county road commission to which application for redivision has been made that they are unable to agree on the third arbitrator, the state highway commission shall appoint a third disinterested party, and the 3 shall determine the questions by majority vote. When a line road or bridge has been laid out or established, and the county road commissions refuse or neglect to construct or maintain their designated portion of the road in a manner reasonably safe and fit for public travel, the state highway commission, on a petition of 7 property owners of either county, shall inspect the merits of the petition. If the state highway commission decides with the petitioners, the state highway commission shall direct the county road commission to which the road or bridge belongs to construct and maintain the road or bridge, and in default shall be authorized to cause the road to be placed in condition safe and fit for public travel and pay for cost out of the highway fund, reimbursing the fund by appropriate deduction from the next installment of weight and gasoline tax refunds due the county or counties.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 18.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If state reward is to be applied for, the board of county road commissioners shall file with the state transportation commission, for its approval, a map of the county showing the location of the proposed system of county roads. This proposed system may be changed if approved by the state transportation commission. All state rewarded roads composing a part of this system shall be taken over as county roads by the board of county road commissioners and any road or part of a road previously laid out shall become a county road if the board of county road commissioners shall at any time so determine, and in passing through or on the line between townships or villages or cities any streets or parts of streets may be adopted as a county road, with the consent of the proper authorities of that city or cities, village or villages. If a street is taken over and improved as a county road, city and village authorities may further improve the road by surfacing it outside the portion constructed by the county and by the addition of gutters, curbs, sidewalks, and other improvements, may provide for the care and maintenance of the improvements, and may levy and collect taxes for the improvements. The vote of the county road commissioners in respect to the determination shall be taken by yeas and nays, and shall be entered at large on the records of the board of county road commissioners. Notice of the determination shall be immediately given by the clerk to the highway authorities of each city or village in which the road or any part of the road is situated, and published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, once in each week for 3 successive weeks. Proof of service and publication may be made by affidavit by any person knowing the facts and filed with the clerk. The affidavit or the record thereof or certified copy of the affidavit or record shall be prima facie evidence of its contents. After service and publication of the notice, the board of county road commissioners shall have exclusive jurisdiction and control of the road embraced within the determination, and the municipality within which the road is situated shall be relieved from all responsibility for the road. Immediately after laying out or taking control of a road the board shall give the road a name. The board may change the name of the road if it determines that a name change is necessary in order to conform to a general plan or avoid confusion or duplication. The name given by the board to any road under its jurisdiction, either originally or in case of a change as provided for in this section, is the official name by which the road shall be known.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The board also may enter into agreements with the board of county road commissioners in any adjoining county with reference to the laying out, maintenance, construction, and improvement of inter-county roads. The decision of each board to become a party to an agreement is limited to the construction, improvement, or maintenance of the portion of the road subject to the jurisdiction of that board.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The board of county road commissioners of any county that has adopted the county road system, at any time, may either relinquish jurisdiction of or absolutely abandon and discontinue any county road, or any part of a county road, by a resolution adopted by a majority vote. The vote of the county road commissioners in respect to either relinquishment of jurisdiction or absolute abandonment and discontinuance shall be taken and entered, and notice given, in the same manner as required in this section in cases in which county roads are adopted. After proceedings to relinquish jurisdiction have been had, the jurisdiction and control of the road, or part of the road, except as otherwise provided in this section, shall revert to the municipality within which the road is situated, and the county shall be relieved of the responsibility for the road. After proceedings to abandon absolutely and discontinue, the road or part of the road shall cease to exist as a public highway unless the unit of government that acquires the property or control of the property permits use as a public highway. Subject to subsection (8), the board, at the time of the passage of a resolution to abandon absolutely and discontinue any portion of a highway under its jurisdiction, shall determine in the resolution that it is in the best interests of the public that the highway or portion of the highway be absolutely abandoned and discontinued. The board shall cause a true copy of every resolution or other proceeding containing an accurate description of the lands comprising the highway or portion of the highway that has been absolutely abandoned and discontinued to be recorded in the office of the register of deeds for the county where the lands are situated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The board of county road commissioners shall not absolutely abandon and discontinue any highway, or part of a highway, except as provided in this section, upon the written petition of 7 or more freeholders of the township in which the road is sought to be absolutely abandoned and discontinued. The petition for absolutely abandoning and discontinuing a highway shall describe the road in general terms or by any name by which it is known, and if the absolute abandonment and discontinuance of only a portion of a road is asked for, that portion shall be specified. The petition shall be accompanied by a true and correct list of the names and mailing addresses of the occupants of each parcel of land abutting the highway, or portion of the highway, sought to be absolutely abandoned and discontinued, which list shall be certified to under oath by 1 of the persons making or presenting the petition.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a petition for absolute abandonment and discontinuance of a road or portion of a road contains the signatures of all of the owners of record and occupants of land abutting the road, as ascertained from the records in the office of the register of deeds and the certified list provided for in subsection (4), the board of county road commissioners shall, within 20 days after receiving the petition, subject to subsection (8), determine the advisability of the abandonment and discontinuance and either grant or deny the petition without further proceedings. In all other cases the board shall, within 20 days after receiving a petition, issue a written notice stating the object of the petition and appointing a time and place of hearing, which notice shall be served on the township board of the township in which the road is situated and on the owners of record and occupants of lands through or adjoining which it is proposed to absolutely abandon and discontinue the road, by mailing a copy of the notice by first-class mail to the township board of the township in which the road is situated and to the residence of each owner of record or occupant at his or her last known address at least 30 days before the time of hearing. The township board of the township in which the road is situated shall have first priority to retain the property or portion of the property. The board shall also notify the township or municipality within which the road is situated, the state transportation department, and the department of natural resources if the action concerns any county road or portion of a county road that borders on, crosses, is adjacent to, or ends at a lake or the general course of a stream and the proposed action would result in the loss of public access. If the owner does not reside upon the land or the owner of record or occupant cannot be found within the county in which the land is situated, the notice to the owner of record or occupant of the land shall be served by posting in 3 public places in the township in which the road is situated, and by publication in a newspaper circulated within the county, 30 days before the time of hearing. Notice shall be served upon railroad companies by leaving a copy with the agent in charge of any ticket or freight office of the company operating the railroad, on the railroad line. The department of natural resources and the township or municipality within which the road is situated shall review the petition and determine within 30 days whether the property should be retained as an ingress and egress point. If the road is situated in a township, the township shall have first priority and the department of natural resources shall have second priority to retain the property as an ingress and egress point. If the road is not situated in a township, the department of natural resources shall have first priority to retain the property as an ingress and egress point.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Upon the service of the notice required in subsection (5), and before any further proceedings are held, the person by whom the service was made shall make and annex to the notice, or a copy of the notice, an affidavit stating the time and manner of service, which shall be by first-class mail, and by posting and advertising. In addition, if service is upon a railroad company, the affidavit shall so state and shall specify the agent upon whom service was made. The notice and affidavit, together with an affidavit of publication if the notice was published, shall be attached to the petition, and the whole shall be present at the time of the hearing upon the petition. The board of county road commissioners may designate, as hearing examiner, an employee to hold the hearing upon the petition. After the hearing, the examiner shall report all findings of fact to the board.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The board of county road commissioners or the superintendent or engineer employed by the board shall proceed to view the premises described in the petition and notice, and the board shall ascertain the necessity or advisability of absolutely abandoning and discontinuing the highway pursuant to the petition.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Subject to subsection (5), if the board of county road commissioners determines pursuant to this section to relinquish control, discontinue, abandon, or vacate any county road or portion of a county road that borders on, crosses, is adjacent to, or ends at a lake or the general course of a stream and the township, if applicable, or the department of natural resources decides to maintain the road as a public access site, it shall convey by quitclaim deed or relinquish jurisdiction over the property if the interest is nontransferable to the township or the state. If the township obtains the property or jurisdiction over the property as an ingress and egress point and later proposes to transfer the property or jurisdiction over the property, it shall give the department of natural resources first priority to obtain the property or jurisdiction over the property. If the state obtains the property or jurisdiction over the property under this subsection, the property shall be under the jurisdiction of the department of natural resources. The state may retain title to the property, transfer title to a local unit of government, or deed the property to the adjacent property owners. If the state has purchased the property with restricted fund revenue, money obtained from sale of the property shall be returned to that restricted fund. The local unit of government shall either maintain the property as a site of public access or allow it to revert to the adjoining landowners.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   Subject to subsection (5), if the board of county road commissioners determines pursuant to this section to abandon any county road or portion of a county road to a township, it shall quitclaim deed the property if the interest is nontransferable to the township. The township shall either retain the property or allow it to revert to the adjoining landowners.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   Within 30 days after final determination upon the petition for absolutely abandoning and discontinuing a highway, the board of county road commissioners shall file with the state transportation commission a full record and return of its proceedings. A determination by the board of county road commissioners under this section is binding for purposes of 1927 PA 341, MCL 247.41 to 247.46.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   The board of county road commissioners may reserve an easement for public utility purposes within the right-of-way of any road absolutely abandoned and discontinued under this section and may, by resolution, extinguish any easement so reserved whenever the easement ceases to be used for public utility purposes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   If interest in the property is conveyed or control over the property is relinquished to a local unit or this state under subsection (8), the local unit or this state, as applicable, shall operate and maintain the property so as to prevent and eliminate garbage and litter accumulation, unsanitary conditions, undue noise, and congestion as necessary.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   If a person shows substantial noncompliance with the requirements of subsection (12), the circuit court may order the local unit or this state to close the road ending in a manner to prevent ingress and egress to the body of water for a period of up to 30 days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(14)   If a person shows substantial noncompliance with the requirements of subsection (12) and the circuit court has previously closed the road ending for up to 30 days under subsection (13), the circuit court may order the local unit or this state to close the road ending in a manner to prevent ingress and egress to the body of water for 90 days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(15)   If a person shows substantial noncompliance with the requirements of subsection (12) and the circuit court has previously closed the road ending for 90 days under subsection (14), the circuit court may order the local unit or this state to close the road ending in a manner to prevent ingress and egress to the body of water for 180 days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(16)   If a person shows substantial noncompliance with the requirements of subsection (12) and the circuit court has previously closed the road ending for 180 days under subsection (15), the circuit court shall order the local unit or this state to show cause why the road ending should not be permanently closed in a manner to prevent ingress and egress to the body of water. Subject to subsection (17), the circuit court shall permanently close the road ending unless the local unit or this state shows cause why the road ending should not be closed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(17)   After a road ending is closed under subsection (16), and unless the property has been conveyed or relinquished to the adjacent landowners under subsection (18), the local unit or this state may petition the circuit court to reopen the road ending. The circuit court may order the road ending reopened if the local unit or this state presents a management plan to and posts a performance bond with the circuit court, and the circuit court finds that the management plan and performance bond are adequate to ensure compliance with subsection (12).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(18)   After a road ending is closed by the circuit court under subsection (16), 1 or more of the adjacent landowners may petition the circuit court to order the local unit or this state to convey any interest in the property that the local unit or this state holds to the adjacent landowners, or, if the interest is nontransferable, to relinquish control over the property to the adjacent landowners.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(19)   Proceedings under subsection (13), (14), (15), or (16) shall be initiated by application of 7 owners of record title of land in the local unit who own land within 1 mile of the road ending to the circuit court for the county in which the road ending is located. The applicants in the proceedings under subsection (13), (14), (15), (16), (17), or (18) shall give the persons described in subsection (5) notice of the application by registered mail.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 19.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The board of county road commissioners may grade, drain, construct, gravel, shale, or macadamize a road under its control, make an improvement in the road, and may extend and enlarge an improvement. The board may construct bridges and culverts on the line of the road, and repair and maintain roads, bridges, and culverts.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The commissioners shall take over, construct, and maintain the bridges included in the proposed system of county roads provided in section 18 of this chapter, except bridges that are lawfully taken over for construction and maintenance in whole or in part by the state. When it is necessary to construct a bridge across a navigable stream over which a road under the control of the board of county road commissioners runs, the board may construct, repair, and maintain a bridge across the navigable stream with proper and adequate approaches to the bridge for the accommodation of traffic, and the bridge and the approaches to the bridge shall be of a width, size, strength, material, pattern, and design which the board considers suitable to meet the necessities and requirements of traffic and the relevant conditions, despite the fact that the bridge or the approaches to the bridge, or a portion of either, is within the limits of an incorporated municipality. The board of county road commissioners may borrow money, enter into contracts, and pledge the credit of the county in the manner and within the limitations provided by law for this purpose. For money borrowed, an obligation assumed, or a pledge of credit given, the bonds of the county may be issued and sold when authorized by the electors in the manner provided by law. The authority and powers granted in this section relative to bridges over navigable streams and the grant of that authority are retroactive and all acts of boards of county road commissioners, county boards of commissioners and other county officers, and all elections held, indebtedness incurred or authorized, and bonds approved or authorized by the electors of the county, to be issued and sold for the purpose and with the intent to provide for the construction, repair, and maintenance of bridges over navigable streams and their approaches are valid and binding acts and obligations. The obligations assumed, indebtedness incurred, pledge of credit given, and bonds issued or authorized by counties within this state for these purposes are valid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The construction, improvement, and maintenance of roads, bridges, and culverts, shall be in accordance with plans and specifications furnished or approved by the county highway engineer, who shall have supervision of the construction. The county road commissioners have all the authority in respect to the roads, bridges, and culverts which is vested in highway officers in townships, including the right to condemn gravel for road purposes and to petition the county drain commissioner for an outlet drain as provided in section 8 of chapter 15.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The board of county road commissioners may maintain in its own name an action for injury to a county road, a part of the road as laid out and established, or to an improvement on the road. Money recovered in the action shall be paid to the county treasurer and shall be credited to the county road fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   When the board of county road commissioners decides to build or rebuild a road or bridge by a method other than by employment of day labor and purchase of necessary materials, the board shall advertise for sealed bids for the work, if the work involves an expenditure of an amount greater than $20,000.00. The board may reject any and all bids and may do the work by day labor, purchasing the necessary materials and employing the necessary labor. If the board decides to do the work by day labor, the plans and specifications together with all bids received on the plans and specifications, and the reason, in writing, for not letting the job by contract, shall be filed in the office of the county clerk. If a bridge is to be repaired or built at a cost greater than $500.00, the county road commissioners may apply to the state transportation department, which shall assign a competent engineer to review and report on plans that may have been prepared by the county highway engineer, or decide regarding the merits of each plan on which tenders may have been received before the contract was let, and pass on the completed structure before the contractor for that contract is paid.</DIV>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>224.19b Working within right-of-way of county road; permit required; exceptions; permit requirements and schedule of fees; schedule of civil fines; itemization of costs; annual and emergency permits; security; certain conditions prohibited; limitation on permit fee; performance of routine maintenance or repair work; silvicultural operations; security bond or right-of-way bond; general liability insurance; right-of-way access; voluntary agreement; violation; civil fine; definitions.</B><P>Sec. 19b.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A person, partnership, association, corporation, or governmental entity shall not construct, operate, maintain, or remove a facility or perform any other work within the right-of-way of a county road, except sidewalk installation and repair, without first obtaining a permit from the county road commission having jurisdiction over the road and from the township, city, or village in which the county road is located when a permit is required by ordinance of the township, city, or village, under the authority conferred by section 29 of article VII of the state constitution of 1963. The adjacent property owner is not required to obtain a permit for work incidental to the maintenance of the right-of-way lying outside of the shoulder and roadway.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A county road commission and a local unit of government may adopt, after a public hearing of which notice has been given by publication at least twice in a newspaper circulated in the county not more than 30 days nor less than 7 days before the hearing, reasonable permit requirements and, subject to subsections (6) and (7), a schedule of fees to be charged sufficient to cover only the necessary and actual costs applied in a reasonable manner for issuing the permit and for review of the proposed activity, inspection, and related expenses. In addition, a county road commission and a local unit of government may adopt a schedule of civil fines that can be imposed on a provider that performs work in a right-of-way without obtaining a permit as required under this section or that fails to maintain a security bond, right-of-way bond, or irrevocable letter of credit as required under this section during construction work within the right-of-way. The amount of a civil fine imposed on a provider must not exceed $5,000.00 per violation, and a civil fine must not be imposed on a provider if the work is required in a right-of-way on an emergency basis to restore services impacting public safety. After the work authorized in the permit has been completed, itemization of all costs must be supplied upon request of the permit holder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) When a road commission adopts procedures for issuing permits or adopts a schedule of fees as provided in this section, separate procedures and fee schedules must be adopted for issuing annual and emergency permits that reflect the minimal administrative burden of issuing an annual permit for frequent but routine and unobtrusive work such as surveying and the extraordinary emergency repairs to municipal or public utilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A county road commission may not refuse a permit requested by a government entity for the installation of a facility or utility owned by that government entity if security is given by the permittee or its contractor to the county road commission sufficient to insure restoration of the road and appurtenances to the road and the adjacent right-of-way to a condition reasonably equal to or better than that existing before that installation. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A county road commission shall not require a provider to perform or, except as otherwise provided in this section, pay for any topographic, boundary, environmental, or other kind of survey, study, or analysis of a right-of-way as a condition of or in connection with issuing a permit. A county road commission may require a provider to submit detailed engineering plans directly related to work in the right-of-way by that provider as a condition of or in connection with issuing a permit. In addition to any permit fees, a county road commission may require a provider to pay for any necessary and actual costs for inspections related to work in a right-of-way by that provider.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A county road commission shall not charge a government entity or, except as otherwise provided in this section, a provider a permit fee exceeding $300.00 per permit or, except as otherwise provided in this section, $1,000.00 total for all permit fees per project. In a county with a population of more than 250,000, a county road commission shall not charge a provider a permit fee exceeding $600.00 per permit or, except as otherwise provided in this section, $2,000.00 total for all permit fees per project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a county road commission shall not require a provider to obtain a permit for performing routine maintenance or repair work, as defined in the permit, in a right-of-way more than once a year, and shall not charge a provider an annual permit fee exceeding $300.00 for that permit for performing routine maintenance or repair work in a right-of-way. In a county with a population of more than 250,000, a county road commission shall not require a provider to obtain a permit for performing routine maintenance or repair work, as defined in the permit, in a right-of-way more than once a year, and shall not charge a provider an annual permit fee exceeding $600.00 for that permit for performing routine maintenance or repair work in a right-of-way. The annual permit fee provided in this subsection is not included in the permit fee limitation provided in subsection (6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) This section does not authorize a county road commission to require a permit for a driveway or routine maintenance in silvicultural operations that are otherwise permissible under the laws of this state. A county road commission shall not be held liable for the failure of a person performing work for which a permit is not required on a county road right-of-way to post a sign that gives advance warning of the work being performed in the right-of-way. As used in this subsection, "silvicultural operations" means silvicultural practices as that term is defined in section 51101 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.51101.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a county road commission shall not require a provider to have more than 1 security bond or right-of-way bond to secure the performance of the conditions of all permits issued that authorize the provider to construct, operate, maintain, or remove a facility or perform any other work anywhere within the right-of-way, as designated in the permits, of any road under the jurisdiction of the county road commission. The provider shall determine whether the security bond or right-of-way bond described in this subsection is an insurance bond or a cash bond. A county road commission shall not require the security bond or right-of-way bond to be a cash bond. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of a security bond or right-of-way bond described in this subsection must not exceed $20,000.00. In a county with a population of more than 250,000, the amount of a security bond or right-of-way bond described in this subsection must not exceed $40,000.00. Upon the request of a provider, the county road commission shall return a security bond or right-of-way bond to the provider within 120 days after the provider completes construction work in the right-of-way. Instead of providing a security bond or right-of-way bond, a provider may provide security that consists of an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a state or federally regulated financial institution licensed to do business in this state to secure the performance of the conditions of all permits issued that authorize the provider to construct, operate, maintain, or remove a facility or perform any other work anywhere within the right-of-way, as designated in the permits, of any road under the jurisdiction of the county road commission. Notwithstanding the limitation in this subsection requiring only 1 security bond or right-of-way bond, if there is a claim made against the bond, the provider must provide the county road commission with another security bond or right-of-way bond in order to continue working in that county. A bond required under this subsection must be from a state or federally regulated entity licensed to do business in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A provider shall maintain general liability insurance with minimum policy limits of $2,000,000.00 per occurrence for property damage and $2,000,000.00 per occurrence for bodily injury that apply to all claims, demands, suits, or causes of action arising in connection with or as a direct result of the provider's use and occupancy of a right-of-way under the jurisdiction of a county road commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) This section does not prohibit a county road commission and a provider from entering into a voluntary agreement regarding right-of-way access that includes permits, terms, and conditions that are different than the requirements or limitations imposed by this section, including, but not limited to, the amount of permit fees, terms of insurance, the size or number of security bonds or right-of-way bonds, or other valuable consideration. A county road commission that enters a voluntary agreement to access the rights-of-way with 1 provider shall offer similar terms and conditions regarding access to the rights-of-way to other providers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Except if work is required in a right-of-way on an emergency basis to restore services impacting public safety, a provider that performs work in a right-of-way without obtaining a permit as required under this section or that fails to maintain a security bond, right-of-way bond, or irrevocable letter of credit as required under this section during construction work within the right-of-way is responsible for a civil fine of not more than $5,000.00 per violation as provided in the schedule of civil fines adopted under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "County road commission" means the board of county road commissioners elected or appointed pursuant to section 6 of this chapter, or, in the case of a charter county with a population of 750,000 or more with an elected county executive that does not have a board of county road commissioners, the county executive for ministerial functions and the county commission provided for in section 14(1)(d) of 1966 PA 293, MCL 45.514, for legislative functions.

<P>Sec. 20.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Before the first day of October of each year said board of county road commissioners shall cause preliminary surveys, general plans, specifications and estimates of roads, bridges and culverts to be made by the county highway engineer, whose qualifications shall be approved by the state highway commissioner in case it is intended by the commissioners to apply for said reward. Based upon the above estimates, said board of county road commissioners shall determine upon the amount of tax which in its judgment should be raised for such year in said county for the purposes aforesaid, specifying and itemizing the roads and parts of roads upon which such moneys are to be expended, stating the amount asked for each of such roads, and shall cause such determination to be entered upon its records. Such tax shall not exceed five dollars on each one thousand dollars of assessed valuation according to the assessment roll of the last preceding year in counties where such valuation does not exceed twenty millions of dollars; such tax shall not exceed four dollars on each one thousand dollars of assessed valuation according to the assessment roll of the last preceding year in counties where such valuation is more than twenty million dollars and does not exceed forty millions of dollars; such tax shall not exceed three dollars on each one thousand dollars of assessed valuation according to the assessment roll of the last preceding year in counties where such valuation is more than forty million dollars and does not exceed one hundred million dollars; such tax shall not exceed two dollars on each one thousand dollars of assessed valuation according to the assessment roll of the last preceding year in counties where such valuation is more than one hundred million dollars and does not exceed three hundred million dollars; and such tax shall not exceed one dollar on each one thousand dollars of assessed valuation according to the assessment roll of the last preceding year in counties where such valuation is more than three hundred million dollars. At the annual meeting of the board of supervisors held in October, the county clerk shall lay such determination before the board of supervisors, and such board of supervisors shall pass upon the said determination, and if a majority of such board of supervisors agree therewith, then such tax shall be apportioned among the several townships and cities of said county according to their equalized valuation. If the determination of the board of county road commissioners shall not meet with the approval of a majority of the board of supervisors, then the said board of supervisors shall proceed to decide upon the amount of tax to be raised for such year in such county for the purposes aforesaid, and may allow or reject in whole or in part any or all of the items for the sections of roads thus submitted for its consideration; and it shall not be lawful for such county road commissioners without the consent of such board of supervisors to spend any such moneys upon any other roads than as thus specified. It shall be the duty of the board of supervisors to raise a sufficient tax to keep any county roads or bridges already built in reasonable repair, and in condition reasonably safe and fit for public travel. After the said board of supervisors shall have decided upon the amount of tax to be raised, the said board shall thereupon apportion such tax between the several townships and cities of said county according to their equalized valuation. The supervisors or other assessing officers in such townships and cities shall levy and apportion the taxes so apportioned as provided in this section, to their respective townships and cities respectively, upon which the county taxes are assessed. The taxes so assessed shall be collected and paid to the county treasurer the same as other county taxes. All the provisions of law relating to the assessment, levy, collection and return of county taxes and the sale of property delinquent therefor, shall apply to taxes to be raised pursuant to this act. The county treasurer shall keep a separate account of the taxes collected and moneys received under this act and shall pay the same out only upon the order of such board of county road commissioners and upon warrants signed by the chairman and countersigned by the clerk of the board. In counties having a county auditor or board of county auditors the warrants shall pass through the hands of such county auditors and be further countersigned by them, when payment shall be made thereof by the county treasurer. All moneys raised under the provisions of this act shall be expended by such board of county road commissioners exclusively for the purposes herein mentioned.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Any party in interest may appeal from the determination of the jury or commissioners in any proceedings under this chapter to the circuit court for the county, within 30 days, by filing with the township clerk an affidavit made by himself, his agent or attorney, stating that the determination is not in accordance with the just rights of the party, as the person making the affidavit verily believes. The party shall file with the clerk within the time a bond running to the township supervisor for the benefit of all other parties in interest, conditioned that the appellant will prosecute his appeal with all due diligence, and that if a judgment is rendered against him in the circuit court he will pay the judgment, including all costs with interest thereon. The bond shall be in a penalty sufficient to secure the costs and damages and with 1 or more sufficient sureties, who shall justify their responsibility in writing and under oath indorsed on the bond. The appellant shall pay to the township clerk the sum of $1.00 for making his return on appeal, and a sum of $3.00 as clerk and entry fee to be paid by the township clerk to the clerk of the circuit court. The appeal shall be heard before the judge of the circuit court, and a jury of 6 freeholders selected by the parties from the regular panel under the direction of the circuit judge, in the manner jurors are selected in civil causes, or if the parties desire, by 3 commissioners to be appointed by the circuit judge. The county clerk shall act as clerk of the court the same as in other causes, and the proceedings as far as applicable shall be according to the ordinary course of civil procedure. The judgment and determination on appeal shall be certified back to the township clerk for any further proceedings that may be required by the statute. In case of more than 1 appeal they shall be heard together as 1 cause. Costs may be awarded by the circuit court and collected the same as on appeals from district court. On perfecting the appeal all proceedings shall be stayed and no further steps taken until the determination or dismissal of the appeal. Costs shall not be awarded against any party, except those who actually appeal or defend the appeal.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 5.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whenever it is necessary or more convenient for the proper drainage of any highway in this state that the surplus water be taken onto or across the land adjacent thereto, the highway commissioner of the township in which said highway is situated, may secure the right of way and may open such drain or outlet for the water, and for these purposes may use any highway moneys of the township not otherwise appropriated, and such sums as may be voted for that use by the electors of the township. The highway commissioner shall secure the right of way for any such drain by gift or purchase from the owners of the land to be crossed by such drain; but in case of purchase the purchase price must be approved by the township board before any money be paid thereon. Such right of way shall be acquired by deed duly executed by the owner or owners of the lands sought to be crossed by the said drain, and shall be taken in the name of the township wherein the same is located, and filed in the office of the register of deeds of the county before any highway money shall be expended in opening such drain outside the highway limits.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The highway commissioner shall report to the electors of the township at their annual meeting the amount of money expended by him during the year for such highway drainage, specifying the amount expended on each drain. He shall also recommend the raising of such sums as he may deem necessary for opening drains from the highway during the coming year, specifying each proposed drain and the probable amount needed for securing the right of way and opening the same. The money voted for this purpose by the electors of the township shall constitute a special highway drain fund, and shall be used for no other purpose. In case any money be left in the fund, after opening the drain for which it was raised, it may be used in opening any other highway drain in the township, or in cleaning out, when necessary, those already opened.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 8.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In case the highway commissioner cannot secure the right of way across adjacent lands for the construction of any drain by agreement with the owner or owners of the land through which it will pass, he may make under his name of office an application to the drain commissioner of the county in which the proposed drain is situated, to lay out and establish the said drain. Such application shall conform to the law regulating applications for the construction of drains, and shall require no other signature than his own as highway commissioner. Such application shall have the same force and effect and be subject in other respects to the same laws and regulations that govern other applications for the establishment of drains, and shall confer jurisdiction and authority on the county drain commissioner to lay out and establish such drain under and by virtue and in pursuance of the law governing the location and establishment of other drains. It shall not be necessary to submit to the township board or boards of the township or townships crossed or affected by such drain the question of the necessity thereof or whether the same shall be conducive to health, convenience and welfare.</DIV>
