</P>
<P>Sec. 2.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The commissioners shall have the following qualifications: One shall be an attorney having knowledge of and experience in law relating to common carriers; the others shall have knowledge of traffic and transportation matters. Each of the commissioners shall devote to the duties of his office all the time necessary to insure the prompt and complete performance of all official duties, and the commission shall, so far as possible, arrange so that at all times during business hours, at least 1 member shall be in attendance at the principal office of the commission every business day in the year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The governor may at any time remove a commissioner for any neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. Before such removal, he shall give the commissioner a copy of the charges against him, and shall fix a time when he can be heard in his own defense, which shall not be less than 10 days thereafter, and the hearing shall be open to the public. If he shall be removed, the governor shall file in the office of the secretary of state a complete statement of the charges made against the commissioner and his finding thereon, with a record of the proceedings, it being herein provided and declared that such discretionary power in the governor to make such removal is a sound and reasonable discretion to be exercised for the good of the state, and not arbitrarily.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A person so appointed shall not be pecuniarily interested in a railroad or in the business of transporting persons or property in this state or elsewhere, and if a commissioner shall voluntarily become so interested, his office shall ipso facto, become vacant. If a commissioner becomes so interested otherwise than voluntarily, he shall, within a reasonable time, divest himself of such interests; failing so to do, his office shall become vacant, and the governor shall proceed as provided for in subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Before entering upon the duties of his office, each of the commissioners shall take and subscribe the constitutional oath of office.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The compensation of commissioners and the schedule for reimbursement of expenses shall be established annually by the legislature.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The commissioners appointed under this act shall forthwith, after their appointment and qualification, meet at the city of Lansing and organize by electing 1 of their members chairman. On January 15 in each odd numbered year the commissioners shall meet at the offices of the commission and elect a chairman, who shall serve for 2 years and until his successor is elected. A majority of the commissioners shall constitute a quorum to transact business, and a vacancy shall not impair the right of the remaining commissioners to exercise all of the powers of the commission so long as the majority remains. Any investigation, inquiry, or hearing which the commission has power to undertake or to hold may be undertaken or held by or before any commissioner when so directed by the commission or its chairman. All such investigations, inquiries or hearings of a commissioner shall be and be deemed to be the investigations, inquiries, and hearings of the commission, and every decision and order made by a commissioner, when approved and confirmed by the commission and ordered filed in its office, shall be and be deemed to be the decision and order of the commission. An interested party shall be entitled to a rehearing before the full commission on request served upon the commission within 5 days after service of the order upon the party. In the absence of a quorum of the commission at the time appointed for a hearing before the commission, the hearing may be continued to a later date by a single member of the commission present or, in the absence of a member, by the secretary.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The commission may appoint a secretary at a salary to be established annually by the legislature and a chief clerk at a salary to be established annually by the legislature, and employ not more than 5 clerks, and such inspectors, examiners and experts as may be necessary to perform what may be required of them, and shall fix their compensation. It shall be the duty of any such inspector, on the order of the commission, and he shall have the right to inspect all equipment, cars, power houses, trolley lines, tracks, and property of every common carrier as defined in this act. Each such inspector shall likewise have the right to inspect freight in cars or warehouses of those common carriers, and all waybills, bills of lading, and shipping receipts of such transportation companies, so that they may determine whether the classification and rating of the freight is in conformity with the published tariffs and classifications of the transportation companies. The inspectors shall be employed at a fixed compensation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The secretary shall take and subscribe to an oath similar to that of the commissioners, and shall keep full and correct records of all transactions and proceedings of the commission, and shall perform such other duties as may be required by the commission. Any person ineligible to the office of a commissioner shall be ineligible to the office of secretary. The secretary shall devote his entire time to the office.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   The commission may appoint a chief inspecting engineer at a salary to be established annually by the legislature, to be fixed by the commission, whose duty it shall be under the instructions of the commission, to make such inspections and reports as may be ordered by the commission as regards the public safety, health, and convenience, and which the commission may deem essential to full and thorough information as to physical condition of the properties of the various common carriers of the state and the proper enforcement of the police regulations enacted for the control and management of the same. The engineer shall have such general knowledge of the requirements of railroad operation, signal appliances, and safety devices as shall fit him to perform the duties imposed upon him by the provisions of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   The commission shall be known collectively as "Michigan railroad commission," and in that name may sue and be sued. It shall have a seal with the words "Michigan railroad commission," and such other design as the commission may prescribe engraved thereon, by which it shall authenticate its proceedings and of which the court may take judicial notice.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   The commission shall have its offices at Lansing, and shall be provided suitable offices, necessary office furniture, supplies, stationery, books, periodicals, maps, printing, and all its necessary expenses shall be audited and paid as other necessary state expenses are audited and paid. The commission may hold meetings at other places than its offices when the convenience of the parties so requires. The commissioners, secretary, clerks, and inspectors and such experts as may be employed, shall be entitled to receive from the state their actual and necessary expenses while traveling on the business of the commission, such expenditures to be sworn to by the person who incurred the expense and to be approved by the chairman of the commission. Members of the commission, when traveling on official business of the commission pertaining to railroads, and employees of the commission when traveling on official business of the commission pertaining to railroads and by the direction of the commission, shall be carried free in performance of their duties, on all railroads within this state, upon all trains and cars, and upon any parts of those trains or cars. Any such person who shall suffer himself to be carried free on any train or car by any such railroad company, when not traveling on official business of the commission and not by direction of the commission, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction shall be punished by a fine of not less than $100.00 nor more than $500.00 or by imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   The commission shall have the power to adopt and publish rules to govern its proceedings and to regulate the mode and manner of all investigations and hearings of common carriers and other parties before it, and all hearings shall be open to the public.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   The commission may confer by correspondence, by attending conventions, or otherwise, with the railroad commissioners of other states, with the interstate commerce commission, or with any other bodies considering any matters pertaining to common carriers.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 6.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Any railroad, subject to the provisions of this act, upon application of any shipper tendering traffic for transportation, shall construct, maintain and operate upon reasonable terms a switch connection with any private side track, when such connection is reasonably practicable and can be put in with safety and will furnish sufficient business to justify the construction and maintenance of same, and shall furnish cars and transport to the best of its ability any traffic tendered to, over or from such private side track, without discrimination in favor of or against any such shipper: Provided, This shall not be construed to compel a railroad to remove from or deliver on a private side track traffic tendered in less than car lots: Provided further, That shipments of live stock, perishable property and explosives shall have precedence over all other classes of merchandise. If any railroad shall fail to install and operate any such switch or connection as aforesaid, on application therefor in writing by any shipper, any shipper may make complaint to the commission, as provided by section 22 of this act, and the commission shall make investigation of the same, and it shall determine as to the safety, practicability and justification thereof, and shall fix a reasonable compensation therefor, and the commission shall make an order as provided in section 22 of this act, directing the railroads to comply with the provisions of this section in accordance with such order, and such order shall be enforced as hereinafter provided for the enforcement of all other orders by the commission, other than orders for the payment of money. The commission shall have power, and is hereby authorized, to fix and establish reasonable switching rules and regulations, and establish reasonable limits for said switching and reasonable rates therefor, including rules and regulations regarding absorption of switching rates;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Every railroad shall provide a reasonable, adequate and suitable spur track to and to and upon the grounds of any mill, elevator, storehouse, warehouse, dock, wharf, pier, manufacturing establishment, lumber yard, coal dock or other industry or enterprise, wherever such spur track does not necessarily exceed 2 miles in length and is practically indispensable to the successful operation of any such industry or enterprise, and shall connect such spur track with its main track and operate the same in connection therewith: Provided, That such railroad may require the person or persons, firm, corporation or association primarily to be served thereby, to pay the legitimate cost and expense of acquiring by condemnation or purchase where necessary the rights of way for such spur track, and of constructing the same, in which case the total estimated cost thereof shall be deposited with the railroad before the railroad shall be required to incur any expense whatever therefor. No railroad shall, however, be required to provide a spur track where it is unusually unsafe and dangerous: Provided, That in the event of the failure of said shipper and the said railroad to agree, the necessity for, reasonableness of, and practical safety of such spur track and connection and the operation thereof shall be decided by the said public utilities commission upon complaint and hearing as provided in section 22 of this act.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 7.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   All railroads subject to the provisions of this act shall afford all reasonable and proper facilities by the establishment of switch connections between one another and the establishment of depots and otherwise for the interchange of traffic between their respective lines and for the receiving, forwarding and delivering of passengers and property to and from their several lines and those connecting therewith, and shall transfer and deliver without unreasonable delay or discrimination any freight or cars or passengers destined to any point on its own line or on any connecting line, and shall not discriminate in their rates and charges between such connecting lines: Provided, Precedence may be given to live stock and perishable property. Nothing in this act shall be construed as requiring any railroad to give the use of its tracks or terminal facilities to another railroad engaged in like business, except that carload traffic shall be received and transported from any junction point or transfer point or intersection with another railroad in any city or town, destined to team tracks or other sidings in the same city or town as hereinafter provided. Any person or any officer or agent of any corporation or company who shall deliver property for transportation to any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act shall have the right and privilege of routing such shipments and of prescribing and directing over what connecting line property so shipped shall be transported, and it shall be the duty of the initial carrier to observe the direction of such person or such officer or agent of any corporation or company, and to cause such freight to be transported over such connecting line as may be directed and required by such shipper. When freight is shipped in intrastate commerce and any person or officer or agent of any corporation or company who shall deliver property for transportation does not prescribe over what connecting line such property shall be transported, it shall be the duty of the initial carrier to so route the freight as to give the property the benefit of the lowest rate published between points of origin and destination;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Where it is practicable and the same may be accomplished without endangering the equipment, tracks or appliances of either party, the commission may, upon application, require steam railroads and interurban and suburban railroads to interchange cars, carload shipments, less than carload shipments and passenger traffic, and for that purpose may require the construction of physical connections upon such terms as it may determine and such suburban and interurban railroads may be used for handling of freight in carload lots in steam railroad freight cars between shippers or consignees and the steam railroads, in the same manner and under the same general conditions, except as to motive power, as belt line railroads and terminal railroads are now or may hereafter be used for like purposes;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Every corporation owning a railroad in use shall, at reasonable times and for a reasonable compensation, draw over the same the merchandise and cars of any other corporation or individual having connecting tracks: Provided, Such cars are of the proper gauge, are in good running order and equipped as required by law and otherwise safe for transportation and properly loaded: Provided further, If the corporations cannot agree upon the times at which the cars shall be drawn or the compensation to be paid, the said commission shall, upon petition of either party and notice to the other, after hearing the parties interested, determine the rate of compensation and fix such other periods, having reference to the convenience and interests of the corporation or corporations and the public to be accommodated thereby and the award of the commission shall be binding upon the respective corporations interested therein until the same shall have been revised;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Every common carrier operating within this state shall receive and transport at reasonable rates any and all carload traffic offered for transportation under the usual conditions locally consigned between points in the same city or town and shall receive and transport at reasonable rates from any junction point or transfer point or intersection with another railroad in such city or town any and all such carload freight destined to team tracks or other sidings on any line operated by the delivering carrier, and shall deliver such car or cars upon such team tracks or sidings in the city or town where such car or cars are received from such connecting line when required so to do: Provided, That when delivery is requested which will involve the use of a private siding not owned or controlled by consignee, said consignee shall file with both receiving and delivering carriers written permission signed by the owner or lessee of such private siding authorizing the use of same. When the particular delivery desired cannot be accomplished owing to the congestion of cars upon such siding or team tracks, it shall be the duty of the delivering carrier to notify consignee of such conditions and it shall be the duty of consignee upon receipt of such notice to advise upon what other siding delivery will be accepted or whether or not it is desired that such car or cars shall be held waiting the opportunity for delivery upon the siding originally designated as the destination;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   That any common carrier, railroad or transportation company receiving property for transportation from a point in the state of Michigan to another point within the state of Michigan, shall issue a receipt or bill of lading therefor, and shall be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss, damage or injury to such property caused by it or by any common carrier, railroad or transportation company to which said property may be delivered or over whose line or lines such property may pass, and no contract, receipt, rule or regulation, shall exempt such common carrier, railroad or transportation company from the liability hereby imposed: Provided, That nothing in this section shall deprive any holder of such receipt or bill of lading of any remedy or right of action which he has under existing law: Provided further, That the property so received for transportation shall move entirely within the boundaries of the state of Michigan between the points of shipment and its destination: And provided further, That the common carrier, railroad or transportation company issuing such receipt or bill of lading shall be entitled to recover from the common carrier, railroad or transportation company, on whose line or lines the loss, damage or injury shall have been sustained, the amount of such loss, damage or injury as it may be required to pay to the owners of such property as may be evidenced by any receipt, judgment or transcript thereof.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Every railroad shall, when within its power so to do, and upon reasonable notice, furnish suitable cars to any and all persons who may apply therefor, for the transportation of any and all kinds of freight in carload lots. Every common carrier shall have sufficient cars and motive power to meet all requirements for the transportation of passengers and property which may reasonably be anticipated.

</P>
<P>Sec. 10.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Every common carrier subject to the provisions of this act shall file with the commission created by this act and print and keep open to public inspection in each of its depots and offices, schedules showing all rates, fares and charges for transportation, both of passengers and property, between different points on its own route, and between points on its own route and on the route of any other carrier, when a through route and joint rate have been established. If no joint rate over the through route has been established, the several carriers in such through route shall file, print and keep open to public inspection as aforesaid the separately established rates, fares and charges applied to the through transportation. The schedules printed as aforesaid by any common carrier, shall plainly state the places between which property and passengers will be carried and shall contain the classification of freight in force and shall also state separately all terminal charges, storage charges, icing charges and all other charges which the commission may require, all privileges or facilities granted or allowed and any rules or regulations which in any wise change, affect or determine any part of or the aggregate of such aforesaid rates, fares and charges, or the value of the service rendered to the passengers, shipper or consignee: Provided, That where local switching tariffs are in effect at a competitive point, it shall be sufficient if the schedule state that the terminal charges shall be subject to the rules of such local switching tariffs. Such schedules shall be printed plainly in large type, and copies for the use of the public shall be kept on file for public inspection in every depot, station or office of such carrier where passengers or freight respectively are received for transportation or where tickets are sold, in such form that they will be accessible to the public and can conveniently be inspected. The provisions of this section shall apply to all traffic and transportation and facilities defined in this act;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   No change shall be made in the schedule of rates, fares or charges or joint rates, fares or charges which have been filed and published by common carriers in compliance with the requirements of this section, except after 30 days' notice to the commission and to the public published as aforesaid, which shall plainly state the changes proposed to be made in the schedule of rates, fares or charges or joint rates, fares or charges then in force and the time when such changed rates, fares or charges or joint rates, fares or charges will go into effect, and no such rates, fares or charges or joint rates, fares or charges shall be discontinued, except after giving such notice as is required for changing rates, fares or charges or joint rates, fares or charges, and the proposed changes in such rates, fares or charges or joint rates, fares or charges shall be shown by printing and filing new tariffs thereto or by showing such changes or discontinuance by issuing and filing of supplements in the regular manner now provided and keeping same open to public inspection: Provided, That the commission may, in its discretion and for good cause shown, allow changes upon less time than the notice herein specified, or modify the requirements in this section in respect to publishing, posting and filing of tariffs, either in particular instances or by general order applicable to special or peculiar circumstances or conditions: Provided further, That upon the filing with the commission by a common carrier of any tariff or supplement showing any change in rates, fares or charges or joint rates, fares or charges or a discontinuance of any rate or rates, fares or charges or joint rates, fares or charges, it shall be lawful for the said commission and it is hereby authorized, acting upon its own initiative or upon complaint, to postpone the date when such new rate or rates or joint rates, fares or charges or discontinuance of rate or rates or joint rates, fares or charges, shall become effective to such time not to exceed in all 45 days as shall give the said commission opportunity to investigate the reasonableness of such proposed rate or rates or discontinuance of rate or rates, and it shall thereupon be lawful for said commission and it is hereby authorized to proceed with all convenient speed with an investigation upon at least 5 days' notice to said common carrier either upon its own initiative or upon complaint as to the reasonableness of said rate or rates or the discontinuance of said rate or rates, follow the procedure as near as may be, and make its order therein in the manner hereinafter provided in section 22 of this act, such investigation to take precedence of all matters of a different nature pending before the commission;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The names of the several carriers which are parties to any joint tariff shall be specified therein and each of the parties thereto, other than the one filing the same, shall file with the commission such evidence of concurrence therein or acceptance thereof as may be required or approved by the commission, and where evidence of concurrence or acceptance is filed it shall not be necessary for the carriers filing the same to also file copies of the tariffs in which they are named as parties;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The commission may determine and prescribe the form in which the schedules required by this section to be kept open to the public inspection shall be prepared and arranged and may change the form from time to time as may be found expedient;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Such schedules shall, so far as is practicable, conform to the forms prescribed by the interstate commerce commission;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   No carrier, unless otherwise provided by this act, shall engage or participate in the transportation of passengers or property as defined in this act, unless the rates, fares and charges upon which the same are transported by said carrier have been filed and published in accordance with the provisions of this act, nor shall any carrier charge or demand or collect or receive a greater or less or different compensation for such transportation of passengers or property or for any service in connection therewith between the points named in such fares and charges which are specified in the tariff filed and in effect at the time; nor shall any carrier refund or remit in any manner or by any device any portion of the rates, fares and charges so specified, nor extend to any shipper or person any privilege or facilities in the transportation of persons or property, except such as are specified in such tariff;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Within 2 years after the delivery of any shipment of freight at destination, and not after, any person aggrieved may complain to the commission that the charge exacted for the transportation of such freight between points in Michigan is irregular or exorbitant, and thereupon the commission shall have power to investigate such complaint, and to hear the same and to decide upon the merits thereof, in the manner provided by section 22 of this act. If, upon such hearing, the commission shall decide that the rate or charge exacted is irregular or exorbitant it shall find what, in its judgment, would have been a reasonable rate or charge for the service complained of. If the rate or charge so found shall be less than the charge exacted and the commission shall determine that any party complainant is entitled to an award of damages under the provisions of this act for a violation thereof, the commission shall make an order authorizing and directing the carrier to pay the complainant the sum to which he is entitled on or before a day named. In case of the refusal of the carrier to make such refund, the party aggrieved thereby may maintain an action in the courts of this state to recover the amount of such excessive charge as found by said commission, and in the trial thereof the findings of the commission shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of the facts found by it, and no carrier shall be permitted to avail itself in the defense of such action that the shipment involved was in fact made on the published tariff rate in force at the time such shipment was made, but no carrier making a refund upon the order of the commission or pursuant to a judgment of court as herein provided, shall be liable for any penalty or forfeiture, or subject to any prosecution under the laws of this state on account of making such refund;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   In time of war or threatened war preference and precedence shall, upon the demand of the governor of the state, be given over all other traffic to the transportation of troops and material of war, and carriers shall adopt every means within their control to facilitate and expedite the military traffic;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Every common carrier within this state shall within 90 days, unless further time be granted by the commission, file in the office of the commission copies of all schedules of rates, including joint rates in force on its line or lines between points within this state on the date this act takes effect, not previously filed by such carrier with the Michigan railroad commission.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Every railroad, unless excused therefrom by the order of the commission made after petition and hearing, shall provide and maintain adequate depots and depot buildings, including facilities for checking baggage and the sale of tickets at its regular stations and at such other points as the commission shall direct, for the accommodation of passengers, which buildings shall be kept clean, well-lighted and warm for the accommodation of the traveling public. All railroads shall keep and maintain adequate and suitable freight depots, buildings, switches and sidetracks for the receiving, handling and delivering of freight transported or to be transported by such railroads. Upon the filing of complaint with the commission and hearing thereon as provided in section 22, the commission is authorized to make full inquiry in the matter of station facilities, train service, name of station, etc., at the station in question, and make such orders in regard to the building of depots, interurban railway shelters, name of station, stopping of trains or cars, necessary sidings and other track accommodations as it shall deem for the public interest and shall be just and reasonable. No order shall be made by the commission with reference to the name of a station until the change so ordered shall have been asked for by a majority vote of the citizens of the township, incorporated village or city in which such station is located.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Where 2 or more railroads connect they shall, if so ordered by the commission after hearing, provide at the junction point a joint depot and suitable accommodations for passengers and merchandise. If the railroads cannot agree in providing such accommodations and for the maintenance thereof, the commission may determine the character of the accommodations to be provided and apportion the cost thereof and the expense of the maintenance of the same between the several roads.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Passenger service shall not be discontinued in this state without the permission of the commission and unless the railroad desiring to discontinue such service shall first file a petition with the commission, and hearing is held thereon as provided in section 22. The commission at such hearing shall inquire into the convenience and necessity of the service to the public and shall render its decision thereon. At any hearing upon such petition any person, association, corporation, municipality or governmental unit whose interests shall be adversely affected by the discontinuance of the service, may petition the commission for leave to intervene in said proceedings and participate therein as a party. If it shall appear to the commission from the state of the applicant's interests that the interests may be adversely affected by the discontinuance of service, the commission shall grant permission to intervene. The provisions of this act shall not apply to temporary or seasonal trains.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Any common carrier, or other party in interest, being dissatisfied with any order of the commission made under the provisions of this section, shall have the same rights to appeal and review as provided under section 26, as amended.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 22.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Upon complaint in writing of any person, firm or corporation or association, or of any mercantile, agricultural or manufacturing society, or of any body politic or municipal organization, that any of the rates, fares, charges or classifications, or any joint rate or rates are in any respect unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory, or that any regulation or practice whatsoever affecting the transportation of persons or property or any service in connection therewith, is in any respect unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory, or that any service is inadequate, the commission shall notify the common carrier complained of that complaint has been made and shall furnish a copy of the said complaint with said notice, and 20 days after such notice has been given the commission may proceed to investigate the same as hereinafter provided. Before proceeding to make the investigation, the commission shall give the said common carrier and the complainants at least 10 days' notice of the time and place when and where such matters will be considered and determined, and said parties shall be entitled to be heard and shall have process to enforce the attendance of witnesses. Such hearings may be continued from time to time in the discretion of the commission. If, upon such investigation, the rate or rates, joint rate or rates, fares, charges or classifications, regulation, practice or service complained of shall be found to be unreasonable, inadequate or unjustly discriminatory, the commission shall have power to and it shall determine and by order fix and order substituted therefor, such rate or rates, joint rate or rates, fares and charges, as is or are just and reasonable, and which shall be the maximum to be charged in the future, and such classifications, regulation, practice or service as is or are just, reasonable and adequate, and which shall be imposed and followed or service rendered in future in lieu of that found to be unreasonable, inadequate or unjustly discriminatory, and in either case the commission shall make an order that the common carrier cease and desist from such violation, and shall conform to the regulation and practice so prescribed, and it shall cause a certified copy of each such order to be delivered to an officer or station agent of the common carrier affected thereby, which order shall, of its own force, take effect and become operative 20 days after the service thereof. All common carriers to which the order applies shall, on or before the date when such order becomes effective, make such changes in schedules on file as shall be necessary to make the same conform to such order, and no change shall within 2 years thereafter be made by any such common carrier in any such rates, fares or charges, or in any such joint rate or rates, without the approval of the commission. Certified copies of all other orders of the commission shall be delivered to the common carriers thereby affected in like manner, and the same shall take effect within such times thereafter as the commission shall prescribe;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The commission may, when the complaint is made of more than 1 rate or charge, order separate hearings thereon, and may consider and determine the several matters complained of separately and at such times as it may prescribe. No complaint shall of necessity at any time be dismissed because of the absence of direct damage to the complainant;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Whenever the commission shall believe that any rate or rates or charge or charges may be unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory, or that any service is inadequate, and that any investigation relating thereto should be made, it may, upon its own motion, investigate the same. Before making such investigation, it shall present to the common carrier a statement in writing, setting forth the rate or charge to be investigated. Thereafter, on 10 days' notice to the common carrier of the time and place of such investigation, the commission may proceed to investigate such rate or charge in the same manner and make like orders in respect thereto as if such investigation had been made upon complaint;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   This section shall be construed to permit any common carrier to make complaint of like effect as though made by any person, firm, corporation or association, mercantile, agricultural or manufacturing society, body politic or municipal organization;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The commission may, after hearing on a complaint, establish through routes and joint rates as the maximum to be charged and the terms and conditions under which such through routes shall be operated when the common carriers complained of have refused or neglected to voluntarily establish such through routes and joint rates: Provided, No reasonably satisfactory through route and joint rate exist. Whenever the common carrier or common carriers, in obedience to an order of the commission or otherwise, in respect to joint rates, fares or charges, shall fail to agree among themselves upon the apportionment or division thereof, the commission may after hearing make a supplemental order prescribing the just and reasonable proportion of such joint rate, fare or charge to be received by each common carrier party thereto, which order shall take effect as part of the original order.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Each of the commissioners, for the purposes mentioned in this act, shall have power to administer oaths, certify to official acts, issue subpoenas, compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of papers, way bills, books, accounts, documents and testimony. In case of disobedience on the part of any person or persons, or willful failure to comply with any order of the commission or any commissioner or any subpoena, or upon the refusal of any witness to testify regarding any matter upon which he may be lawfully interrogated, or to produce any books or papers in his custody or control which he shall have been required by any commissioner to produce, it shall be the duty of the circuit court or any court, or a judge thereof, upon application of a commissioner, to compel obedience by attachment proceedings for contempt, as in the case of disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued from such court, or a refusal to testify therein, and in addition said commissioner shall have the powers vested in justices of the peace and notaries public to compel witnesses to testify and to produce books and papers;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Each witness who shall appear before the commission by its order shall receive for his attendance the fees and mileage now provided for witnesses in civil cases in circuit court, which shall be audited and paid by the state in the same manner as other expenses are audited and paid, upon the presentation of proper vouchers sworn to by such witnesses and approved by the chairman of the commission: Provided, That no witnesses subpoenaed at the instance of parties other than the commission shall be entitled to compensation from the state for attendance and travel, unless the commission shall certify that his testimony was material and necessary to the matter investigated;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The commission or any party may, in any investigation, cause the depositions of witnesses residing within or without the state to be taken in the manner prescribed by law for like depositions in civil actions in the circuit courts;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A full and complete record shall be kept of all proceedings had before the commission on any investigation had under section 22 of this act and all testimony shall be taken down by a stenographer appointed by the commission. When any complaint is served upon the commission under the provisions of section 26 of this act the commission shall, before said action is reached for trial, cause the certified transcript of all proceedings had and testimony taken upon such investigation to be filed with the clerk of the circuit court of the county where the action is pending. A transcribed copy of the evidence and proceedings, or any specific part thereof, or any investigation, taken by the stenographer, certified by him to be a true and correct transcript of all the testimony on the investigation or of a particular witness, or of any specific part thereof, carefully compared by him with his original notes, and to be a correct statement of the evidence and proceedings had on such investigation so purporting to be taken and transcribed shall be received in evidence with the same effect as if such stenographer were present and testified to the facts so certified. A copy of such transcript shall be furnished upon demand, free of cost, to any party to such investigations, and to all other persons on payment of a reasonable amount therefor.</DIV>

The court of appeals shall not have jurisdiction over any appeal that is filed later than the 30-day appeal period provided for in this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An appeal of any decision or order of the Michigan public service commission that is pending in the circuit court on the effective date of this subsection shall proceed and be decided in that court and appealed pursuant to the applicable law in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this subsection, if on that date, the appeal has progressed beyond the filing of a complaint and answer. All other pending cases shall be transferred promptly by the circuit court to the court of appeals.</DIV>

If the commission rescinds its order, the appeal shall be dismissed. If the commission alters, modifies, or amends its order, that amended order shall take the place of the original order, and the court of appeals shall render its decision based on the amended order. If the original order is not rescinded or amended by the commission, judgment shall be rendered upon the original order.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 34.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whenever the commission shall have reasonable grounds to believe, either on complaint or otherwise, that any of the equipment, cars, tracks, bridges or other structures of any common carrier of this state are in a condition which renders any of them dangerous or unfit for the transportation of passengers with reasonable safety, or unreasonably endangering the employes of such carrier, it shall be its duty to inspect and examine, or cause to be inspected, examined and tested by some competent person or persons, and for that purpose it, the said commission, may employ some other person possessing especial knowledge and skill in the construction of railroads and bridges, as an expert, and if, on such examination, in its opinion any such equipment, cars, tracks, bridges or other structures be dangerous or unfit for the transportation of passengers with reasonable safety, or unreasonably endanger the employes of such carrier, it shall be its duty to give the superintendent or other executive officer of the corporation, working or operating said defective, dangerous or unfit equipment, car, track or bridge or other structure, notice of the condition thereof, and of the repairs or changes necessary to place the same in a reasonably safe condition, and of the time within which such repairs or changes shall be made. It may also order and direct the rate of speed of passing trains or cars over such dangerous or defective track, bridge or other structure, until the said repairs shall be made. If any superintendent or other executive officer aforesaid, receiving such notice or order to direct the proper subordinate officers of said corporation to run the passenger trains or cars over such defective track, bridge or other structure, at the speed so prescribed by the commission, or if any engineer, conductor or other employe of such company shall knowingly disobey such order, every such superintendent, officer, conductor or employe shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished as provided in section 43 of this act. The said commission shall have power to wholly prohibit the running of passenger trains or cars over such defective, dangerous or unfit track, bridge or other structure, or the use of such dangerous, unfit or defective equipment or car, if said company shall neglect or without reasonable cause fail to make such repairs within the time prescribed by the commission; and such company, for each and every day that ensues thereafter, and until such changes or repairs are made, shall forfeit and pay to the state the sum of 100 dollars. In case of the employment of an expert, as provided for in this section, the commission shall issue a certificate, which shall set forth the amount of time said expert has been employed, and the pay he is to receive therefor, which certificate shall entitle the holder thereof to receive the amount mentioned therein in the same manner as other employes of the state are paid.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 35.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The state transportation department shall promulgate rules establishing the standards by which the director of the department shall determine maximum speed limits for railroad locomotives when used in passenger train operations and for passenger railroad trains. The rules shall provide that the director base his or her determinations on engineering, traffic, and safety inspections; on federal railroad safety standards; and on state on-site inspection criteria provided for in the rules.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The speed limits established by the director shall designate expressly those portions of the railroad routes in this state to which the speed limits shall apply for passenger train operations. The maximum speed limit for passenger train operations may vary on specified portions of a route on the basis of safety and other factors.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Before making a determination establishing a maximum speed limit, the director of the state transportation department shall give consideration to local governmental comments. After determining the maximum speed limit, the director of the state transportation department shall issue an order notifying each city, village, and township of the effective date of the speed limit, which date shall not be less than 30 days following the date of the order. The speed limit shall take effect on the specified date unless an appeal, by resolution of the local governing body or by the operating railroad, is filed with the state transportation commission before the proposed effective date of the speed limit as is set forth in the order. If a timely appeal is filed, the order shall not take effect within that city, village, or township unless the order is approved or modified by resolution of the state transportation commission following consideration of the appeal by the commission. If the commission approves or modifies an order by resolution, the effective date of the speed limit shall be established in the resolution of the commission, and the director shall issue a revised order with regard to that city, village, or township.</DIV>

The commission, having determined such form of protection, shall immediately cause a description thereof over its official signature to be delivered to an officer of the railroad affected thereby, with notice that the same must be adopted and put into practical force within a reasonable time to be fixed by the commission.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Any railroad or other party in interest, being dissatisfied with any order of the department may within 30 days after the issuance of the order commence an action in the circuit court for the county of Ingham, against the department as defendant to vacate and set aside the order. The department shall be served with a summons and a copy of the complaint. The department shall file its answer, and on leave of court any interested party may file an answer to the complaint. Upon the filing of the answer of the department the action shall be at issue and stand ready for hearing upon 10 days' notice by either party. An action brought under this section shall have precedence over any civil cause of a different nature pending in that court and shall proceed, be tried, and determined as other civil suits. Any party to the action may introduce original evidence in addition to the transcript of evidence offered to the department. The circuit court may affirm, vacate, or set aside the order of the department in whole or in part, and may make such other order or decree as the court determines to be in accordance with the facts and the law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An injunction shall not issue to suspend or stay an order of the department, except upon application to the circuit court, with notice and opportunity to be heard on the matter given to the department.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If, upon the trial of the action, evidence is introduced that is found by the court to be different from, or in addition to, that offered upon the hearing before the department, the court, before proceeding to render judgment, unless the parties in the action stipulate in writing to the contrary, shall transmit a copy of that evidence to the department, and shall stay further proceedings in the action for 15 days after the date of that transmission. Upon receipt and consideration of the evidence the department may alter, modify, amend, or rescind its order complained of in the action, and shall report its action thereon to the court within 10 days after receipt of the evidence. If the department rescinds the order complained of, the action shall be dismissed. If the department alters, modifies, or amends the order, the altered, modified, or amended order shall take the place of the original order complained of, and judgment shall be rendered thereon as though made by the department in the first instance. If the original order is not rescinded or changed by the department, judgment shall be rendered upon such original order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Within 60 days after service of a copy of the final judgment of the court, either party to the action may appeal to the court of appeals, which appeal shall be governed by the statutes governing civil appeals. When the appeal is taken the case shall, on the return of the papers to the court of appeals, be immediately placed on the calendar of the then pending term, and shall be brought to a hearing in the same manner as other cases on the calendar, or if no term is then pending, shall take precedence of cases of a different nature except criminal cases at the next term of the court of appeals.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   In all actions under this section the burden of proof shall be upon the complainant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the order of the department complained of is unreasonable or discriminatory.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 301.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The department, upon request of any interested party or by its own interest, may when it considers necessary assess the physical condition and safety needs of grade crossings of railroad tracks with public streets and highways or with a nonmotorized trail by scheduling a diagnostic study team review at the grade crossing or group of grade crossings. Written notice shall be given to all parties 15 days before the review. Each affected organization shall be represented by a knowledgeable individual prepared to contribute information requested in the notice and empowered to make decisions on behalf of that party. A decision by a diagnostic study team concerning the safety needs of a grade crossing based upon current roadway and railroad traffic levels, speeds and other parameters, funding arrangements, division of responsibility, and scheduling will be mutually decided to accommodate adjustments or improvements, relocations, closures, grade separations, or other changes reasonably required in the interest of public welfare and safety. The department shall issue an order confirming the agreements reached, in writing, to all parties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If consensus cannot be reached during the diagnostic study team review, the department, by order to the affected parties, shall require such adjustments or improvements, relocations, closures, or other changes as may be reasonably required in the interest of public welfare and safety. The railroad or railroads having responsibility for the track or tracks in the grade crossing, and the road authority having jurisdiction of the streets or highways shall be given due notice and have the right to a hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The cost of an adjustment or improvement, relocation, closure, grade separation, or other change determined necessary by a department order shall be funded as provided in this act. Items of work which would usually be at the expense of the railroad or road authority may be funded from the following sources if the work is eligible for such funding and if the funds are available:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   First, from federal funds obtained through the federal aid railroad-highway grade crossing improvement program.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Second, from state funds obtained through the railroad grade crossing account of the state trunk line fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The department shall administer these funds in an efficient and equitable manner by establishing an annual prioritization of grade crossing safety improvements. Items of work determined to be routine maintenance items shall not be eligible for funding from these funding sources. The department may, at its own discretion, approve or disapprove the use of these funds for items of grade crossing surface and roadway approach work. Federal funds obtained for high speed rail corridor grade crossing improvements, needed to accommodate trains at speeds exceeding 79 miles per hour, shall be expended prior to the use of those federal and state funds of the type referenced in subsection (3)(a) and (b) on a high speed rail corridor. No federal or state funds of the type referenced in subsection (3)(a) and (b) shall be expended for construction of grade separations on federally designated high speed rail corridors.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The department may, through routine inspections, periodically serve notice to affected parties, that existing devices and conditions exist at public grade crossings need corrective action. The railroads or road authorities, or both, shall, at their cost and according to their respective responsibility, expeditiously correct the deficiency and advise the department in writing when the work is completed.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 307.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A new public street, highway, or a new nonmotorized trail shall not be constructed across the tracks of any railroad, or the new tracks of any railroad shall not be constructed across a public street, highway, or nonmotorized trail until approval is granted by the department. Upon application, the department shall investigate the location of the proposed crossing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The department, when it determines necessary for the safety of the public, may change the location of or abolish any existing public grade crossing after not less than 30 days' notice in the area affected by the crossing. A public hearing shall be held by the department if requested by any affected party. Within 30 days after the date of the hearing, the department may issue an order to close the existing grade crossing. Any person, local unit of government, or road authority having an interest in the abolishment of an existing grade crossing, within 30 days after the closure order of the department, may commence an action in the circuit court for the county of Ingham against the department as defendant to vacate or set aside the order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Commencing with the date of the federal designation of a high-speed rail corridor, a public or private at-grade street or highway or a farm, bicycle, or pedestrian crossing shall not be constructed across the railroad tracks of that corridor except for a crossing consolidation or relocation approved by the department.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the location of a proposed crossing is found to be necessary, feasible, and may be made reasonably safe for a crossing at grade, the department shall grant permission for the crossing. The department shall require installation of such traffic control devices as in its judgment may be appropriate. When a crossing necessitated by a new roadway across an existing track is permitted, the department shall simultaneously, after investigation and hearing, order the abolishment of 1 or more existing grade crossings having less than 100 vehicles a day within the same road authority jurisdiction, if the involved road authority and railroad may waive hearing thereon.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the department determines that the proposed location may not be made reasonably safe for a grade crossing, it shall deny permission for the crossing and require the crossing to be redesigned, if constructed at that location, or to be made other than at grade in accordance with section 319. If the department determines that it is impractical to secure a safe crossing at the point in question, either at grade or otherwise, it shall deny the grade crossing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The full cost of constructing a new street or highway across an existing railroad, or of a new railroad track or tracks across an existing street or highway, shall be borne by the party requesting the crossing. The following shall apply to a new or relocated grade crossing:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The plans for the grade crossing shall be approved by both railroad and road authority. If there is a failure to agree, the department shall settle the points of disagreement by the terms of its order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The relocation of an existing grade crossing or the establishment of a new grade crossing at which the existing public highway grade crossing is completely abandoned, shall be constructed and the cost borne in the same manner as in the case of a new grade crossing. The maintenance responsibility of the relocated crossing shall be the same as the removed crossing unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Temporary grade crossings shall be constructed, maintained, and removed at the sole expense of the parties requesting the same.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The cost of construction shall include the direct construction cost of the roadbed, track structure, grade crossing surface, pavement, traffic control devices and drainage, including all material, labor, and services and other costs of construction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   After construction, the grade crossing and traffic control devices shall be maintained as provided in this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Upon approval of any new grade crossing project requested by a road authority, the road authority shall notify the railroad, in writing, to furnish a competent inspector and other necessary persons to inspect the construction of the grade crossing which shall be constructed according to the order of the department. The road authority shall pay to the railroad the actual costs incurred by the railroad for the time actually and necessarily spent in inspecting construction. Upon approval of any new grade crossing project requested by a railroad, the railroad shall notify the road authority, in writing, to furnish a competent inspector and other necessary persons to inspect the construction of the grade crossing which shall be constructed according to the order of the department. The railroad shall pay to the road authority the actual costs incurred by the road authority for the time actually and necessarily spent in inspecting construction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   A road authority may request a railroad or a railroad may request a road authority, in writing, to reconstruct, change, widen, or alter that portion of an existing grade crossing with a public street or highway for which they are responsible to accommodate the requesting party's plans for reconstruction, change, widening, or alteration of their crossing related facility. The requesting party shall notify the other party to conform to the change simultaneously with the requesting party's work. However, if the party requested to make changes refuses, the requesting party may make application to the department for a determination. The department, after due hearing on the issue, shall determine the matters in dispute by order. The full cost of the reconstructing, change, widening, or alteration shall be borne by the party requesting it, unless otherwise agreed to.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   If a track through any grade crossing is abandoned through legal proceedings, the railroad, at its cost as part of routine maintenance, shall remove the tracks and any active traffic control devices and then shall restore the street or highway surface in a manner satisfactory to the road authority. The road authority, at its cost as part of routine maintenance, shall remove all passive traffic control devices. The track and all traffic control devices shall be removed within 1 year of the abandonment. Until such removal is complete, the railroad and road authority shall maintain it in accordance with this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   If a track through any grade crossing becomes unnecessary for the conduct of railroad services, the railroad, at its cost as part of routine maintenance, shall remove the track and any active traffic control devices and then shall restore the street or highway surface in a manner satisfactory to the road authority. The road authority, at its cost as part of routine maintenance, shall remove all passive traffic control devices.

</P>
<P>Sec. 319.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The construction of a new highway/railroad grade separation structure or the total reconstruction of an existing grade separation structure shall require a written agreement between all affected railroads, the road authority, and any other parties required by law to participate in the construction or funding of the grade separation. As a minimum, the written agreement shall include the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A detailed statement of the work to be performed by each party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Methods of payment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A description of any work to be performed by the affected parties at no cost to the project.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Each party's share of the project cost.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   An itemized estimate of the cost of work to be performed by the railroad.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Methods to be used for performing the work, including contract and force account work.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Maintenance responsibilities.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   Form, duration, and amounts of any needed insurance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Appropriate reference to or identification of plans and specifications.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)   Statements defining the conditions under which the railroad will provide or require protective services during performance of the work, the type of protective services, and the method of reimbursement to the railroad.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(k)   Required minimum horizontal and vertical clearances for each track and roadway passing over or under the separation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(l)   A clause providing transfer of responsibilities to successive parties in the event of the change of ownership or jurisdiction of the railroad or highway.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(m)   The parties responsible to expeditiously remove the grade separation structure and cost responsibility if the grade separation is no longer needed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Each party signing the agreement shall receive an executed copy of the agreement and shall retain the agreement or a facsimile of the agreement for the life of the structure. If the roadway or railroad changes jurisdiction or ownership, the copy of the agreement shall be provided to the new affected party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The partial reconstruction of an existing highway/railroad grade separation, the alteration of an existing grade separation for increased railroad or highway facilities, or the removal of an existing grade separation shall be accomplished under the terms and conditions of the existing agreement or agreements covering the existing grade separation. If no agreement exists for the separation or if the existing agreement does not adequately address the proposed work, a new written agreement meeting the requirements of subsection (1) shall be executed before commencement of the work.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   For new construction, partial reconstruction, alteration, or removal of a grade separation, as provided for in subsections (1) and (2), where the affected parties cannot come to agreement, either the railroad or road authority may request, in writing, the department to order the construction, reconstruction, alteration, or removal of a grade separation. A request by a railroad or road authority shall include proposed profiles, plans, maps, and specifications showing the portions of the street or highway and the railroad or rairoads, for which the grade is to be changed or modified and the details of construction necessary for the improvements.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The department shall set a day for a hearing on the request and give written notice, together with a copy of the request, to all known interested parties in the proceeding at least 10 days before the day set for the hearing, and on the day set for hearing, or at any adjournment or continuance of the hearing, the parties in interest shall be entitled to be heard. The department may issue summonses or subpoenas to enforce the attendance of witnesses at the hearing and may make such examination of the location of the grade separation as it considers necessary.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If after the hearing the department finds that the separation of grades, the reconstruction of existing grade separations, or the alteration of existing grade separations for increased highway or railroad facilities is necessary for the public convenience, welfare, and safety, it may by proper order approve the separation of grades, the reconstruction of existing grade separations, or the alteration of existing grade separations for increased highway or railroad facilities, together with the profiles, plans, maps, and specifications to govern the work. If it finds that there is no such necessity, it may by proper order deny the request. The department, if in its judgment finds it is necessary for the public convenience, welfare, and safety, may change or alter the location of a grade separation. When existing grade crossings of any streets or highways with the railroad are near an involved grade separation, plans for which are approved pursuant to this act, and are situated within a reasonable distance of the site approved for grade separation, and when it is considered practical and reasonable to abolish any of such crossings by connecting the streets or highways to the highway directly served by the approved grade separation project, the department may order such crossings closed, may specify or approve the nature of connections to the highways interrupted by closing these crossings, and may require that the work be included as a part of the grade separation project. Profiles, plans, maps, and specifications for structures and railroad and highway approaches shall be prepared, unless otherwise agreed upon, by the party whose traffic is to be carried thereon, and likewise, unless otherwise agreed upon, the work of construction shall be performed by the party whose traffic is to be carried by such construction. However, if the profiles, plans, maps, and specifications of any party or parties have not been agreed to in writing by the other parties interested in the improvement before the day set for hearing on the application before the department, the department shall in its order prescribe the manner in which the separation of grades, the reconstruction of existing grade separations, or the alternation of existing grade separations shall be affected, fix and approve the profiles, plans, maps, and specifications, and in this behalf may approve in whole or in part, modify, or alter the plans submitted by the applicant.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Unless otherwise agreed upon, the cost of constructing and making separation of grades, the reconstruction of existing grade separations, or the alteration of existing grade separations for increased highway or railroad facilities, computed as provided in this act, shall be borne according to the benefits received, except that projects requested by the road authority shall not exceed 15% by the affected railroad with the balance paid by the road authority, and projects requested by the railroad shall not exceed 15% by the affected road authority with the balance paid by the railroad. If there is more than 1 affected railroad, and the railroads do not agree on the division of the amount to be borne by each, then the division shall be made by the order of the department. If the amount to be borne by more than 1 road authority is not agreed upon, the division of the amount to be borne by them shall be made by the order of the department.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Unless otherwise agreed upon, the department shall determine the parts or sections of a grade separation undertaking that shall be maintained by the railroad and the part or sections that shall be maintained by the road authority. Unless there are special conditions which complicate a direct allotment of the division of maintenance responsibilities, the maintenance of the structure and approaches and corresponding items of work shall be performed and the cost shall be borne entirely by the party whose traffic is carried thereon. The railroad shall repair or replace, at its own expense, any portions that may be damaged or destroyed by accident or otherwise arising from railroad traffic, and the road authority will repair or replace, at its own expense, any portions that may be damaged or destroyed by highway traffic.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   In computing the costs of an improvement, abuttal damages, property acquisition costs, engineering costs, all the other costs of construction, both temporary and permanent, including railroad and highway approaches to the structure incident to the separation of grades, reconstruction of existing grade separations, and the alteration of existing grade separations for increased highway or railroad facilities as set forth in the profiles, plans, maps, and specifications approved by the department may be considered. Additional property acquired or to be acquired for economizing the cost of the improvement and necessary to the grade separation structure and immediate approaches for preserving the existing railroad or highway may be considered a construction cost and included in the cost of the improvement.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 325.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The department, after notice and hearing, may order a railroad to erect and maintain such fencing along railroad right-of-way in agricultural areas as shall be necessary to prevent livestock from entry upon that right-of-way. Such fencing shall not be required unless the other boundaries of the property are fenced.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In agricultural areas, the cost and expense of installation, maintenance, and repair of fencing shall be borne by the railroad. However, if gates or cattle guards are necessitated by the existence of a farm crossing, the cost and expense of installation, maintenance, and repair of such gates or cattle guards shall be considered a cost of the crossing to be borne by the party requesting the gates or cattle guards.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The owner or proprietors of the adjacent farm lands, upon 30 days' written notice to the railroad, may erect or repair the fence and then may recover from the railroad in any court of competent jurisdiction the cost of the fence, together with reasonable compensation for labor in the construction of the fence. The railroad shall also be liable for damages caused by its agents, engines, or cars to livestock by reason of the livestock escaping due to failure to construct or maintain a fence.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The responsibility for and cost of installation, maintenance, and repair of fences in all other areas shall be borne by the property owner adjacent to the railroad unless the fencing is necessitated by the construction of new or the expansion of existing rail facilities, in which case the costs shall be borne by the railroad. The installation of fencing shall be consistent with the clearance requirement of this act. Conflicts between the parties shall be submitted to and decided by the department by order.</DIV>

Upon the filing of an application, the department may authorize the construction of the railroad track or sidetrack within a lesser distance from an adjacent railroad track or sidetrack as may be described in the application if, in the judgment of the department, compliance with the distance of 14 feet would be unreasonable, unnecessary, or impracticable, and the construction of the track within such lesser distance from an adjacent track will not create a hazardous condition to the employees of the person or persons engaged in the operation of the tracks. Nothing in subsection (5) or this subsection shall be construed to require the change of requirements between any railroad tracks or sidetracks existing on the effective date of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The department shall make an inspection within 30 days after receipt of a written complaint by an employee or union whose members are affected by a violation of this act, or upon a written complaint by a person, including a common carrier, affected by the violation, giving each party of interest 15 days' notice of the date of the inspection. The department may dispose of a complaint by denial for lack of merit in fact or law. The department shall issue a report to each interested party within 30 days after the inspection is conducted. If a party does not file a written objection to the report within 30 days after the transmittal of the report, the report shall become the order of the department.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 359.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The amount of alcohol or presence of a controlled substance or both in the operator's blood at the time alleged as shown by chemical analysis of that person's blood, urine, or breath shall be admissible into evidence in a criminal prosecution for any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A violation of section 353 or 357 or of a local ordinance substantially corresponding to section 353(1) or (2) or 357.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Manslaughter or murder resulting from the operation of a locomotive engine while the operator is alleged to have been impaired by or under the influence of alcoholic liquor or a controlled substance or a combination of alcoholic liquor and a controlled substance, or to have had a blood alcohol content of 0.04 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a test is given, the results of the test shall be made available to the person charged or the person's attorney upon written request to the prosecution, with a copy of the request filed with the court. The prosecution shall furnish the report at least 2 days before the day of the trial and the results shall be offered as evidence by the prosecution in that trial. Failure to fully comply with the request shall bar the admission of the results into evidence by the prosecution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except in a prosecution relating solely to a violation of section 353(2), the amount of alcohol in the operator's blood at the time alleged as shown by chemical analysis of that person's blood, urine, or breath shall give rise to the following presumptions:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If there was at the time less than 0.04% grams per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine, it shall be presumed that the person was not impaired by or under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If there was at the time 0.04% grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine, it shall be presumed that the person was impaired by or under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A sample or specimen of urine or breath shall be taken and collected in a reasonable manner. Only a licensed physician, or an individual operating under the delegation of a licensed physician under section 16215 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.16215, and qualified to withdraw blood acting in a medical environment, at the request of a peace officer, may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the amount of alcohol or presence of a controlled substance or both in the person's blood, as provided in this section. Liability for a crime or civil damages predicated on the act of withdrawing or analyzing blood and related procedures shall not attach to a licensed physician or individual operating under the delegation of a licensed physician who withdraws blood or analyzes blood or assists in the withdrawal or analysis in accordance with this section unless the withdrawal or analysis is performed in a negligent manner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The tests shall be administered at the request of a peace officer having probable cause to believe the person has committed a crime described in subsection (1). A person who takes a chemical test administered at the request of a peace officer, as provided in this section, shall be given a reasonable opportunity to have a person of his or her own choosing administer 1 of the chemical tests described in this section within a reasonable time after his or her detention. The results of the test shall be admissible and shall be considered with other admissible evidence in determining the innocence or guilt of the defendant. If the person charged is administered a chemical test by a person of his or her own choosing, the person charged is responsible for obtaining a chemical analysis of the test sample. The person charged shall be informed that after taking a test administered at the request of a peace officer he or she has the right to demand that a person of his or her own choosing administer 1 of the tests provided for in subsection (1), that the results of the test shall be admissible and shall be considered with other admissible evidence in determining the innocence or guilt of the defendant, and that the person charged is responsible for obtaining a chemical analysis of the test sample.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The person charged shall be advised that if the person refuses the request of a peace officer to take a test described in this section, a test shall not be given without a court order, but the officer may seek to obtain the court order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   This section shall not be construed as limiting the introduction of any other competent evidence, including a video tape recording taken of, and with prior notice to the person, bearing upon the question of whether or not the person was impaired by or under the influence of alcoholic liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination of alcoholic liquor and a controlled substance, or whether the person had a blood alcohol content of 0.04 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If a jury instruction regarding a defendant's refusal to submit to a chemical test under this section is requested by the prosecution or the defendant, the jury instruction shall be given as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Evidence was admitted in this case which, if believed by the jury, could prove that the defendant had exercised his or her right to refuse a chemical test. You are instructed that such a refusal is within the statutory rights of the defendant and is not evidence of his or her guilt. You are not to consider such a refusal in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   If after an accident the operator of a locomotive engine involved in the accident is transported to a medical facility and a sample of the operator's blood is withdrawn at that time for the purpose of medical treatment, the result of a chemical analysis of that sample is admissible in any criminal proceeding to show the amount of alcohol or presence of a controlled substance or both in the person's blood at the time alleged, regardless of whether the person had been offered or had refused a chemical test. The medical facility or person performing the chemical analysis shall disclose the results of the analysis to a prosecuting attorney who requests the results for use in a criminal prosecution as provided in this subsection. A medical facility or person disclosing information in compliance with this subsection is not civilly or criminally liable for making the disclosure.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   If after an accident the operator of a locomotive engine involved in the accident is deceased, a sample of the decedent's blood shall be withdrawn by the medical examiner or attending personnel of the medical facility in a manner directed by the medical examiner for the purpose of determining the amount of alcohol or presence of a controlled substance or both. The results of the blood testing shall be released to a prosecuting attorney for use in a criminal prosecution as provided in this section. A medical facility disclosing information in compliance with this subsection is not civilly or criminally liable for making the disclosure.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   The obtaining or analysis of a person's blood, breath, or urine under this section shall not be performed in a manner prohibited by the federal railroad administration, United States department of transportation.</DIV>
