        Am. 2002, Act 23, Imd. Eff. Mar. 4, 2002 <BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> Section 2 of Act 488 of 1980 provides: “This amendatory act shall not affect any instrument validly executed and acknowledged before the effective date of this amendatory act.”<BR><B>Former Law:</B> By the act of August 29, 1805, the clerk of every court was authorized to record all deeds and writings which were acknowledged or proved before such court, or any judge thereof, or any justice of the peace, or any notary public. If the party did not reside in Michigan the acknowledgment or proof was to be “before any court of law, or the mayor or any chief magistrate of any city, town, or corporation in which the party shall dwell, certified by such court, mayor, or magistrate, in the manner such acts are usually authenticated by them.” Woodward Code, p. 52, Secs. 87 and 89; Cass Code, p. 45; Terr. Laws, vol. 1, p. 38. Act of Sept. 16, 1810; Terr. Laws, vol. 1, p. 189, authorizes justices of the peace to take acknowledgments. By the act of 1820, deeds were required to be signed and sealed by the parties, and acknowledged or proved by one or more of the subscribing witnesses thereto, before one of the judges of the supreme court, or one of the justices of any county court, a notary public, or justice of the peace. Code of 1820, p. 157; Terr. Laws, vol. 1, p. 516. Deeds executed in any other territory, state, or country, were required to be acknowledged or proved and certified according to the laws and usages of such territory, state, or country. The provisions of the act of 1820 were substantially re-enacted in 1827, and continued in force until August 31, 1838. Revision of 1827, p. 258, and 1833, p. 279; Terr. Laws, vol. 2, p. 361. By the R.S. 1838, p. 257, acknowledgments might be made “before any judge of any court of record, or before any notary public or justice of the peace within the state or of the United States, or in any foreign country, or before any minister or consul of the United States in any foreign country.” And provision was made for proving deeds before a court of record, in case the grantor should die or depart from the state without having acknowledged the same. R.S. 1838, as amended by Act 115 of 1839, Sec. 17, p. 219, required two witnesses. R.S. 1838 required no witnesses to a deed. By Act 108 of 1840, p. 166, deeds might be acknowledged before a justice of the peace, judge of the circuit, district, or supreme courts of the state, or notary public, or master in chancery. If executed by a person residing in any other state or territory, the deed was required to be executed according to the laws of such state or territory. If executed by a person residing in a foreign country, it might be executed according to the laws of such country, and acknowledged before a minister plenipotentiary, consul, or charge d'affaires of the United States. This act was in force until repealed by the R.S. 1846. For acts respecting conveyances by the governor and judges, and by the mayor, recorder, and aldermen of Detroit, see Laws of 1834, p. 38; Act 47 of 1844, p. 60, as amended by Act 108 of 1846, p. 156; and Act 228 of 1850, p. 232.</p>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In the cases provided for in the last preceding section unless the acknowledgment be taken before a commissioner appointed by the governor of this state for that purpose the officer taking such acknowledgment shall attach thereto the seal of his office, and if such acknowledgment be taken before a justice of the peace or other officer having no seal of office, such deed or other conveyance or instrument shall have attached thereto a certificate of the clerk or other proper certifying officer of a court of record of the county or district, or of the secretary of the state or territory within which such acknowledgment was taken under the seal of his office, that the person whose name is subscribed to the certificate of acknowledgment was, at the date thereof, such officer as he is therein represented to be, and that he believes the signature of such person to such certificate of acknowledgment to be genuine, and that the deed is executed and acknowledged according to the laws of such state, territory or district. Whenever any deed or other instrument affecting the title to land, executed, acknowledged and authenticated in accordance with this section and the last preceding section, has been heretofore recorded in the proper county, such record, or a certified transcript thereof shall be prima facie evidence of the due execution of such instrument to the same extent as if it had been authenticated as required by the statute in force at the time such instrument was recorded.</DIV>

Amendatory Act 115 of 1839, Sec. 34, p. 219, to R.S. 1838, which took effect 30 days thereafter, provided that “no register of deeds shall record any deed executed out of this state, unless there shall be attached thereto the official certificate of the proper certifying officer, showing that the officer taking the acknowledgment of such deed is such officer as by his certificate of acknowledgment he purports to be, duly commissioned and qualified.” Act 108 of 1840, p. 166, which took effect Apr. 1, 1840, required that when the deed was executed in any other state or territory it should have attached thereto a certificate of the proper county clerk, under the seal of his office, that such deed was executed according to the laws of such state or territory. Act 5 of 1843, p. 6, effective Feb. 15, 1843, required that when the deed was executed in any other state or territory it should have attached thereto a certificate of the clerk or proper certifying officer of any court of record in such state or territory, under the seal of his office, that such deed was executed and acknowledged according to the laws of such state or territory. This provision continued in force until R.S. 1846.</p>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Upon delivery of an instrument to the register of deeds for the purpose of recording, the register shall note the date, hour, and minute of delivery on the first page of the instrument using a stamp or other method signifying that the date, hour, and minute was affixed by the register or a duly authorized representative of the register. If the instrument is received in bulk with other instruments, the date, hour, and minute of delivery shall be affixed in the manner required by this section as soon as is practical after its delivery. The date, hour, and minute so noted shall be presumed to be the date and time of delivery.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Each instrument delivered to a register shall be accessible for public review. Accessibility shall be satisfied by providing the instrument inscribed in a tangible medium when requested. The requirement of this subsection shall be considered to be satisfied if the length of time between a request to locate a particular document or documents and the time the search is initiated and completed is reasonable in light of the volume of all instruments being recorded and the ability to access the requested documents without undue disruption to the office of the register. A register of deeds also may, but is not required to, do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Provide at least the first page of the instrument, stored in an electronic or other medium.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Provide a temporary searchable journal containing at least the date of delivery, title of the instrument, and the names of the parties to the instrument.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Any information created or maintained under subsection (2) may be destroyed when the instrument is entered into the index described in section 28 of this chapter or when the instrument is not accepted for recording.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A register shall not charge a fee for any review or search under subsection (2) unless it involves the search of an original instrument. An original instrument is available for public review only in the presence of the register, deputy register, or a representative of the register appointed for that purpose. When a name search is performed by the register or a representative of the register, a reasonable fee, not to exceed $15.00 for each 15 minutes or fraction thereof, may be charged for any search or review requested. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Subsections (2) to (4) do not apply once the instrument is indexed as required in section 28 of this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The register of deeds shall post in a conspicuous place in the register's office the general index date and shall maintain a record that memorializes both the calendar date and general index date that was posted on that calendar date. This public record shall be maintained in any reasonable medium that the register of deeds may select in his or her sole discretion. As used in this subsection, "general index date" means that date through which all recorded instruments bearing a delivery date up to and including the general index date have been fully recorded at length and indexed and are available for public inspection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a county register of deeds or an officer, employee, or agent of a register of deeds is, or believes he or she is, acting within the scope of his or her authority and in the course of his or her employment when authorizing, conducting, or deciding when or whether to conduct a search under subsection (2), that action is within the exercise or discharge of his or her governmental function, and the register of deeds or the officer, employee, or agent is immune from any claim for liability, including tort liability, that might otherwise entitle any person or other entity or corporation to monetary damages. The civil immunity provided under this section is in addition to any civil immunity provided under law, including, but not limited to, the application of section 7 of 1964 PA 170, MCL 691.1407.</div>

However, except as to mineral interests, if the claim is founded on a recorded instrument, the notice must also state the liber and page or other county-assigned unique identifying number of the recorded instrument the claim is founded on. The failure to include the liber and page or other county-assigned unique identifying number renders the recording ineffective and the claim unpreserved. The notice must contain all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The claimant's name.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The claimant's mailing address.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The interest claimed to be preserved.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The claimant's signature.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A notice of claim under section 3 must be filed for record in the register of deeds office of the county or counties where the land described in the notice is located. The register of deeds of each county shall accept all notices of claim under section 3 that are presented to the register of deeds that describe land located in the county in which the register of deeds serves and shall enter and record full copies of the notices in the same way that deeds and other instruments are recorded. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A register of deeds is entitled to charge the same fees for the recording of a notice under section 3 as are charged for recording deeds.

        CL 1948, 565.281 <BR><B>Former Law:</B> See section 2 of Act 104 of 1875. The act of Aug. 29, 1805, provided that “when husband and wife have sealed and delivered a writing, if the wife appear before such court” (which it would seem must be a court of record), “judge, justice, or notary public, and being examined privily and apart from her husband, shall declare that she did freely and willingly seal and deliver the said writing, to be then shown and explained to her, and wishes not to retract it, and consenteth that it may be recorded, a certificate of such privy examination being returned and recorded with the writing; and the writing being acknowledged also by the husband, or proved by witnesses to be his act, in such case the said writing shall not only be sufficient to convey or release any right of dower thereby intended to be released or conveyed, but be as effectual for every other purpose as if she were an unmarried woman.” Woodward Code, p. 53: Cass Code, page 45; Terr. Laws, vol. 1, p. 39. If the grantor did not reside in Michigan, no different acknowledgment seemed to be required of the married woman than of any other person; but the deed, executed as before stated in the case of non-residents, together with any relinquishment of dower, was to “be effectual.” The act of May 27, 1820, provided that no estate of a feme covert residing in this territory should pass by her deed without a previous acknowledgment made “on a private examination apart from her husband, that she executed such deed freely, without any fear or compulsion of her husband;” but where any feme covert not residing in the territory should join with her husband in any deed or conveyance of, or relating to any lands or real estate within the territory, it might be executed and acknowledged in all respects as if she were sole, and she should thereby be barred of all claim of dower, and all other right and title therein as if she were sole. Code of 1820, p. 159; Terr. Laws, vol. 1, p. 518. This provision was re-enacted in 1827, and continued in force until and including August 31, 1838, when it was repealed by the Revised Statutes of that year. See revision of 1827, p. 259; and 1833, p. 280; Terr. Laws, vol. 2, p. 362. The Revised Statutes of 1838 required the acknowledgment of the wife to be taken separately and apart from her husband, and that she should acknowledge that she executed the deed without any fear or compulsion of her husband, p. 258, Sec. 11. And to bar her dower she must in the deed release her claim thereto, p. 263, Sec. 7. Sec. 4 of Act 108, 1840, p. 167, provided that the right of dower which a married woman might have in the state should not be passed or conveyed except by deed executed by her, to be acknowledged by her on a private examination, separate and apart from her husband, that she had executed the deed without fear or compulsion from any one. This provision, it will be seen, relates only to the release of dower. It was in force until Mar. 1, 1847, when the Revised Statutes of 1846 took effect.</p>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A vendor or a vendee under a land contract may grant a land contract mortgage to secure any debt or obligation that may be secured by a real estate mortgage. This subsection does not alter the effect of any contractual provisions which prohibit or result in a default upon the mortgage, sale, assignment, or further encumbrance of a vendor's or vendee's interest in a land contract which would otherwise be enforceable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For the purposes of sections 6 to 11, the respective interests of a vendor or a vendee subject to a land contract mortgage includes all of the respective rights of a vendor or vendee including, without limitation, the vendor's rights to payments and the vendee's rights to conveyance. For the purposes of sections 6 to 11, the interests of vendors and vendees subject to a land contract mortgage are real property interests.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Unless otherwise provided by the parties, a land contract mortgage encumbers all of the vendor's or vendee's interests that are mortgaged, whether real, personal, or mixed, in the same manner and to the same extent as a real estate mortgage.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the land contract mortgage contains a collateral assignment of the payments of the vendee under the land contract, delivery to the vendee of a notice of default signed under oath by the land contract mortgagee asserting that a default exists under the land contract mortgage together with a copy of the recorded land contract mortgage containing the collateral assignment and a demand that all further payments under the land contract be made to the land contract mortgagee, after which all payments shall thereafter be made in accordance with that notice.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A third party asserting a prior lien or interest to that of a land contract mortgagee whose land contract mortgage has been recorded shall do all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Provide to the land contract mortgagee copies of all notices that must be provided to the vendor or vendee as a prerequisite to the assertion or enforcement of the third party rights or remedies, but only to the extent that those notices would be required to be provided if the vendor or vendee were the fee owner of the real property and the land contract mortgage were a mortgage upon the fee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Name the land contract mortgagee as a party in interest in any legal proceeding, the effect of which would be to terminate, assert, or enforce a prior lien or encumbrance upon the vendor's or vendee's interest that is subject to the land contract mortgage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Accept from the land contract mortgagee any payment, performance, or cure that the third party would be obligated to accept from the vendor or the vendee.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 11.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)    When the vendee named in a land contract, or his or her heirs, successors, or assigns, has fully paid and performed the obligations under the contract that are a precondition to the sale and conveyance of the land, the vendor named in the contract shall make conveyance of the land to the vendee by a deed of conveyance as specified in the land contract, or, if the form of the deed is not specified in the land contract, by an appropriate deed. Until the vendor named in the contract has ceased in law to be bound by the provisions of the contract, the obligation to convey the land remains a continuing executory obligation on the part of the vendor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The vendor named in the land contract who has assigned his or her interest in the contract or sold or mortgaged the land subject to the contract, whether absolutely or as collateral security, shall remain fully obligated to deliver a deed of conveyance as provided in subsection (1). However, if the assignee assumed the conveyancing obligation of the vendor, the original vendor is only secondarily liable for that obligation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   When the vendee named in a land contract, or his or her heirs, successors, or assigns, has fully paid and performed the obligations that are a precondition to the sale and conveyance of the land subject to the contract, the assignee and all succeeding assignees, including the holder of a land contract vendor's interest who has become the absolute holder of that interest as a result of security enforcement procedures after an assignment of the vendor's interest as collateral security, and the grantee, and all succeeding grantees including any grantee pursuant to a mortgage foreclosure regarding a mortgage made upon the land but subject to the land contract in any deed of the land given subject to the land contract by the vendor, shall make the conveyance of the land to the vendee. The conveyance shall be made as specified in the land contract if the vendor's assignee or grantee has assumed the vendor's continuing executory conveyancing obligation, or by quitclaim deed if the vendor's assignee or grantee has not assumed the vendor's conveyancing obligation. However, an assignee named in the contract who has not assumed the conveyancing obligation of the vendor and who has reassigned the entire vendor's interest and, therefore, retains no further interest, whether absolute or as security, has no obligation to provide a deed of conveyance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   When the vendee named in the land contract, or his or her heirs, successors, or assigns, has fully paid and performed the obligations under the contract that are a precondition to the sale and conveyance of the land, the land contract mortgagee under any land contract mortgage of the land made by the vendor subject to the land contract, or the assignee of any assignment for collateral security purposes of the vendor's interest under the land contract, shall execute a discharge of the land contract mortgage or a release of the security assignment in the same manner as now provided by law for the discharge of mortgages. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   When the vendor named in the land contract has ceased in law to be bound by the provisions of the contract, and is entitled to a release from the contract, the vendee named in the contract, or his or her heirs, successors, or assigns, including, without limitation, any land contract mortgagees or other parties claiming a lien or security interest upon or in the vendee's interests in the contract, shall, when requested by the vendor, execute a discharge of the contract in the same manner as now provided by law for the discharge of mortgages.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A person who is required under this section to enter into a conveyance or discharge and who fails or refuses to make the conveyance or discharge is subject to the same penalties, and to any other penalties or remedies existing before the effective date of this act, as are now provided by law for a refusal to discharge a real estate mortgage after the real estate mortgage has been fully paid. The party entitled to the conveyance or discharge may enforce the conveyance or discharge as provided in section 44 of 1846 RS 65, MCL 565.44, for enforcing the discharge of mortgages. The petition or bill asking for the discharge shall contain all the material averments regarding the matter as required by that section in regard to mortgages, as applicable to land contracts. However, a land contract is not invalid for want of acknowledgment or recording. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   This section does not render a title unmarketable if that title would otherwise have been marketable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   For the purposes of this act, a mortgage, deed, or land contract is subject to another real estate interest if, by its terms or by an independent voluntary subordination, it is subordinate to the other real estate interest or, as a matter of law, it would be automatically subordinate to the other real estate interest.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 5.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The transferor or his or her agent is not liable for any error, inaccuracy, or omission in any information delivered pursuant to this act if the error, inaccuracy, or omission was not within the personal knowledge of the transferor, or was based entirely on information provided by public agencies or provided by other persons specified in subsection (3), and ordinary care was exercised in transmitting the information. It is not a violation of this act if the transferor fails to disclose information that could be obtained only through inspection or observation of inaccessible portions of real estate or could be discovered only by a person with expertise in a science or trade beyond the knowledge of the transferor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The delivery of any information required by this act to be disclosed to a prospective transferee by a public agency or other person specified in subsection (3) shall be considered to comply with the requirements of this act and relieves the transferor of any further duty under this act with respect to that item of information, unless the transferor has knowledge of a known defect or condition that contradicts the information provided by the public agency or the person specified in subsection (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The delivery of a report or opinion prepared by a licensed professional engineer, professional surveyor, geologist, structural pest control operator, contractor, or other expert, dealing with matters within the scope of the professional's license or expertise, is sufficient compliance for application of the exemption provided by subsection (1) if the information is provided upon the request of the prospective transferee, unless the transferor has knowledge of a known defect or condition that contradicts the information contained in the report or opinion. In responding to a request by a prospective transferee, an expert may indicate, in writing, an understanding that the information provided will be used in fulfilling the requirements of section 7 and, if so, shall indicate the required disclosures, or parts of disclosures, to which the information being furnished applies. In furnishing the statement, the expert is not responsible for any items of information other than those expressly set forth in the statement. </DIV>

  </table><B></B>Purpose of Statement: This statement is a disclosure of the condition of the property in compliance with the seller disclosure act. This statement is a disclosure of the condition and information concerning the property, known by the seller. Unless otherwise advised, the seller does not possess any expertise in construction, architecture, engineering, or any other specific area related to the construction or condition of the improvements on the property or the land. Also, unless otherwise advised, the seller has not conducted any inspection of generally inaccessible areas such as the foundation or roof. This statement is not a warranty of any kind by the seller or by any agent representing the seller in this transaction, and is not a substitute for any inspections or warranties the buyer may wish to obtain.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Seller's Disclosure: The seller discloses the following information with the knowledge that even though this is not a warranty, the seller specifically makes the following representations based on the seller's knowledge at the signing of this document. Upon receiving this statement from the seller, the seller's agent is required to provide a copy to the buyer or the agent of the buyer. The seller authorizes its agent(s) to provide a copy of this statement to any prospective buyer in connection with any actual or anticipated sale of property. The following are representations made solely by the seller and are not the representations of the seller's agent(s), if any. THIS INFORMATION IS A DISCLOSURE ONLY AND IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A PART OF ANY CONTRACT BETWEEN BUYER AND SELLER.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Instructions to the Seller: (1) Answer ALL questions. (2) Report known conditions affecting the property. (3) Attach additional pages with your signature if additional space is required. (4) Complete this form yourself. (5) If some items do not apply to your property, check NOT AVAILABLE. If you do not know the facts, check UNKNOWN. FAILURE TO PROVIDE A PURCHASER WITH A SIGNED DISCLOSURE STATEMENT WILL ENABLE A PURCHASER TO TERMINATE AN OTHERWISE BINDING PURCHASE AGREEMENT.
