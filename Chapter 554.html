</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>554.92 Vesting of future interests; timing; exceptions; definitions.</B><P>Sec. 2.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in subsection (2), the period during which the vesting of a future interest in property may be postponed by the exercise of a second power is determined under the uniform statutory rule against perpetuities by reference to the time of the creation of the power of appointment that subjected property to, or created, the second power. Except as provided in subsection (2), a nonvested interest, a general power of appointment not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent, or a nongeneral or testamentary power of appointment created, or to which property is subjected, by the exercise of the second power is invalid to the extent of the exercise of the second power unless the interest or power satisfies the uniform statutory rule against perpetuities measured from the time of the creation of the power of appointment that subjected property to, or created, the second power.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) To the extent a second power is created or has property subjected to it by the exercise of a first power, subsection (1) does not apply to any future interest created by exercise of the second power if the instrument exercising the first power to subject property to or create the second power expressly declares that subsection (1) does not apply to any future interest created by exercise of the second power or, if the second power is a nonfiduciary power, otherwise clearly indicates that the donee of the first power intends to spring the so-called Delaware tax trap by subjecting property to or creating the second power. For purposes of an express declaration that subsection (1) does not apply, subsection (1) may be referred to as the anti-Delaware-tax-trap provision of the personal property trust perpetuities act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Fiduciary" means, with respect to a power of appointment, that the power is held by a trustee in a fiduciary capacity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "First power" means a nonfiduciary, nongeneral power of appointment over personal property held in trust that is exercised so as to subject the property to, or to create, another power of appointment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Nonfiduciary" means, with respect to a power of appointment, that the power of appointment is not held by a trustee in a fiduciary capacity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Second-order fiduciary power" means a fiduciary power of appointment that is created or has property subjected to it by the exercise of 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A first power.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A fiduciary power of appointment that was created or had property subjected to it by the exercise of a first power.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) A fiduciary power of appointment whose creation or control over property subject to the power is traceable through an unbroken succession of previous exercises of fiduciary powers to the exercise of a fiduciary power that was created or had property subjected to it by the exercise of a first power.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) "Second power" means a power of appointment over personal property held in trust, other than a presently exercisable general power, that is created or to which property is subjected by the exercise of either a first power or a second-order fiduciary power.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) "Uniform statutory rule against perpetuities" means the uniform statutory rule against perpetuities, 1988 PA 418, MCL 554.71 to 554.78.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided otherwise in this section, an estate at will or by sufferance may be terminated by either party by giving 1 month's notice to the other party. If the rent reserved in a lease is payable at periods of less than 3 months, the time of notice is sufficient if it is equal to the interval between the times of payment. Notice is not void because it states a day for the termination of the tenancy that does not correspond to the conclusion or commencement of a rental period. The notice terminates the tenancy at the end of a period equal in length to the interval between times of payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a tenant neglects or refuses to pay rent on a lease at will or otherwise, the landlord may terminate the tenancy by giving the tenant a written 7-day notice to quit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A tenancy from year to year may be terminated by either party by a notice to quit, given at any time to the other party. The notice shall terminate the lease at the expiration of 1 year from the time of the service of the notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a tenant holds over after a lease is terminated pursuant to a clause in the lease providing for termination because the tenant, a member of the tenant's household, or other person under the tenant's control has manufactured, delivered, possessed with intent to deliver, or possessed a controlled substance on the leased premises, the landlord may terminate the tenancy by giving the tenant a written 24-hour notice to quit. This subsection applies only if a formal police report has been filed alleging that the person has unlawfully manufactured, delivered, possessed with intent to deliver, or possessed a controlled substance on the leased premises. For purposes of this subsection, "controlled substance" means a substance or a counterfeit substance classified in schedule 1, 2, or 3 pursuant to sections 7211 to 7216 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7211 to 333.7216.</div>

The notice shall be verified by oath and shall describe the land and the nature of the interest claimed, give the name and address of the person or persons claiming the interest, and state that the person or persons desire to preserve the interest and do not intend to abandon the interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A person other than the owner of the surface holding interests in oil or gas in any land for use in underground gas storage operations may preserve the oil or gas interests, and the rights of any lessor of the oil or gas interests, by recording a single written notice defining the boundaries of and the formations included in the underground gas storage field or pool within which the oil or gas interests are located, without the necessity of describing each separate oil or gas interest claimed in that underground gas storage field or pool by that person. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A possessor of a fee, reversionary, or easement interest in land, including an owner, lessee, or other lawful occupant, owes no duty of care to a trespasser and is not liable to a trespasser for physical harm caused by the possessor's failure to exercise reasonable care to put the land in a condition reasonably safe for the trespasser or to carry on activities on the land so as not to endanger trespassers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), a possessor of land may be subject to liability for physical injury or death to a trespasser if any of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The possessor injured the trespasser by willful and wanton misconduct.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The possessor was aware of the trespasser's presence on the land, or in the exercise of ordinary care should have known of the trespasser's presence on the land, and failed to use ordinary care to prevent injury to the trespasser arising from active negligence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The possessor knew, or from facts within the possessor's knowledge should have known, that trespassers constantly intrude on a limited area of the land and the trespasser was harmed as a result of the possessor's failure to carry on an activity in that limited area involving a risk of death or serious bodily harm with reasonable care for the trespasser's safety.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The trespasser is a child injured by an artificial condition on the land and all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The possessor knew or had reason to know that a child would be likely to trespass on the place where the condition existed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The possessor knew or had reason to know of the condition and realized or should have realized that the condition would involve an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm to a child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The injured child, because of his or her youth, did not discover the condition or realize the risk involved in intermeddling with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The utility to the possessor of maintaining the condition and the burden of eliminating the danger were slight as compared with the risk to the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) The possessor failed to exercise reasonable care to eliminate the danger or otherwise to protect the child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) This section does not increase the liability of a possessor of land and does not affect any immunity from or defenses to civil liability established by or available under the statutes or common law of this state to which a possessor of land is entitled.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A tenant who has a reasonable apprehension of present danger to the tenant or his or her child from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking while that person is a tenant shall be released from his or her rental payment obligation in accordance with the requirements of this section after submittal of written notice of his or her intent to seek a release and written documentation that the tenant has a reasonable apprehension of present danger to the tenant or his or her child from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Submittal of written notice shall be made by certified mail. A rental agreement may contain a provision stating "A tenant who has a reasonable apprehension of present danger to him or her or his or her child from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking may have special statutory rights to seek a release of rental obligation under MCL 554.601b.". If the rental agreement does not contain such a provision, the landlord shall post written notice visible to a reasonable person in the landlord's property management office or deliver written notice to the tenant when the lease agreement is signed. The content of the written notice shall be identical to the provision in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The tenant shall include in the submittal required under subsection (1) a written statement that the tenant or a child of the tenant has a reasonable apprehension of present danger from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. For purposes of releasing a tenant from his or her obligation to pay rent, the tenant is released from an obligation to pay rent no later than the first day of the second month that rent is due after notice is given. A release of a rental obligation under this section does not apply to prepaid amounts, including, but not limited to, prepayment of first and last months' rent. A release of rental obligation under this section does not take effect before the tenant vacates the premises. Nothing in this section shall prevent a landlord from withholding security deposits pursuant to section 13(1)(d). This subsection does not affect other sums that may be withheld by the landlord under this act or other applicable law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The requirement in subsection (1) that a tenant provide written documentation that the tenant has a reasonable apprehension of present danger to the tenant or his or her child from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking is satisfied by providing 1 or more of the following written documents to the landlord:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A valid personal protection order or foreign protection order as defined in section 2950h of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.2950h, or an order removing an abusive person from a home under MCL 712A.13a(4), issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that remains in effect on the date of submittal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A valid probation order, conditional release order, or parole order that is still in effect on the date of submittal if the probation order, conditional release order, or parole order indicates that the individual subject to the order is subject to conditions reasonably necessary to protect the tenant or child of the tenant, including a condition that the individual is to have no contact with the tenant or child of the tenant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A written police report that has resulted in the filing of charges by the prosecuting attorney that has jurisdiction over the matter if the charges were filed not more than 14 days before submittal of the written notice required under subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A written police report that has resulted in the filing of charges by the prosecuting attorney that has jurisdiction over the matter if the charges were filed more than 14 days before submittal of the written notice required under subsection (1). A tenant who uses a police report under this subdivision shall demonstrate a verifiable threat of present danger from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Filing of the form under subdivision (e) shall be a demonstration of a verifiable threat of present danger from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Within 45 days after termination of the occupancy and not thereafter the landlord may commence an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for a money judgment for damages which he has claimed or in lieu thereof return the balance of the security deposit held by him to the tenant or any amount mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties. A landlord shall not be entitled to retain any portion of a security deposit for damages claimed unless he has first obtained a money judgment for the disputed amount or filed with the court satisfactory proof of an inability to obtain service on the tenant or unless:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The tenant has failed to provide a forwarding address as required by section 11.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The tenant has failed to respond to the notice of damages as required by section 12.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   As used in this act:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Rental agreement" means a written agreement embodying the terms and conditions concerning the use and occupancy of residential premises, but does not include an agreement the terms of which are limited to 1 or more of the following: the identity of the parties, a description of the premises, the rental period, the total rental amount due, the amount of rental payments, and the times at which payments are due.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A rental agreement shall not include a provision that does 1 or more of the following:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Exculpates the lessor from liability for the lessor's failure to perform, or negligent performance of, a duty imposed by law.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Provides that rental payments may be accelerated if the rental agreement is breached by the tenant, unless the provision also includes a statement that the tenant may not be liable for the total accelerated amount because of the landlord's obligation to minimize damages, and that either party may have a court determine the actual amount owed, if any.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)   Waives or alters a party's rights with respect to possession or eviction proceedings provided in section 2918 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.2918, or with respect to summary proceedings to recover possession as provided in chapter 57 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.5701 to 600.5759.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(k)   Releases a party from a duty to mitigate damages.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(l)   Provides that a lessor may alter a provision of the rental agreement after its commencement without the written consent of the tenant, or, in the case of a rental agreement between a consumer cooperative that provides housing and a member of the consumer cooperative, without the approval of the board of directors of the cooperative or other appropriate body elected by members who are also tenants of the cooperative, except that an agreement may provide for the following types of adjustments to be made upon written notice of not less than 30 days:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Changes required by federal, state, or local law or rule or regulation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Changes in rules relating to the property that are required to protect the physical health, safety, or peaceful enjoyment of tenants and guests.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(m)   Violates the Michigan consumer protection act, 1976 PA 331, MCL 445.901 to 445.922.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(n)   Requires the tenant to give the lessor a power of attorney.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A rental agreement shall not include a clause or provision that, not less than 90 days before the execution of the rental agreement, has been prohibited by statute or declared unenforceable by a published decision of the supreme court of this state or the United States supreme court relating to the law of this state.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a rental agreement contains a provision which violates section 3, and if the landlord fails to cure the violation by exercising the notice provisions of section 5 within 20 days after the tenant gives written notice to the landlord of the provision believed to be in violation and the reason therefor, a tenant may bring an action for any of the following relief:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   To void the rental agreement and terminate the tenancy.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   To enjoin the lessor from including the provision in any rental agreement subsequently entered into and to require the lessor to exercise the notice procedure provided in section 5 to cure the violation in all rental agreements in which the provision occurs and to which the lessor is currently a party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   To recover damages in the amount of $250.00 per action, or actual damages, whichever is greater.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a rental agreement fails to contain a provision as required by section 4 or contains a provision which is explicitly and unambiguously prohibited by section 3, and if the landlord fails to cure the violation by exercising the notice provisions of section 5 within 20 days after the tenant, or, where there is more than one plaintiff, each tenant, gives written notice to the landlord of the provision required by section 4 or absence of a provision believed to be in violation and the reason therefor, a tenant may bring an action for any of the following relief:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   To avoid the rental agreement and terminate the tenancy.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   To enjoin the lessor from including the provision which violates section 3 in any rental agreement subsequently entered into and to require the lessor to exercise the notice procedure provided in section 5 to cure the violation in all rental agreements in which the provision occurs and to which the lessor is currently a party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   To enjoin the lessor from failing to comply with section 4 in any rental agreement subsequently entered into and to require the lessor to exercise the notice procedure provided in section 5 to cure the violation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   To recover damages in the amount of $500.00, or actual damages, whichever is greater.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A tenant may exercise the remedies of this section without the prior notice to the landlord required by subsections (1) and (2) under any of the following circumstances:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If a rental agreement contains a provision which has previously been determined by a court of record to be in violation of section 3 in an action to which the lessor was a party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If a rental agreement contains a provision which the lessor actually knew was in violation of section 3 at the time the rental agreement was entered into.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If a rental agreement does not include a provision as required by section 4 and the lessor actually knew that the provision was not included as required at the time the rental agreement was entered into. As used in subdivisions (b) and (c), "actual knowledge" shall be established by written documentation, evidencing the actual knowledge, written or issued by the lessor or an agent of the lessor who is authorized to execute rental agreements or by an admission, evidencing the actual knowledge, made by the lessor or an agent of the lessor who is authorized to execute rental agreements or by showing the lessor has previously given notice under section 5 relating to the same provision which is the subject of the current action.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A party who prevails in an action under this section is entitled to recover court costs plus statutory attorney fees.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   All actions brought under subsection (1) with respect to a particular provision of a rental agreement shall be joined, and only 1 judgment for damages of $250.00 shall be awarded with respect to a particular provision even if there are multiple actions or multiple plaintiffs if, before judgment in the initial action and before the passage of 30 days after service of process in any second action, the lessor gives written notice to all tenants who are currently subject to that provision, stating that the enforceability of the provision is under dispute and may be determined by a court of law. However, this subsection does not prohibit a tenant from recovering actual damages, if any, with respect to an unlawful provision of a rental agreement. As used in this subsection, "action" means a court action instituted by a single plaintiff, a representative plaintiff, or multiple plaintiffs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If a rental agreement contains the provisions as required by section 4 but contains a provision which violates this act, solely because of a judicial construction by a court of record of a provision of a statute cited in section 3 in an action to which the lessor was a party, the lessor shall not be subject to the penalties of this act unless the lessor fails to cure the violation by exercising the notice provisions of section 5 within 30 days following the final determination by the court. For purposes of this subsection, section 39(2) of chapter 66 of the Revised Statutes of 1846, being section 554.139 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, shall not be considered to have been judicially construed as of the effective date of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   For purposes of this section, "tenant" means a person who is currently a party to a rental agreement with the lessor.</DIV>

The advertisement shall include all of the following:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The address of the campground and, if known to the operator, the name of the occupant and the name of the titleholder of the personal property.</DIV>

Upon receipt of this payment, the operator shall return the personal property to the occupant, titleholder, or lienholder who made the payment, in the same condition, or substantially the same condition, as it was in when it was left at the campground by the occupant.</DIV>

A payment made to the operator shall be added to the amount of the lien of the prior lienholder who made the payment, and shall be subtracted from the amount of the operator's lien.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   A purchaser in good faith of the personal property sold under this section takes the property free of any rights of persons against whom the lien was valid, despite noncompliance by the operator with the requirements of this section.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   In a sale under this section, the party conducting the sale shall distribute the proceeds in the following sequence:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   First, to satisfy the operator's lien pursuant to section 7, minus any amount already paid to the operator pursuant to subsection (9).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Second, to satisfy outstanding balances owed to prior perfected lienholders.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Third, in the case of the sale of a motor vehicle, boat, or recreational vehicle, the title to which is held by a person other than the occupant, any proceeds remaining after the distribution is made under subdivision (a) or (b) shall be returned to the titleholder of the motor vehicle, boat, or recreational vehicle.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Fourth, any proceeds of the sale remaining after the distribution is made under subdivision (a), (b), or (c) shall be returned to the occupant by mailing the proceeds to the occupant's last known address by certified mail and by notifying the occupant by first-class mail. If the occupant does not claim the remaining proceeds within 2 years after the date of sale, the remaining proceeds shall escheat to the state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   The operator shall maintain proper records of money received in any sale held under this section, and the records shall be subject to audit by the state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(14)   The operator shall dispose of any property offered for sale but not purchased by donating it to a charitable organization or, if the property is not accepted by a charitable organization, by any other means.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(15)   An occupant who suffers damages because of an operator's failure to comply with this act may bring an action in a court of appropriate jurisdiction for the actual amount of the damages or $250.00, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorney's fees.</DIV>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>554.1026 "Good faith" defined; use or transfer of receivership property not in ordinary course of business.</B><P>Sec. 16.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As used in this section, "good faith" means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) With court approval, a receiver may use receivership property other than in the ordinary course of business.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) With court approval, and after notice and an opportunity for a hearing is given to all creditors and other known interested parties unless the court orders otherwise for cause, a receiver may transfer receivership property other than in the ordinary course of business by sale, lease, license, exchange, or other disposition. Unless the agreement of sale provides otherwise, a sale under this section is free and clear of a lien of the person that obtained appointment of the receiver, any subordinate lien, and any right of redemption but is subject to a senior lien.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A lien on receivership property that is extinguished by a transfer under subsection (3) attaches to the proceeds of the transfer with the same validity, perfection, and priority the lien had on the property immediately before the transfer, even if the proceeds are not sufficient to satisfy all obligations secured by the lien.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A transfer under subsection (3) may occur by means other than a public auction sale. A creditor holding a valid lien on the property to be transferred may purchase the property and offset against the purchase price part or all of the allowed amount secured by the lien, if the creditor tenders funds sufficient to satisfy in full the reasonable expenses of transfer and the obligation secured by any senior lien extinguished by the transfer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A reversal or modification of an order approving a transfer under subsection (3) does not affect the validity of the transfer to a person that acquired the property in good faith or revive against the person any lien extinguished by the transfer, whether the person knew before the transfer of the request for reversal or modification, unless the court stayed the order before the transfer.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>554.1027 "Timeshare interest" defined; executory contract.</B><P>Sec. 17.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As used in this section, "timeshare interest" means either of the following, as applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Unless subdivision (b) applies, an interest having a duration of more than 3 years that grants its holder the right to use and occupy an accommodation, facility, or recreational site, whether improved or not, for a specific period less than a full year during any given year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the condominium act, 1978 PA 59, MCL 559.101 to 559.276, applies, a time-share estate or a time-share license, as those terms are defined in section 10 of the condominium act, 1978 PA 59, MCL 559.110.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (8), with court approval, a receiver may adopt or reject an executory contract of the owner relating to receivership property. The court may condition the receiver's adoption and continued performance of the contract on terms appropriate under the circumstances. If the receiver does not request court approval to adopt or reject the contract within a reasonable time after the receiver's appointment, the receiver is deemed to have rejected the contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A receiver's performance of an executory contract before court approval under subsection (2) of its adoption or rejection is not an adoption of the contract and does not preclude the receiver from seeking approval to reject the contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A provision in an executory contract that requires or permits a forfeiture, modification, or termination of the contract because of the appointment of a receiver or the financial condition of the owner does not affect a receiver's power under subsection (2) to adopt the contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A receiver's right to possess or use receivership property pursuant to an executory contract terminates on rejection of the contract under subsection (2). Rejection is a breach of the contract effective immediately before appointment of the receiver. A claim for damages for rejection of the contract must be submitted by the later of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The time set for submitting a claim in the receivership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Thirty days after the court approves the rejection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If, at the time a receiver is appointed, the owner has the right to assign an executory contract relating to receivership property under law of this state other than this act, the receiver may assign the contract with court approval.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a receiver rejects under subsection (2) an executory contract for the sale of receivership property that is real property in possession of the purchaser or a real-property timeshare interest, the purchaser may do either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Treat the rejection as a termination of the contract, and in that case the purchaser has a lien on the property for the recovery of any part of the purchase price the purchaser paid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Retain the purchaser's right to possession under the contract, and in that case the purchaser shall continue to perform all obligations arising under the contract and may offset any damages caused by nonperformance of an obligation of the owner after the date of the rejection, but the purchaser has no right or claim against other receivership property or the receiver on account of the damages.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A receiver may not reject an unexpired lease of real property under which the owner is the landlord if 1 or more of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The tenant occupies the leased premises as the tenant's primary residence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The receiver was appointed at the request of a person other than a mortgagee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The receiver was appointed at the request of a mortgagee and 1 or more of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The lease is superior to the lien of the mortgage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The tenant has an enforceable agreement with the mortgagee or the holder of a senior lien under which the tenant's occupancy will not be disturbed as long as the tenant performs its obligations under the lease.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The mortgagee has consented to the lease, either in a signed record or by its failure timely to object that the lease violated the mortgage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The terms of the lease were commercially reasonable at the time the lease was agreed to and the tenant did not know or have reason to know that the lease violated the mortgage.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Within 7 days after the receipt by the receiver of the list required under section 13(1)(d), the receiver shall provide all creditors and any other known interested parties with notice and a copy of any order governing its appointment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the court may delay, limit, or eliminate the notice required by this subsection on finding that cause exists for doing so.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the receiver concludes that receivership property is likely to be sufficient to provide a distribution to creditors other than those holding a perfected lien on the property, the court shall order that the receiver give notice to all creditors and any other known interested parties that they need to submit claims under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) When notice is given under subsection (1) or (2), it must be given by both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Deposit for delivery through first-class mail or other commercially reasonable delivery method to the last known address of each creditor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Publication as directed by the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as otherwise directed by the court, the notice required by subsection (1) must specify the date by which each creditor holding a claim against the owner that arose before appointment of the receiver must submit the claim to the receiver. The date specified must be at least 90 days after the later of notice under subsection (3)(a) or last publication under subsection (3)(b). The court may extend the period for submitting the claim. Unless the court orders otherwise, a claim that is not submitted timely is not entitled to a distribution from the receivership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A claim submitted by a creditor under this section must satisfy all of the following requirements:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The claim must state the name and address of the creditor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The claim must state the amount and basis of the claim.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The claim must include a copy of any record on which the claim is based.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An assignment by a creditor of a claim against the owner is effective against the receiver only if the assignee gives timely notice of the assignment to the receiver in a signed record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) At any time before entry of an order approving a receiver's final report, the receiver may file with the court an objection to a claim of a creditor, stating the basis for the objection. The court shall allow or disallow the claim according to law of this state other than this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Subject to section 21, both of the following apply to a distribution of receivership property:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the distribution is to a creditor holding a perfected lien on the property, the distribution must be made in accordance with the creditor's priority under law of this state other than this act.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>554.1054 Assignment of rents; enforceable security interest; discharge; foreclosure; applicability.</B><P>Sec. 4.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An assignment of rents is created by an assignment in either an enforceable security instrument that grants a security interest in rents or a document that grants a security interest in rents which is signed in connection with an enforceable security instrument as to any real property described in the document creating the assignment of rents.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as provided in subsection (5), an assignment of rents creates a presently effective security interest in all accrued and unaccrued rents arising from the real property described in the document creating the assignment, regardless of whether the document is in the form of an absolute assignment, an absolute assignment conditioned upon default, an assignment as additional security, or any other form. The security interest in rents is separate and distinct from any security interest held by the assignee in the real property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A discharge of a security instrument discharges by operation of law any assignment of rents made in connection with the discharged security instrument.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Upon a foreclosure of the security instrument, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The assignment of rents made in connection with the security instrument continues to be effective to the extent of the remaining secured obligation and transfers to the purchaser at the foreclosure sale by operation of law whether or not the foreclosure notice makes reference to the assignment of rents. Any transfer of the foreclosure deed by the holder of the deed also transfers the assignment of rents to the transferee by operation of law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The assignment of rents made in connection with the security instrument automatically terminates upon the earlier of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Redemption from the foreclosure sale.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Expiration of the redemption period without redemption. For purposes of this subparagraph, the assignment of rents in connection with any subordinate security instrument automatically terminates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) This act does not apply to an assignment of rents regarding an interest in real property improved by 1 to 4 dwelling units unless 1 or more of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The interest is used for agricultural, commercial, industrial, or mineral-extraction purposes, other than incidental uses by an assignor occupying the property as the assignor's primary residence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The interest secures an obligation incurred at a time when the property was used or planned for use for agricultural, commercial, industrial, or mineral-extraction purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The assignor planned or is planning to develop the property into 1 or more dwelling units to be sold or leased in the ordinary course of the owner's business.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The assignor is collecting or has the right to collect rents or other income from the property from a person other than an affiliate of the assignor.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A document creating an assignment of rents may be submitted for recording to the register of deeds in the same manner as any other document evidencing a conveyance of an interest in real property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Upon recording, the security interest in rents created by an assignment of rents is fully perfected, even if a provision of the document creating the assignment or law of this state other than this act would preclude or defer enforcement of the security interest until the occurrence of a subsequent event, including a subsequent default of the assignor, the assignee's obtaining possession of the real property, or the appointment of a receiver.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4), a perfected security interest in rents takes priority over the rights of a person that, after the security interest is perfected, does either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Acquires a judicial lien against the rents or the real property from which the rents arise. If the judicial lien arises out of a construction lien, the priority of the security interests in the rents must be determined under the construction lien act, 1980 PA 497, MCL 570.1101 to 570.1305.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Purchases an interest in the rents or the real property from which the rents arise.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A perfected security interest in rents has priority over the rights of a person described in subsection (3) with respect to future advances to the same extent as the assignee's security interest in the real property has priority over the rights of that person with respect to future advances.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Rents that accrue on or after that date, as those rents accrue.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The assignor is in default and any of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The assignor has agreed in a signed document to the appointment of a receiver in the event of the assignor's default.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) It appears likely that the real property and any other collateral granted by the assignor to the assignee may not be sufficient to satisfy the secured obligation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The assignor has failed to turn over to the assignee proceeds that the assignee was entitled to collect under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) A subordinate assignee of rents obtains the appointment of a receiver for the real property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Other circumstances exist that would justify the appointment of a receiver under law of this state other than this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An assignee may file a petition for the appointment of a receiver if any of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The petition is filed in connection with an action to foreclose the security instrument.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The petition is filed in connection with an action for specific performance of the assignment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The petition is filed in connection with an action seeking a remedy on account of waste or threatened waste of the real property subject to the assignment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The petition is filed in connection with an action to otherwise enforce the secured obligation or the assignee's remedies arising from the assignment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Other circumstances exist that would justify the appointment of a receiver under law of this state other than this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An assignee that files a petition for the appointment of a receiver shall also give a copy of the petition in the manner specified in section 3 to any other person that, 10 days before the date the petition is filed, held a recorded assignment of rents arising from the real property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If an assignee enforces an assignment of rents by seeking the appointment of a receiver, the date of enforcement is the date on which the assignee files a petition to appoint a receiver as to the assignment of rents if the court enters an order appointing a receiver for the real property subject to the assignment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) From the date of its appointment, a receiver is entitled to collect rents as provided in section 6(2). The receiver also has the authority provided in the order of appointment and law of this state other than this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The following rules govern priority among receivers:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If more than 1 assignee qualify under this section for the appointment of a receiver, a receivership requested by an assignee entitled to priority in rents under this act has priority over a receivership requested by a subordinate assignee, even if a court has previously appointed a receiver for the subordinate assignee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If a subordinate assignee obtains the appointment of a receiver, the receiver may collect the rents and apply the proceeds in the manner specified in the order appointing the receiver until a receiver is appointed under a senior assignment of rents.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Upon the assignor's default, or as otherwise agreed by the assignor, the assignee may give the assignor a notice demanding that the assignor pay over the proceeds of any rents that the assignee is entitled to collect under section 6. The assignee shall record the notice in the office of the register of deeds in the same manner as the security instrument is recorded. The filing of a petition for appointment of a receiver, if it is served in the manner provided in section 3 within 10 days after it is filed, constitutes a recorded notification demanding that the assignor pay over the proceeds of any rents that the assignee is entitled to collect under section 6. The assignee shall also give a copy of the recorded or filed notification to any other person that, 10 days before the notification date, held a recorded assignment of rents arising from the real property.</div>

The assignee shall give a copy of the notification to the assignor and to any other person that, 10 days before the notification date, held a recorded assignment of rents arising from the real property. The notification must be signed by the assignee and do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Identify the tenant, assignor, assignee, premises covered by the agreement between the tenant and the assignor, and assignment of rents being enforced.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Provide the recording data for the document creating the assignment or other reasonable proof that the assignment was made.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Have attached a copy of the recorded or filed notification to the assignor as provided in section 8.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Subject to subsection (4) and any other claim or defense that a tenant has under an agreement enforceable against the assignee or under the law of the United States or this state other than this act, following receipt of a notification substantially complying with subsection (1), all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A tenant is obligated to pay to the assignee all unpaid accrued rents and all unaccrued rents as they accrue, unless the tenant has previously received a notification from another assignee of rents given by that assignee in accordance with this section and the other assignee has not canceled that notification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Unless a tenant occupies the premises as the tenant's primary residence, a tenant that pays rents to the assignor is not discharged from the obligation to pay rents to the assignee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A tenant's payment to the assignee of rents then due satisfies the tenant's obligation under the tenant's rental agreement to the extent of the payment made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A tenant's obligation to pay rents to the assignee continues until the tenant receives a court order directing the tenant to pay the rent in a different manner or a signed document from the assignee canceling its notification, whichever occurs first.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>You may obtain additional information about the Assignment of Rents and the Assignee's right to enforce it at the address listed above.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>2. The Landlord is in default under the Assignment of Rents. Under the Assignment of Rents, the Assignee is entitled to collect rents from the Premises.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>3. This notification affects your rights and obligations under the rental agreement under which you occupy the Premises (your "Rental Agreement"). In order to provide you with an opportunity to consult with a lawyer, if your next scheduled rental payment is due within 30 days after you receive this notification, neither the Assignee nor the Landlord can hold you in default under your Rental Agreement for nonpayment of that rental payment until 10 days after the due date of that payment or 30 days following the date you receive this notification, whichever occurs first. You may consult a lawyer at your expense concerning your rights and obligations under your Rental Agreement and the effect of this notification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>4. You must pay to the Assignee at the address listed above all rents under your Rental Agreement which are due and payable on the date you receive this notification and all rents accruing under your Rental Agreement after you receive this notification. If you pay rents to the Assignee after receiving this notification, the payment will satisfy your rental obligation to the extent of that payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>5. Unless you occupy the premises as your primary residence, if you pay any rents to the Landlord after receiving this notification, your payment to the Landlord will not discharge your rental obligation, and the Assignee may hold you liable for that rental obligation notwithstanding your payment to the Landlord.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>6. Any modification of the Rental Agreement is not binding on the Assignee without the Assignee's written consent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>7. If you have previously received a notification from another person that also holds an assignment of the rents due under your Rental Agreement, you should continue paying your rents to the person that sent that notification until that person cancels that notification. Once that notification is canceled, you must begin paying rents to the Assignee in accordance with this notification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>8. Your obligation to pay rents to the Assignee will continue until you receive either:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) a written order from a court directing you to pay the rent in a manner specified in that order; or</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) written instructions from the Assignee canceling this notification.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Unless otherwise agreed by the assignee, and subject to subsection (3), an assignee that collects rents following enforcement under section 8 or 9 need not apply them to the payment of expenses of protecting or maintaining the real property subject to the assignment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Unless a tenant has made an enforceable agreement not to assert claims or defenses, the right of the assignee to collect rents from the tenant is subject to the terms of the agreement between the assignor and tenant and any claim or defense arising from the assignor's nonperformance of that agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) This act does not limit the standing or right of a tenant, assignor, or other affected person to request a court to appoint a receiver for the real property subject to the assignment or to seek other relief on the ground that the assignee's nonpayment of expenses of protecting or maintaining the real property has caused or threatened harm to the tenant's, assignor's, or other affected person's interest in the property.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) In this section, "good faith" means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If an assignor collects rents that the assignee is entitled to collect under this act, both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The assignor shall turn over the proceeds to the assignee, less any amount representing payment of expenses authorized by the assignee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The assignee continues to have a security interest in the proceeds so long as they are identifiable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For purposes of this act, cash proceeds are identifiable if they are maintained in a segregated account or, if commingled with other funds, to the extent the assignee can identify them by a method of tracing, including application of equitable principles, that is permitted under law of this state other than this act with respect to commingled funds.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In addition to any other remedy available to the assignee under law of this state other than this act, if an assignor fails to turn over proceeds to the assignee as required by subsection (2), the assignee may recover from the assignor or a person liable under the uniform voidable transactions act, 1998 PA 434, MCL 566.31 to 566.45, or both, in a civil action, both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The proceeds, or an amount equal to the proceeds, that the assignor was obligated to turn over under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred by the assignee to the extent provided for by agreement and not prohibited by law of this state other than this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The assignee may maintain an action under subsection (4) without bringing an action to foreclose any security interest that it may have in the real property, and an action under subsection (4) does not bar a foreclosure by advertisement under chapter 32 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.3201 to 600.3285. Any sums recovered in the action must be applied in the manner specified in section 12.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Unless otherwise agreed, if an assignee entitled to priority under section 5(3) enforces its interest in rents after another creditor holding a subordinate security interest in rents has enforced its interest under section 8 or 9, the creditor holding the subordinate security interest in rents is not obligated to turn over any proceeds that it collects in good faith before the creditor receives notification that the senior assignee has enforced its interest in rents. The creditor shall turn over to the senior assignee any proceeds that it collects after it receives the notification.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Article 9" means article 9 of the uniform commercial code, 1962 PA 174, MCL 440.9101 to 440.9809, or, to the extent applicable to any particular issue, article 9 of the uniform commercial code as adopted by the state whose laws govern that issue under the choice-of-laws rules contained in article 9 as adopted by this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Conflicting interest" means an interest in proceeds, held by a person other than an assignee, that is either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A security interest arising under article 9.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Any other interest if article 9 resolves the priority conflict between that person and a secured party with a conflicting security interest in the proceeds.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An assignee's security interest in identifiable cash proceeds is perfected if its security interest in rents is perfected. An assignee's security interest in identifiable noncash proceeds is perfected only if the assignee perfects that interest in accordance with article 9.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4), priority between an assignee's security interest in identifiable proceeds and a conflicting interest is governed by the priority rules in article 9.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An assignee's perfected security interest in identifiable cash proceeds is subordinate to a conflicting interest that is perfected by control under article 9 but has priority over a conflicting interest that is perfected other than by control.</div>
