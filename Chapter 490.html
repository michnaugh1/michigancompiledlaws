<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   As used in this act:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   “Account” means a contract of deposit of funds between depositors and credit unions, and includes deposit accounts, members or share accounts and other like arrangements whether or not they may be characterized as refundable capital investments.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   “Beneficiary” means any person named a beneficial owner when an account provides that it is payable to a trustee for the beneficial owner.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   “Demand” means a request for withdrawal or for payment according to an order therefor in compliance with all conditions of the account and bylaws of the credit union.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   “Multiple-party account” means an account in the names of 2 or more persons, 1 or more or all of whom may make withdrawals, or an account in the name of 1 or more parties as trustee for 1 or more beneficiaries even though no mention is made of a right of withdrawal by a beneficiary. Accounts established for deposit of funds of a partnership, joint venture or other association or accounts controlled by 2 or more persons as the duly authorized agents or trustees for a corporation, unincorporated association, charitable or civic organization or any trust, except trusts of deposits evidenced only by the form of the deposit, are excluded from the meaning of the term and from the provisions of this act. At least 1 party to a multiple-party account shall be a member of the credit union in which the account is established.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   “Net contribution” of a party to a multiple-party account as of any given time is the sum of all deposits made by or for him, less all withdrawals made by or for him which have not been paid to or applied to the use of any other party, plus a pro rata share of any interest or dividends included in the current balance. It includes, in addition, any deposit life insurance proceeds added to the account by reason of the death of the party whose net contribution is in question.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   “Party” means a person who, alone or in conjunction with another, by the terms of the account or as a surviving beneficiary of a trust account, has a present right of withdrawal in a multiple-party account. Unless the context indicates otherwise, it includes a guardian, conservator-trustee, personal representative, or assignee, including an attaching creditor, of a party. It also includes a person identified as a trustee of an account for another whether or not a beneficiary is named, but it does not include any named beneficiary, unless he has a present right of withdrawal.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   “Payment” of sums on deposit includes withdrawal and payment on directive of a party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   “Person” includes any person or entity capable of contracting.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   “Proof of death” includes a death certificate or other statement issued by an appropriate official which indicates that a named person is dead.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)   “Sums on deposit” means the balance payable on a multiple-party account including interest, dividends, and in addition any deposit life insurance proceeds added to the account by reason of the death of a party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(k)   “Withdrawal” includes payment to a third person pursuant to directive of a party.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The death of any party to a multiple-party account shall have no effect on the beneficial ownership of the account, other than to transfer the decedent's right to his estate, unless the account is a survivorship account or trust account, as provided in sections 6 and 7.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 6.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A multiple-party account payable to 2 or more persons, jointly or severally, which does not expressly provide that there is no right of survivorship, though there is no mention of survivorship or joint tenancy, is presumed to be a survivorship account. At the death of a party, sums on deposit in a survivorship account belong to the surviving party or parties as against the estate of the decedent. Where there are 2 or more survivors, their respective ownerships shall be in proportion to their previous net contributions augmented by an equal share for each survivor of any interest the decedent may have owned in the account immediately before his death, plus the proceeds of insurance on decedent's life paid to the account. The right of survivorship continues between survivors.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 7.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   An account which states that a party is a trustee for 1 or more other identified persons, including but not limited to minors, is a trust account. Except where there is evidence of a trust other than as provided by the form of the account, the account and any sums withdrawn therefrom are presumed to belong beneficially to the trustee until his death. At the death of the trustee or surviving trustee any sums remaining on deposit are presumed to belong to the person or persons named as beneficiaries, if living, or to the survivor of them if 1 or more have died before the trustee. The death thereafter of any beneficiary has no effect on the equal ownership of all who survived the trustee, as no right of survivorship is presumed to attend the relationship of several beneficiaries who survive a trustee. If no beneficiary survives the trustee, the sums are presumed to belong to the estate of the last trustee to die. If 2 or more parties are named as trustees on the account, and there is no evidence of trust except as provided by the form of the account, the account is presumed to be a survivorship account as between trustees. It is presumed to be owned between trustees as provided by this act.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The presumptions stated herein are based upon inferences of the intention of parties to multiple-party accounts arising from the form of the account and the usual expectations of people using these accounts. The presumptions are rebuttable by clear and convincing evidence of a different intention. The presumptions of survivorship are not subject to change by will but may be rebutted by a written order received by the credit union to change the form of account or directing that payment not be made in accordance with the account which is signed by a party and is received by the credit union during the party's lifetime.</DIV>

No credit union shall be required to inquire as to the source of funds received for deposit to a multiple-party account or to inquire as to the proposed application of any sum withdrawn from an account. Such an account may be created with any person designated by the credit union member, but no joint tenant shall be permitted to vote, obtain loans or hold office unless he is within the field of membership and is a qualified member.</DIV>

The protection here given does not extend to payments made after a credit union has received written notice from any party who has a present right of withdrawal to the effect that withdrawals in accordance with the terms of the account should not be permitted. Unless the notice is withdrawn by the person giving it, the death of any party after notice has no effect on withdrawal rights, and the personal representative, or heirs, of the decedent must concur in any demand for withdrawal if the credit union is to be protected under this section. No other notice or any other information shown to have been available to a credit union shall affect its right to the protection provided here. The protection here provided shall have no bearing on the rights of parties in disputes between themselves or their successors concerning the beneficial ownership of funds in, or withdrawn from, multiple-party accounts.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the commissioner determines that a violation or threatened violation or an unsafe or unsound practice or practices specified in the notice of charges served upon a domestic credit union under section 210, or the continuation of the violation or practice, is likely to cause insolvency or substantial dissipation of assets or earnings of the domestic credit union, or is likely to otherwise seriously prejudice the interests of its depositors, the commissioner may issue a temporary order requiring the domestic credit union to cease and desist from that violation or practice. The temporary order is effective upon service upon the domestic credit union and is effective and enforceable until a cease and desist order under section 210 is issued and becomes effective or until it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the commissioner or a reviewing court in a proceeding under subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Within 10 days after a domestic credit union has been served with a temporary cease and desist order under subsection (1), the domestic credit union may apply to the circuit court for the county in which the principal office of the domestic credit union is located for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of the order pending the completion of the proceedings under section 210.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If in the opinion of the commissioner a director,  officer, or employee of a domestic credit union, or any other person who participates in the conduct of the affairs of the domestic credit union, has committed any violation of law or rule or of a cease and desist order or other order of the commissioner that has become final, or has engaged or participated in any unsafe or unsound practice in connection with the domestic credit union, or has committed or engaged in any act, omission, or practice that constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty  of that person, and the commissioner determines that the domestic credit union has suffered or will probably suffer substantial financial loss or other damage or that the interests of its members and depositors could be seriously prejudiced by reason of the violation or practice or breach of fiduciary duty, the commissioner may serve upon the  person a written notice of intention to remove  that person from office.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If in the opinion of the commissioner a director, officer, or  employee of a domestic credit union, or another person who participates or has participated in the conduct of the affairs of  the domestic credit union,  has engaged in conduct or practice with respect to the domestic credit union or another business organization that resulted in substantial financial loss or other damage, or is otherwise unfit to participate in the conduct of the affairs of the domestic credit union, the commissioner may serve upon that person a written notice of intention to remove the person from office or to prohibit the person's further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of  any domestic credit union.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the commissioner considers it necessary for the protection of a domestic credit union or the interests of its shareholders or depositors that a person served with a notice of intention under subsection (1) or (2) is suspended from office or prohibited from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the domestic credit union, the commissioner may serve upon that person a written notice suspending him or her from office or prohibiting him or her from further participation in any manner in the conduct of affairs of the domestic credit union. A suspension or prohibition is effective upon service of the notice and unless stayed by a court in a proceeding under section 213 remains in effect until the administrative proceedings against the person are completed and the commissioner dismisses the charges specified in the notice, or until the effective date of the order if an order of suspension or prohibition is issued.

Except as otherwise approved by the commissioner, the hearing shall be held not earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after the date of service of the notice. The failure of a person to appear at the hearing in person or by a duly authorized representative is consent to the issuance of an order of removal or prohibition. If the person consents, or if after the hearing the commissioner finds that any grounds specified in the notice have been established, the commissioner may issue an order of suspension or removal from office, or prohibition from participation in the conduct of the affairs of the domestic credit union, as appropriate. An order based on the finding of the commissioner is effective on the thirty-first day after service on the domestic credit union and the person concerned. An order by consent is effective at the time specified in the order. An order is effective and enforceable unless it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by the commissioner or a reviewing court.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The membership of a domestic credit union is comprised of each person that organized the domestic credit union, and each person that meets all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The person belongs to a group of persons that is within the domestic credit union's field of membership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The person is accepted by the domestic credit union as a member.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The person pays any entrance or membership fee required by the domestic credit union.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The person pays for 1 or more shares, including a membership share if the domestic credit union requires ownership of a membership share.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The person complies with any other requirement for membership contained in the domestic credit union's bylaws.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The credit union board of a domestic credit union shall establish the field of membership for a domestic credit union. The field of membership shall consist of 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) One or more groups of any size that have a common bond of occupation, association, or religious affiliation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) One or more groups composed of persons whose common bond is residence, employment, or place of religious worship within a geographic area composed of 1 or more school districts, counties, cities, villages, or townships.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) One or more groups whose common bond is common interests, activities, or objectives.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) One or more credit unions may serve 1 or more groups described in subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A credit union board that establishes or revises the field of membership of the domestic credit union shall submit the proposed or revised field of membership to the commissioner for approval on an application form provided by the commissioner. The commissioner shall promptly notify an applicant when he or she determines that an application is complete and the date of that determination. If the application seeks to revise a field of membership to include 1 or more groups described in subsection (2)(b), the commissioner may require that the applicant provide additional information regarding the common bond of persons within the proposed geographical area or areas. The commissioner  shall establish standards for obtaining this additional information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The commissioner has 60 days after the date of determination described in subsection (4) to approve or disapprove of an application under subsection (4). In reviewing an application under subsection (4), the commissioner must first determine whether the proposed field of membership meets the common bond requirements of subsection (2). If the commissioner determines that the proposed field of membership does meet the common bond requirements of subsection (2), then the commissioner may only disapprove of the application on the basis of safety and soundness of the domestic credit union. If the commissioner does not approve or disapprove of the application, or extend the 60-day period under subsection (6), within that 60-day period, the application is considered approved as of the day after the 60-day period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The commissioner may extend the 60-day period described in subsection (5) for 1 or more additional 60-day periods for administrative reasons or to allow for public comment if the commissioner delivers notice of each 60-day extension in writing to the domestic credit union before the 60-day period and any prior 60-day extensions expire. An extension notice shall explain the reason for the extension. If the commissioner does not approve or disapprove of the application, or grant an additional 60-day extension, within a 60-day extension period, the application is considered approved as of the day after the 60-day extension period. The commissioner may grant any number of 60-day extensions, but the domestic credit union may treat any extension after the third 60-day extension as a disapproval of the application and may pursue any administrative or legal remedies available for a disapproval.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If authorized in the bylaws of the domestic credit union, a member that is no longer in the field of membership of the domestic credit union because the field of membership is revised under this section, or the member leaves the field of membership, may continue as a member, on the same basis as any other member, or on a different basis if the bylaws establish a different basis for that continued membership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A domestic credit union shall respond to an application for membership within 30 calendar days after receiving it. If the domestic credit union determines that there is a sound business reason for the action, a domestic credit union may deny membership to any applicant for membership.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The capital of a domestic credit union consists of the payments that have been made to it by the members for shares. If authorized by the bylaws, a domestic credit union may charge an entrance fee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If at any time after the effective date of this act a federal credit union is authorized by the federal regulatory authority with jurisdiction and by federal law to utilize 1 or more forms of secondary capital other than capital stock, the commissioner may by rule, order, or declaratory ruling allow a domestic credit union to utilize 1 or more forms of secondary capital other than capital stock.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   At least 30 days before voting on a plan of conversion under subdivision (b), the credit union board gives written notice to the credit union's members that it is considering a conversion. The credit union board shall mail the notice to the credit union's members and shall not include any other mailing with the notice. The notice shall include all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   A brief statement of why the credit union board is considering the conversion.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   A brief statement of the major positive and negative effects of the proposed conversion.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   A request for members' written comments on the proposed conversion.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The credit union board approves of a plan of conversion and files the plan of conversion with the commissioner. An affirmative vote of 2/3 of the entire credit union board is required to approve a plan of conversion. The plan of conversion shall meet all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The conversion plan discloses to the members information concerning the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed conversion and contains a statement indicating any material differences in powers of the converted credit union.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   The conversion is not intended to circumvent a pending supervisory action initiated by the commissioner or another regulatory agency because of a concern over the safety and soundness of the credit union.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   The converted credit union is likely to be economically viable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The members of the credit union approve of the plan of conversion by a 2/3 vote of the members voting on the plan. Subject to subsection (2), a member may vote at a special meeting called to vote on the plan of conversion or by mail ballot. Before the vote, the credit union board shall call a special meeting of the members to provide information on the plan. At least 14 days before the meeting, the credit union board shall mail to each member a notice of the meeting and a ballot with a postage paid return envelope. The notice shall state the date, at least 15 days following the meeting, by which the member must return the ballot and the methods permitted for casting a vote, describe briefly the reasons for and the major positive and negative effects of the conversion, and state how members may obtain copies of the conversion plan. The credit union board shall count the votes cast by members upon the expiration of the time given to the members to return their ballots.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The credit union files with the commissioner copies of member comments submitted to the credit union under subdivision (a)(iii) and certified copies of records of all proceedings held by the credit union board and members of the credit union.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   If required by the laws of the applicable jurisdiction, the credit union files with the commissioner a certified copy of the consent or approval of the appropriate regulatory authority with jurisdiction over foreign credit unions chartered by that authority.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the commissioner approves of the method before the vote, the credit union board may establish an alternative method for accepting votes from members of a converting domestic credit union on the plan of conversion under subsection (1)(c) if the alternative method is reasonably calculated to ensure each member has an opportunity to vote.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If all of the conditions required by this section are met and the commissioner determines that any notices to members were accurate, timely, and not misleading, and that conduct of the vote on the conversion plan was fair and lawful, the commissioner shall approve the conversion and the conversion is effective.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as provided in subsection (2), if a conversion becomes effective under section 372, 373, or 374, the converted entity is a continuation of the converting credit union and all the property and interests in property and every cause of action, right, privilege, interest, and asset of the converting credit union is immediately and without any conveyance, transfer, or other action vested in the converted organization. Every right, obligation, and relationship of the converting credit union to or in respect to any person, estate, creditor, member, depositor, trust, trustee, collective bargaining agreement, or beneficiary of any trust or fiduciary function continue unimpaired. The converted organization shall continue to hold all the rights, obligations, relationships, and trusts, and the duties and liabilities connected with them, and shall execute and perform each and every trust and relationship in the same manner as if the credit union had not converted. The conversion does not release the converted organization from its obligations to pay and discharge all the liabilities created by law or incurred by the converting credit union before the conversion, or any tax imposed by the laws of this state up to the day of the conversion in proportion to the time that has elapsed since the last preceding tax payment, or any assessment, penalty, or forfeiture imposed or incurred under the laws of this state before the date of the conversion.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Within 1 year after the conversion, the commissioner may for good cause require a converting credit union to divest itself of an asset that does not conform to the legal requirements relative to assets acquired and held by the converted organization.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a converting credit union was appointed in a fiduciary capacity by a court or governmental tribunal, agency, or officer, the converted organization shall file an affidavit with the appointing authority setting forth the fact of conversion, the name and address of the converted organization, and the amount of its capital and surplus. A converted organization acting as a fiduciary by appointment of a court is subject to removal by a court of competent jurisdiction.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 376.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A foreign credit union may convert to a domestic credit union if all of the following are met:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The foreign credit union complies with the applicable law under which it is chartered for a conversion under that law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The credit union board files a certificate of organization with the commissioner, approved and executed in triplicate by a majority of the credit union board.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   After an examination of the credit union and the proceedings of the directors and members concerning the conversion, the commissioner approves of the certificate of organization filed under subdivision (b).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   If the commissioner approves the certificate of organization, the commissioner shall notify the applicants of the commissioner's decision and shall immediately issue a certificate of approval attached to the duplicate certificate of organization and return it to the credit union. The certificate shall indicate that the conversion complies with the laws of this state and that after conversion the credit union and all its members, officers, and employees have the same rights, powers, and privileges and are subject to the same duties, liabilities, and obligations that apply to domestic credit unions under this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The credit union shall pay the expenses of the examination described in subsection (1)(d), in an amount established by the commissioner. The amount paid for the examination is not refundable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the commissioner approves a conversion, the credit union shall pay an operating fee determined under section 201, on a prorated basis for the operating fee period in which the conversion becomes effective. The date that the conversion becomes effective is the basis for calculating the proration.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a conversion becomes effective under this section, the converted domestic credit union is a continuation of the converting foreign credit union and all the property and interests in property and every cause of action, right, privilege, interest, and asset of the converting foreign credit union is immediately and without any conveyance, transfer, or other action vested in the converted domestic credit union. Every right, obligation, and relationship of the converting foreign credit union to or in respect to any person, estate, creditor, member, depositor, trust, trustee, collective bargaining agreement, or beneficiary of any trust or fiduciary function continue unimpaired. The converted domestic credit union shall continue to hold all the rights, obligations, relationships, and trusts, and the duties and liabilities connected with them, and shall execute and perform each and every trust and relationship in the same manner as if it had after the conversion assumed the trust or relationship and obligations and liabilities connected with the trust or relationship.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Any directors of the foreign credit union converting to a domestic credit union under this section that meet the criteria described in section 341(8) may continue as directors of the domestic credit union.</DIV>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>490.383 Discharge of duties by officers; standards; indemnification.</B><P>
</P>
<P>Sec. 383.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An official of a domestic credit union shall discharge the duties of his or her position in good faith and with that degree of diligence, care, and skill that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances in a like position. In discharging his or her duties, an official may rely upon the opinion of legal counsel for the domestic credit union, upon the report of an independent appraiser selected with reasonable care by the board or by an officer of the domestic credit union, or upon financial statements of the domestic credit union represented to him or her to be correct by the general manager or the officer of the domestic credit union having charge of its records, or as stated in a written report by an independent public or certified public accountant or firm of accountants fairly to reflect the financial condition of the domestic credit union.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A domestic credit union may indemnify a person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to a threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative and whether formal or informal, other than an action by or on behalf of the domestic credit union, because he or she is or was an official, employee, or agent of the domestic credit union or is or was serving at the request of the domestic credit union as an official, employee, or agent of 1 or more domestic credit unions or other profit or nonprofit enterprises, for attorney fees, judgments, penalties, fines, amounts paid in settlement, and other expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the action, suit, or proceeding. A domestic credit union may only indemnify a person under this subsection if the person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the domestic credit union or its members, and with respect to a criminal action or proceeding, if the person had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not of itself create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner that he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the domestic credit union or its members and with respect to a criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A domestic credit union may indemnify a person who was or is a party to or is threatened to be made a party to a threatened, pending, or completed action or suit, by or on behalf of the domestic credit union to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was an official, employee, or agent of the domestic credit union or is or was serving at the request of the domestic credit union as an official, employee, or agent of 1 or more domestic credit unions or other profit or nonprofit enterprises, for actual and reasonable attorney fees, amounts paid in settlement incurred by the person in connection with the action or suit, and other expenses. A domestic credit union may only indemnify a person under this subsection if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the domestic credit union or its members and a domestic credit union shall not indemnify a person for a claim, issue, or matter in which the person has been found liable to the domestic credit union unless and only to the extent that the court in which the action or suit was brought has determined upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for the expenses that the court considers proper.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   To the extent that an official, employee, or agent of a domestic credit union is successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of an action, suit, or proceeding described in subsection (8), or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter in the action, suit, or proceeding, the domestic credit union shall indemnify the person for actual and reasonable attorney fees and other expenses incurred by him or her in connection with the action, suit, or proceeding and any action, suit, or proceeding brought to enforce the mandatory indemnification provided in this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Unless ordered by a court, a domestic credit union shall indemnify a person under subsection (2) or (3) only for the action, suit, or proceeding specified by the domestic credit union in the determination described in this subsection and only if the domestic credit union obtains from 1 of the following a determination that indemnification of the person is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsection (2) or (3):</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The credit union board, by a majority vote of a quorum of the board consisting of directors who are or were not parties to the action, suit, or proceeding.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If a quorum described in subdivision (a) is not obtainable, a committee of directors that consists of 2 or more directors who are or were not parties to the action, by majority vote.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Independent legal counsel in a written opinion.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The members.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If a person is entitled to indemnification under subsection (2) or (3) for a portion of attorney fees, judgments, penalties, fines, amounts paid in settlement, and other expenses, but not for the total amount of the expenses, the domestic credit union may indemnify the person for the portion of the attorney fees, judgments, penalties, fines, amounts paid in settlement, or other expenses for which the person is entitled to indemnification.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A domestic credit union may pay expenses incurred by a person in defending a civil or criminal action, suit, or proceeding described in subsection (2) or (3) before the final disposition of the action, suit, or proceeding if the domestic credit union receives an unlimited, general, secured, or unsecured guarantee by or on behalf of the person to repay the expenses if it is ultimately determined that the person is not entitled indemnification from the domestic credit union.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   An indemnification or advance of expenses provided under subsections (2) to (7) is not exclusive of other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses is entitled under the bylaws or an agreement. The total amount of expenses advanced or indemnified from all sources combined shall not exceed the amount of actual expenses incurred by the person seeking the indemnification or advance of expenses. An indemnification provided under subsections (2) to (7) continues after the person ceases to be an official, employee, or agent and inures to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of the person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   As used in subsections (2) to (8), “domestic credit union” includes all other credit unions that become related to a domestic credit union by a consolidation or merger and the resulting or continuing credit union. A person who is or was an official, employee, or agent of a domestic credit union that is consolidated or merged into the domestic credit union or is or was serving at the request of a credit union that is consolidated or merged into the domestic credit union as an official, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of 1 or more other credit unions, or other profit or nonprofit enterprises is in the same position under this section with respect to the resulting or continuing credit union as he or she would if he or she had served the resulting or continuing credit union in the same capacity.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 421.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a domestic credit union has a credit committee, the credit committee has general supervision of all loans to members.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A credit committee shall meet as often as the business of the domestic credit union requires. The credit committee shall consider applications for loans or review the credit decisions of the loan officers of the domestic credit union. A majority vote of the members of the committee who are present at a meeting is required to approve or disapprove of a loan to a member.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A credit committee, or the credit union board if the domestic credit union does not have a credit committee, may appoint 1 or more loan officers and delegate to them the power to approve or reject loans or lines of credit or to make credit decisions concerning loans or lines of credit, subject to any limitations or conditions established by the credit committee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A member whose loan application is disapproved by a loan officer may appeal in writing to the credit committee, or to the credit union board if the domestic credit union does not have a credit committee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A domestic credit union may establish and use an automated loan approval and rejection process but may not use the automated process for appeals of loan rejections. If a domestic credit union uses an automated process, the domestic credit union shall establish a written procedure to ensure the proper functioning of the automated process.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The credit committee shall designate a secretary of the credit committee. The secretary shall maintain records of the actions of the committee concerning its lending activities as required by the credit union board.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 422.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A loan made by a domestic credit union to another domestic credit union is not subject to any interest rate limitation contained in any law of this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In addition to any other loan authorized by law, a domestic credit union may enter into a loan agreement under this subsection with a member. All of the following apply to a loan under this subsection:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The loan may be for any amount up to $1,000.00.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The term of the loan shall be 30 days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The domestic credit union may charge a fee in addition to any interest in connection with the loan. A fee is in addition to interest authorized by law and is not part of the interest collected or agreed to be paid on loans within the meaning of a law of this state that limits the rate of interest which may be exacted in a transaction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The total interest, fees, and other costs of the loan shall not exceed 10% of the principal amount.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   A member shall not have more than 1 loan under this subsection outstanding with the credit union.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A loan by a domestic credit union to a member shall conform to any conditions contained in the bylaws.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A borrower may repay a loan from a domestic credit union in whole or in part at any time the domestic credit union is open for business or otherwise capable of receiving payment on the loan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as provided in subsection (8), a domestic credit union shall not agree to rates, terms, or conditions on any loan or line of credit that is made to or endorsed or guaranteed by an official or an immediate family member of an official that are more favorable than the rates, terms, and conditions for comparable loans or lines of credit to other credit union members. A domestic credit union shall not agree to rates, terms, and conditions on any loan or line of credit to any person that has a common ownership, investment, or other pecuniary interest in a business with an official or immediate family member of an official that are more favorable than the rates, terms, and conditions for comparable loans or lines of credit to other credit union members. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A domestic credit union shall process a loan to an official or employee in the same manner as a loan to other members, except that the applicant shall not participate in the approval process for his or her loan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A domestic credit union may provide open-end or closed-end credit arrangements for its members if the credit union board has established a policy for those credit arrangements. Unless prohibited by the agreement for the open-end credit arrangement, a domestic credit union may under an open-end credit arrangement unilaterally increase the approved limit or may increase the approved limit on the request of the member.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A domestic credit union may participate in loans to credit union members jointly with other credit unions, credit union service organizations, or other financial institutions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A domestic credit union may participate in a guaranteed loan program of the federal or state government under the terms and conditions specified in the law establishing that program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A domestic credit union may offer reduced rate loans and other extensions of credit to its employees, other than employees who are board members, supervisory committee members, credit committee members, or members of any other committee that performs significant ongoing functions relating to the ongoing operations of the domestic credit union, under a policy adopted by its credit union board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The credit union board, or the credit committee if the domestic credit union has a credit committee that does not include any credit union employees, must approve of any loan or other extension of credit to or purchase of an obligation of the general manager or chief executive officer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A domestic credit union shall not make a loan or extend a line of credit if an official or senior management employee will receive a commission, fee, or compensation other than salary if the loan or line of credit is approved. However, this subsection does not limit or prohibit arrangements that compensate employees who are not senior management employees based on the volume of loans generated by those employees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A domestic credit union shall not loan an amount that exceeds 25% of the credit union's unimpaired capital to a borrower. This subsection does not apply to a corporate credit union. All of the following apply for purposes of this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the director determines at any time that the interests of a group of more than 1 person are so interrelated that they should be considered as a unit for the purpose for which credit was extended, the total loans and extensions of credit and leases of persons of that group shall be combined and considered loans and extensions of credit and leases to 1 borrower under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A credit union does not violate this subsection solely because the indebtedness of a group described in subdivision (a) exceeds the percentage limitation described in this section at the time of a determination by the director that the indebtedness of that group shall be combined under subdivision (a). However, it is a violation of this section if the credit union described in this subdivision does not do 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Subject to subparagraph (ii), if required by the director, within a reasonable time dispose of a sufficient amount of the indebtedness of the group so that the amount of the remaining indebtedness is within the percentage limitation described in this subsection. As used in this subdivision, "reasonable time" means a period of time that the director determines is reasonable, and, if the credit union is making a reasonable effort to dispose of the excess indebtedness in a manner designed to avoid a loss of any portion of that excess indebtedness, is a period of at least 180 days.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If permitted by the director, if the credit union is well capitalized, establish a reserve in the amount that the group's indebtedness exceeds the percentage limitation described in this subsection rather than disposing of that excess amount under subparagraph (i).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) As additional security for a loan transaction with a borrower, a domestic credit union may permit a person that is not a member of the domestic credit union to act as an additional borrower, a cosigner, or a guarantor of the loan.</div>
