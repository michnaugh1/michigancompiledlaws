<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The standard grades for table stock potatoes shall be limited to U.S. extra number 1 grade, U.S. number 1 grade, U.S. commercial grade, and U.S. number 2 grade and unclassified, and shall conform in all respects and be identical with the latest standards established by the United States secretary of agriculture for the grades herein mentioned, and thus conforming shall be accepted as the legal standards for the state. A and B size or any other size designation with the U.S. number 1 grade, U.S. commercial grade and U.S. number 2 grade shall be in accordance with the U.S. standards for potatoes. Standard grades shall also include a superior grade to be defined by rules promulgated by the commissioner of agriculture under this act and which would be entitled to a seal of quality under Act No. 70 of the Public Acts of 1961, being sections 289.631 to 289.646 of the Compiled Laws of 1948. Potatoes for table use shall not be sold that do not meet the requirements of the foregoing grades unless designated as unclassified. Unclassified potatoes may be sold in consumer size packages if the packages are color coded and marked "unclassified". The word "unclassified" shall be as large as the largest lettered word on the package and in no event be less than 1 inch in height.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;4.   "Well-shaped" means that normal, typical shape for the variety in the district where grown and free from pointed, dumbbell shaped, successively elongated, and other ill-formed potatoes;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;5.   "Free from damage" means that the appearance shall not be injured to an extent readily apparent upon casual examination of the lot, and that any damage from the causes mentioned can be removed in the ordinary process of preparation for use without appreciable waste in addition to that which would occur if the potato were perfect. Loss of outer skin (epidermis) shall not be considered as an injury to the appearance;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;6.   "Diameter" means the greatest dimension at right angles to the longitudinal axis;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;7.   "Soft rot" means a soft, mushy condition of the tissues from whatever cause;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;8.   "Badly misshapen" means of such shape as to cause appreciable waste in the ordinary process of preparation for use in addition to that which would occur if the potato were perfect;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;9.   "Free from serious damage" means that any damage from the causes mentioned can be removed by the ordinary process of paring without increase in waste of more than 10 per cent, by weight, over that which would occur if the potato were perfect;</DIV>

<P>Sec. 1.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   No person, firm or corporation, by himself, his servant or his agent, or as the servant or agent of any other person, firm or corporation, shall manufacture or mix for sale, sell, offer or expose for sale, or have in his possession with intent to sell in this state, under the name of raw linseed oil or raw flaxseed oil, any substance which is not wholly the product obtained from well cleaned flaxseed or linseed, and unless the aforesaid oil also fulfills the requirements of the 1900 edition of the Pharmacopoeia of the United States, which follow:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;1.   Specific gravity 0.925 to 0.935 at 25 deg. C. (77 deg. F.). It does not congeal at temperatures above 20 deg. C. (4 deg. F.). It is soluble in about 10 parts of absolute alcohol and in all proportions in ether, chloroform, petroleum, benzine, carbon disulphide and oil of turpentine. It should not more than slightly redden blue litmus paper, previously moistened with alcohol (limit of free acid). The oil should be completely saponifiable with alcoholic potassium hydroxide T.S. and the resulting soap should be completely soluble in water without leaving an oily residue, (absence of mineral oils and rosin oils). If 2 CC. of the oil be warmed and shaken in a test tube with an equal volume of glacial acetic acid, and if to this mixture, after cooling, 1 drop of sulphuric acid be added, a greenish color should be produced. (A violet color under these circumstances indicates the presence of rosin oils). Linseed oil saponified by alcoholic potassium hydroxide T.S. should show a saponification value of from 187 to 195. If 0.15 CC. of linseed oil be dissolved in 10 CC. of chloroform in a 250 CC. flask and 25 CC. of a mixture of equal volume of alcoholic iodine T.S. and alcoholic mercuric chloride T.S. added, and if, after standing for 16 hours, protected from the light, 20 CC. potassium iodide T.S. be introduced and the mixture diluted with 50 CC. of water, on titrating the excess of iodine with tenth normal sodium thiosulphate V.S. an iodine value of not less than 170 should be obtained. No person, firm or corporation, by himself, his servant or his agent, or as the servant or agent of any other person, firm or corporation, shall manufacture or mix for sale, sell, offer or expose for sale or have in his possession with intent to sell in this state, any substance as boiled linseed oil or as boiled flaxseed oil, unless the same shall have been prepared by heating raw linseed oil, as defined above: Provided, That if drier is used in said boiled linseed oil or boiled flaxseed oil, the same shall have been prepared by incorporating said drier with raw linseed oil, as defined above, at a temperature of not less than 225 deg. Fahrenheit, and furthermore contains not less than 96 per cent of linseed oil; and for the purpose of this act it shall also be deemed a violation thereof if said boiled linseed oil prepared either with or without drier does not conform to the following requirements: 1. Its specific gravity at 60 deg. Fahrenheit must be not less than 0.935 and not greater than 0.945; 2. Its saponification value (Koettstorfer figure) must not be less than 186; 3. Its iodine number (Huebl's method) must be not less than 160; 4. Its acid value must not exceed 10; 5. The volatile matter expelled at 212 deg. Fahrenheit must not exceed 1/2 of 1 per cent; 6. No mineral oil shall be present and the amount of unsaponifiable matter as determined by standard methods shall not exceed 2.5 per cent; 7. The film left after flowing the oil over glass and allowing it to drain in a vertical or nearly vertical position must dry free from tackiness in not to exceed 20 hours, at a temperature of about 70 deg. Fahrenheit. Linseed oil or flaxseed oil which does not conform to the foregoing requirements shall be deemed to be adulterated within the meaning of this act.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 9.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The bond or irrevocable letter of credit described in section 8 shall provide coverage for or payment for an amount representing the wholesale potato dealer's business transacted with growers within the state subject to the limits imposed in subsection (7). Liability for acts under a bond or payment pursuant to the irrevocable letter of credit shall be only for the period the license is in force.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Liability under the bond or payment pursuant to the irrevocable letter of credit shall be for a minimum of 1 year beginning with the effective date of coverage and shall be considered continuous or automatically extended thereafter until terminated or canceled as provided under the terms of the bond or letter of credit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A bond shall not be canceled and the amount of a bond shall not be reduced unless the surety company notifies the director in writing not less than 60 days before the effective date of cancellation or reduction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A letter of credit shall be irrevocable. The issuing financial institution shall notify the director in writing not less than 60 days before the irrevocable letter expires or if the financial institution has refused to renew a letter of credit to the wholesale potato dealer in compliance with this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The cancellation or expiration of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit operates as an automatic suspension of the wholesale potato dealer license unless security has been replaced within the 60-day period or unless the wholesale potato dealer has ceased business and has voluntarily relinquished the license. The wholesale potato dealer may request a hearing with the director to appeal the automatic suspension of the license if the request is in writing and received by the director within 10 days after the automatic suspension. If a bond or irrevocable letter of credit is obtained by the person after the 60-day period, he or she may reapply for licensure as a wholesale potato dealer. The director shall submit to existing state industry trade publications the name of the person and the effective date of occurrence of the following circumstances:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Licenses which are revoked or suspended.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Reapplications for licensure under this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall not be released by the director during the claim period described in section 12(1) or while there are any verified claims pending. If the director is satisfied no claims reasonably exist, the bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be released promptly.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The amount of coverage of the bond or the amount in which the irrevocable letter of credit is issued by the financial institution shall be double the amount paid for all Michigan grown potatoes purchased from or handled for growers during the month in which the maximum volume of Michigan grown potatoes was bought or handled during the past calendar year except that the bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall not be in an amount less than $10,000.00, or more than $100,000.00. The total liability of the surety issuing the bond or the amount available against a sight draft drawn by the director against a financial institution issuing the letter of credit for claims of growers arising out of transactions involving wholesale potato dealers is limited to the amount of the bond or letter of credit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   In the case of a person initially entering business as a wholesale potato dealer, the director shall determine the amount of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit from the estimated amount of business to be done annually by the applicant.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   If during a licensing year the bond or irrevocable letter of credit filed by a licensee becomes less than required by this act due to an increase in the dollar volume of potato purchases, the director may issue an order requiring the licensee to increase a bond or file an additional letter of credit to cover the increase in gross dollar volume. Failure of a wholesale potato dealer to comply with an order of the director issued under this subsection is grounds for suspension or revocation of a license.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 11a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The director may periodically examine the records of a wholesale potato dealer. The director may examine the records of a wholesale potato dealer against whom a complaint alleging nonpayment has been made or whose license has been suspended and may inquire of other growers who have sold potatoes to the wholesale potato dealer within the past 6 months as to the payment for their potatoes. Inquiries may be made by the director by regular mail. Based on the results of the examination of records or of information obtained from inquiries, the director has standing to utilize any appropriate legal action in order to seize and protect in the name of the state and on behalf of the claimants the assets of the licensee. The director may order and conduct a hearing to determine the allowance of claims against the wholesale potato dealer, giving the party complained of notice of the filing of the complaint and the time and place of the hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the director shall report findings, render conclusions, and issue an order upon the matter complained of to the complainant and the respondent in each case, who shall have 15 calendar days following the date of issuance of the order in which to comply.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A wholesale potato dealer aggrieved by the decision of the director may appeal from the decision within 10 calendar days after the issuance of the order by leave to the circuit court of the county where the wholesale potato dealer resides. The wholesale potato dealer shall notify the director in writing if he or she files an appeal. If the wholesale potato dealer does not comply with the order within 15 days after its issuance, the director shall demand payment from the surety or draw upon the irrevocable letter of credit in an amount necessary to satisfy the claims determined to be due. If the amount of the surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit is insufficient to satisfy the allowed claims, the director may bring action against the seized assets of the wholesale potato dealer to further satisfy the amount of the claims. If less than the total amount of the claims is obtained, distribution shall be made pro rata to the claimants.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Upon full settlement of allowed claims from the bond, payment of a sight draft by the issuer of the irrevocable letter of credit, or liquidation of the assets of the wholesale potato dealer, the director shall return any remaining assets to the wholesale potato dealer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The director may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the wholesale potato dealer, his or her assets, or the surety on the bond or may take any appropriate action against the issuer of the irrevocable letter of credit for recovery of money due and owing to a grower or growers as provided in this act.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The Michigan bean commission of 9 voting members is created, consisting of a grower from each district created under section 2, 1 member at large, and 1 processor shipper handler member under section 4(2). The director and the dean of the college of agriculture and natural resources of Michigan State University, or their designees, are ex officio members without vote. An appointed member must be of legal voting age in this state, and must be a citizen and resident of this state. Commission members, except for the processor member, must be or must have been engaged in the actual growing or producing of beans within the state. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The terms of office of members of the commission are 3 years after the date of appointment or until their successors are appointed and qualified. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Not less than 5 years after June 29, 1989 and every 5 calendar years after that date, the commission may, with the advice and consent of the director and the commission of agriculture and rural development, reapportion the districts described in section 2. Reapportionment of the districts must be on the basis of 1 or more counties with the amount of planted dry bean acreage being as nearly equal as possible between districts except that if 1 county constitutes greater than 20% of the total bean production within the state, then that county may be divided into 2 or more relatively equal districts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) After the reapportionment described in subsection (3), if the residence of a member of the commission falls outside of the district for which he or she serves on the commission and falls within the district for which another member serves on the commission, then both members shall continue to serve on the commission for a term equal to the remaining term of the member who served for the longest period of time. If after the reapportionment described in subsection (3) a district is created in which no member serving on the commission resides, then a member must be selected in a manner described in section 4(2).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Notwithstanding any requirements adopted under section 28c, the gross weight of a vehicle shall be determined by weighing the vehicle in a single measurement for a vehicle that is not a tractor-trailer combination and not by adding the results of multiple measurements taken at opposite ends of the vehicle. The gross weight of any tractor-trailer combination shall be determined by the method described in subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The gross weight combination of a truck tractor with multiple trailers shall be determined without uncoupling and by using a method of split weighing and combining the measurements, if necessary, if the following conditions are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The brakes on the tractor and trailers shall be released.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) There shall be no tension on the draw bar.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The approaches to the scale shall be straight and on the same level as the scale.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The approaches to the scale shall be of sufficient width and length to ensure level positioning of the coupled vehicles during weighing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A scale used to weigh vehicles under subsection (2) shall be tested at least annually or upon repair or maintenance of the weights and measures device, by weighing a coupled tractor with multiple trailers as a single unit and comparing that weight with the combined weight of each vehicle weighed separately. If the weights determined by this method vary by more than 0.2%, the scale shall not be used to determine the gross weight of vehicles while they are coupled until the scales are corrected to properly measure within the 0.2% range. All testing data shall be recorded and the records retained on site by the owner or operator and made available to the department for review upon request.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a scale cannot be used to weigh vehicles under subsection (2) while they are coupled, the vehicles shall be weighed individually and the weights totaled to obtain the gross weight of the vehicle combination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) This section does not apply to the enforcement of vehicle weight under the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.1 to 257.923.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The director may suspend, deny, or revoke a license issued pursuant to this act for failure to comply with the requirements provided for in section 3, for failure to provide notice as provided in section 4, or for violating section 31 of the weights and measures act, 1964 PA 283, MCL 290.631, if that violation occurs at any of the licensee's retail outlets and involves the transferring, selling, dispensing, or the offering for sale of gasoline in this state, or for otherwise failing to comply with this act or a rule promulgated under this act or an order issued under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a person licensed under this act is convicted of an intentional violation under section 31 of the weights and measures act, 1964 PA 283, MCL 290.631, any license issued pursuant to this act shall be revoked for 2 years.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A dispensing facility in Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Washtenaw, Livingston, Monroe, or St. Clair County constructed after November 15, 1990 shall obtain a dispensing permit. The fee for a dispensing permit is $25.00 for each year or portion of a year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The department shall not issue a dispensing permit unless the dispensing facility has installed an approved stage I vapor-recovery system and, in addition to the fee for the dispensing permit, paid a registration fee for each dispensing unit located at the dispensing facility. A permit shall not be issued or renewed until all fees and administrative fines issued under section 10a are paid. A hearing is not required before the refusal to issue or renew a permit under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A dispensing permit expires annually on November 30 unless renewed before December 1 of each year or unless suspended, denied, or revoked by the department. Application for a dispensing permit shall be made on a form furnished by the department. The completed form shall contain the information requested by the department and shall be accompanied by the fees specified.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The director may suspend, deny, or revoke a dispensing permit issued pursuant to this act for failure to pay the fee required by subsection (1) or (2) or for failure to comply with the requirements of sections 9a to 10c or rules promulgated thereunder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A fee shall be charged to the operator of stage I vapor-recovery or gasoline-dispensing equipment for its inspection if any of the following occur:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The inspection is a reinspection of equipment that has already been tested and found to contain a substantial defect. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The inspection is performed at the request of the operator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The department shall establish the fees and expenses for special services, including the fee for an operator requested inspection or reinspection, for registrations, for training courses, and for accreditation of a trainer, to provide that each fee is sufficient to cover the cost of the service for which the fee is charged and that the aggregate of all fees collected is sufficient to pay for all salaries and other expenses connected with the activity. The department shall review and adjust the fees at the end of each year and obtain the director's approval of all fees before they are adopted. Fees collected under this section shall be deposited in the gasoline inspection and testing fund and reserved for conducting the vapor-recovery program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Subject to subsection (2), the department shall issue an initial or renewal permit not later than 120 days after the applicant files a completed application. If the application is considered incomplete by the department, the department shall notify the applicant in writing or make notification electronically available within 40 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The 120-day period is tolled upon notification by the department of a deficiency until the date all of the information requested during the 40-day period is received by the department. The determination of the completeness of an application is not an approval of the application for the permit and does not confer eligibility to an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a permit. Requests for new or additional information by the department that fall outside the initial 40-day period do not toll the 120-day period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the department does not issue or deny a permit within 120 days after the receipt of a completed application, the department shall return the permit fee and shall reduce the permit fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. The failure to issue a permit within the time required under this subsection does not allow the department to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and that application, upon completion, shall be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The department shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of an application based on the fact that the application fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B> (9) As used in this section, "completed application" means an application complete on its face and submitted with any applicable permitting fees as well as any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of this state.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B> (1) A gasoline refiner, distributor, or terminal may petition the department for a temporary variance from the vapor pressure standards established by the director or in this act. In order to receive a variance, the refiner, distributor, or terminal shall demonstrate that fuel necessary to meet the current standard cannot be supplied and that the refiner, distributor, or terminal has taken and will continue to take all reasonable steps to minimize the vapor pressure of fuel during the period the variance is in effect. If the department finds that the reason fuel that would allow the refiner, distributor, or terminal to meet the standard is not available is beyond the control of the refiner, distributor, or terminal and that compliance with the vapor pressure standard would result in fuel shortages that cannot otherwise be made up, the department may grant the variance. The variance shall be granted only for the minimum period necessary and in no event shall the department grant a variance for longer than 20 days.

The department shall collect the fines on forms generated by the department and shall establish a payment schedule for payment of fines. Fines collected under this section shall be deposited in the gasoline inspection and testing fund established in section 8 and shall be appropriated annually by the legislature for air quality mitigation projects in the geographic area covered by the applicable state implementation plan requirement for low vapor pressure fuel.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 5.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Assessments shall be collected from each producer of a marketable agricultural commodity produced in this state and directly affected by a marketing program issued for the agricultural commodity to defray all program and administrative costs except for nonparticipating producers as provided for under section 3(1)(k). Assessments shall be collected on agricultural commodity inputs in this state directly affected by a marketing program established for the agricultural commodity input in order to defray all marketing program and administrative costs. Subject to approval by the director, assessments may also be collected from either producers or distributors, or both, and manufacturers, of a marketable agricultural commodity produced in this state or an agricultural commodity input used in this state if the director determines that the unique nature of the agricultural commodity or agricultural commodity input or the industry structure warrants the assessment of both the producer and the distributors of the agricultural commodity or agricultural commodity input.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Each marketing program shall specify the maximum assessment on an agricultural commodity or an agricultural commodity input and may provide for any other assessment mechanism as approved by the director to be collected to cover program and administrative costs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Pursuant to the marketing program and for convenience, the processors, distributors, or handlers of the agricultural commodity or agricultural commodity input may be required to collect and remit producer assessments to the committee at no cost to the marketing program unless the marketing program expressly provides for the payment of a reasonable fee for making the deduction and remittance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In the case of a marketing program that provides for the imposition of an assessment, the processors, distributors, or handlers dealing with the producer shall collect the assessment from the producer by deducting the assessment from the gross amount owing to the producer and shall remit the assessment and data to the committee within a reasonable time period as established by the committee. A processor, distributor, or handler who fails to deduct or remit the assessment is liable to the committee for any assessments not deducted or remitted. If a processor, distributor, or handler is not involved at the first point of sale of an agricultural commodity or agricultural commodity input, or is not within this state and the assessment is not deducted and remitted, the producer shall remit the assessments to the committee on all sales of the agricultural commodity or agricultural commodity input, subject to a marketing program and within a time period specified by the committee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   All assessments deducted or collected and held by a processor, distributor, or handler for over 92 days shall be deposited in a separate interest bearing escrow account held jointly with the marketing program committee and not commingled with other funds. Interest accrued in the escrow account shall be forwarded to the committee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   All assessments collected or deducted shall be considered trust funds and be remitted quarterly or more frequently if required by the marketing program to the appropriate committee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   A committee may file a written complaint with the director documenting that a processor, distributor, handler, or producer has failed to deduct or remit any assessment due to the committee pursuant to a marketing program. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the director shall conduct an investigation of the allegations. If, after investigation, the director finds that the processor, distributor, handler, or producer has failed to deduct or remit an assessment to the committee, the director shall request by certified mail the processor, distributor, handler, or producer to remit the assessment within 10 days after the director determines that a deduction or remittance was not made. In the case of the failure to deduct an assessment, the director shall compute the amount that reasonably should have been deducted and impose an assessment in that amount. If the assessment is not remitted within 30 days after the request or is not in compliance with a written agreement for full payment, the director may file an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to collect the assessment. Venue in such an action is the place where the processor, distributor, handler, or producer has its primary place of business. In any action to recover an assessment under this subsection, if the director prevails, the court shall award to the director all costs and expenses in bringing the action, including, but not limited to, reasonable and actual attorney fees, court costs, and audit expenses. If the director does not prevail, he or she shall charge the committee for reasonable and actual attorney fees, court costs, and expenses incurred in bringing about the action.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Each committee shall specify the date the assessment is due in the account of the marketing program on that production. Producers, processors, distributors, or handlers of the affected agricultural commodity or agricultural commodity input shall be given reasonable notice of the due date.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   A committee established pursuant to this act has the ability to borrow money in anticipation of the receipt of assessments if the following conditions are met:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The loan will not be requested or authorized, or will not mature, within 90 days before a resubmittal or termination referendum for the marketing program.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   The amount of the loan does not exceed 50% of the annual average assessment revenue during the previous 3 years. In the case of a marketing program that has been in existence for less than 3 years, the loan does not exceed 25% of the projected annual assessment revenue.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   The loan repayment period does not exceed the life of the marketing program.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)   The loan has the prior written consent of the director. The director may request an audit of the committee by the auditor general before approving the loan.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The director shall assess against the agricultural commodity input or the producers of the agricultural commodity all outstanding loans, including interest, approved under subsection (h) if the marketing program is inactive or is terminated.</DIV>

Nominating procedures, qualifications, representation, term of office, and size of the committee shall be prescribed in the marketing program for which the committee is appointed. Each committee shall be composed of producers and handlers or processors who are directly affected by the marketing program in the proportion of representation as prescribed by the program. The term of office of a committee member is 3 years or until such time as his or her successor is appointed and qualified.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The director or his or her representative shall serve as a nonvoting ex officio member. Additional nonvoting ex officio members may serve if approved for in a specific marketing program.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A committee, with the advice and consent of the director and the commission of agriculture, may reapportion either the number of committee members or member districts, or both. Reapportionment of the districts shall be on the basis of production or industry representation. The reapportionment may be commenced 30 days after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection. Reapportionment of either members or districts shall not occur more often than twice in any 5-year period and shall not occur within 6 months before a referendum.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   After the reapportionment described in subsection (4), if the residence of a member of the committee falls outside of the district for which he or she serves on the committee and falls within the district for which another member serves on the committee, then both members shall continue to serve on the committee for a term equal to the remaining term of the member who served for the longest period of time. After the reapportionment described in subsection (4), if a district is created in which no member serving on the committee resides, then a member shall be selected in the manner as prescribed in each program. After a reapportionment or redistricting, a committee may temporarily have more members than prescribed in the marketing program until the expiration of the term of the longest serving member from that district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A member of a committee is entitled to reimbursement for actual expenses and a per diem payment to be set by the committee not to exceed the commission of agriculture rate while attending meetings of the committee or while engaged in the performance of official responsibilities delegated by the committee.</DIV>

Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall cause notice to be served upon the person complained of, and thereupon shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question to be determined, and may grant temporary relief or restraining order as it considers just and proper and make and enter a decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the department. An objection that has not been urged before the department or a hearing officer shall not be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge the objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances. The findings of the department with respect to questions of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. If either party applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shows to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce the evidence in the hearing before the department, the court may order additional evidence to be taken before the department or hearing officer and to be made a part of the record. The department may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of additional evidence so taken and filed, and it shall file the modified or new findings, which findings with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive, and shall file its recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original order. Upon the filing of the record with the court, the jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment and decree shall be final, except that it shall be subject to review in accordance with established procedures for appeal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Any person aggrieved by a final order of the department granting or denying in whole or in part the relief sought may obtain a review of an order in the court of appeals, by filing in the court a written petition requesting that the order of the department be modified or set aside. A copy of the petition shall be transmitted by the clerk of the court to the department, and the aggrieved party shall file in the court the record in the proceeding certified by the department. Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall proceed in the same manner as in the case of an application by the department under this section and shall have the same jurisdiction to grant temporary relief or a restraining order as it considers just and proper, and in like manner to make and enter a decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the department.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The association has submitted a copy of its bylaws, which shall provide all of the following:</div>

The department may determine the quantity produced by the bargaining unit using information on production in prior marketing periods, current market information, and projections on production during the current marketing period. The department shall exclude from that quantity any quantity of the agricultural commodity contracted by producers with producer owned and controlled processing cooperatives and any quantity produced by handlers. An association whose main purpose is bargaining but which processes a surplus into a form which is not the subject of bargaining is not a processing cooperative. The contracts with members shall specify the agricultural commodity and that the members have appointed the association as their exclusive agent in negotiations with handlers for prices and other terms of trade with respect to the sale and marketing of the agricultural commodity and obligate them to dispose of their production or holdings of the agricultural commodity through or at the direction of the association.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The association has established and authorized a marketing and bargaining committee to negotiate with handlers for the agricultural commodity. The committee shall be composed of members elected by the members in a secret ballot election. The production of the agricultural commodity shall comprise a significant portion of the total farming operation of each committee member. Members who have any quantity of the commodity contracted with a producer owned and controlled processing cooperative are not eligible to serve on a marketing and bargaining committee for such commodity.</div>
