<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Each local exchange provider within a 9-1-1 service district shall provide a billing and collection service for an emergency telephone technical charge from all service users, except for users of a prepaid wireless telecommunications service, of the provider within the geographical boundaries of the emergency telephone or 9-1-1 service district. The billing and collection of the emergency telephone technical charge must begin as soon as feasible after the final 9-1-1 service plan has been approved. The billing and collection of the emergency telephone technical charge not already collected for billing costs shall begin as soon as feasible after installation and operation of the 9-1-1 system. The emergency telephone technical charge must be uniform per each exchange access facility within the 9-1-1 service district. The portion of the emergency telephone technical charge that represents start-up costs, nonrecurring billing, installation, service, and equipment charges of the service supplier, including the costs of updating equipment necessary for conversion to 9-1-1 service, must be amortized at the prime rate plus 1% over a period not to exceed 10 years and billed and collected from all service users only until those amounts are fully recouped by the service supplier. The prime rate to be used for amortization must be set before the first assessment of nonrecurring charges and remain at that rate for 5 years, at which time a new rate may be set for the remaining amortization period. Recurring costs and charges included in the emergency telephone technical charge must continue to be billed to the service user.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Until 59 days after the effective date of the 2018 amendatory act that amended this section, the amount of the emergency telephone technical charge to be billed to the service user must be computed by dividing the total emergency telephone technical charge by the number of exchange access facilities within the 9-1-1 service district. Beginning 60 days after the effective date of the 2018 amendatory act that amended this section, the amount of the emergency telephone technical charge to be billed to the service user must be computed by dividing the total emergency telephone technical charge costs in all 9-1-1 service districts in this state by the number of exchange access facilities within all 9-1-1 service districts in this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The amount of emergency telephone technical charge payable monthly by a service user for recurring costs and charges must not exceed 4% of the lesser of $20.00 or the highest monthly rate charged by the local exchange provider for primary basic local exchange service within the 9-1-1 service district. The amount of emergency telephone technical charge payable monthly by a service user for nonrecurring costs and charges must not exceed 5% of the lesser of $20.00 or the highest monthly rate charged by the provider for primary basic local exchange service within the 9-1-1 service district. The difference, if any, between the amount of the emergency telephone technical charge computed under subsection (2) and the maximum permitted under this section must be paid by the county from funds available to the county or through cooperative arrangements with public agencies within the 9-1-1 service district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The emergency telephone technical charge must be collected in accordance with the regular billings of the local exchange provider. The emergency telephone technical charge payable by service users under this act must be added to and stated separately in the billings to service users or otherwise disclosed to the consumer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) As used in this section, "local exchange provider" means a provider of basic local exchange service as that term is defined in section 102 of the Michigan telecommunications act, 1991 PA 179, MCL 484.2102.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Establish by order the manner and form in which telecommunication providers of regulated services within the state keep accounts, books of accounts, and records in order to determine the total service long-run incremental cost requirements of this act of providing a service. The commission requirements under this subdivision shall be consistent with any regulations covering the same subject matter made by the federal communications commission.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Upon receipt of an application or complaint filed under this act, or on its own motion, the commission may conduct an investigation, hold hearings, and issue its findings and order under the contested hearings provisions of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a complaint filed under this section alleges facts that warrant emergency relief, the complainant may request an emergency relief order. On the date of filing, the complaint and request for emergency relief shall be hand-delivered to the respondent at its principal place of business in Michigan. The commission shall allow 5 business days for a filing in response to the request for emergency relief. The commission shall review the complaint, the request for emergency relief, the response, and all supporting materials and determine whether to deny the request for emergency relief or to conduct an initial evidentiary hearing. The initial evidentiary hearing shall be conducted within 5 business days from the date of the notice of hearing and the commission shall issue an order granting or denying the request for emergency relief. An order for emergency relief may require a party to act or refrain from action to protect competition. Any action required by an order for emergency relief shall be technically feasible and economically reasonable and the respondent shall be given a reasonable period of time to comply with the order. At the hearing for emergency relief, the respondent has the burden of showing that the order is not technically feasible and not economically reasonable. If the commission finds that extraordinary circumstances exist that warrant expedited review before the commission's issuance of a final order, it shall set a schedule providing for the issuance of a partial final order as to all or part of the issues for which emergency relief was granted within 90 days of the issuance of the emergency relief order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An order for emergency relief may be granted under subsection (2) if the commission finds all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That the party has demonstrated exigent circumstances that warrant emergency relief.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That the party seeking relief will likely succeed on the merits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) That the party will suffer irreparable harm in its ability to serve customers if emergency relief is not granted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) That the order is not adverse to the public interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The commission may require the complainant to post a bond in an amount sufficient to make whole the respondent in the event that the order for emergency relief is later found to have been erroneously granted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An order for emergency relief shall expire upon the sooner of any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Ninety days after its issuance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Issuance of the commission's partial final order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An earlier date set by the commission. Notwithstanding this subsection, the commission may extend the emergency relief order to a date no later than the date on which the final order in the proceeding is issued.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An order granting or denying emergency relief under subsection (2) shall be subject to immediate review in the court of appeals as a matter of right by the party aggrieved. The review shall be de novo and shall comply with Michigan court rule 7.211(c)(6). The court may stay an order granting emergency relief upon the posting of a bond or other security in an amount and on terms set by the court. Regardless of whether an appeal is made under this subsection, the commission shall proceed with the case and issue a final order as otherwise required under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An application or complaint filed under this section shall contain all information, testimony, exhibits, or other documents and information within the person's possession on which the person intends to rely to support the application or complaint. Applications or complaints that do not meet the requirements of this subsection shall be dismissed or suspended pending the receipt by the commission of the required information. If the complainant or applicant requires information in the possession of the respondent, not within the complainant's or applicant's possession, the commission may allow a reasonable opportunity for discovery to allow the complainant or applicant to provide all relevant information, testimony, exhibits, or other documents on which the complainant or applicant intends to rely to support its application or complaint.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The burden of proving a case filed under this act is with the party filing the application or complaint.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) In a contested case under this section, the commission can administer oaths, certify all official acts, and compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of papers, books, accounts, documents, and testimony.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the commission shall issue a final order in a case filed under this section within 90 days from the date the application or complaint is filed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Except as provided for a hearing involving a request for emergency relief, if a hearing is required, the applicant or complainant shall publish a notice of hearing as required by the commission within 7 days of the date the application or complaint was filed or as required by the commission. The first hearing shall be held within 10 days after the date of the notice. If a hearing is held, the commission shall have 180 days from the date the application or complaint was filed to issue its final order. If the principal parties of record agree that the complexity of issues involved requires additional time, the commission may have up to 210 days from the date the application or complaint was filed to issue its final order. If the application or complaint is subject to section 203a, the commission shall have an additional 60 days to issue its final order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) An order of the commission under this act is subject to appellate review as of right in the court of appeals. The appeal shall be initiated by the filing of a claim of appeal with the court of appeals within 30 days of the issuance of an order or within 30 days of an order issued on a petition for rehearing of an order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) If a complaint is filed under this section by a provider against another provider, the provider of service shall not discontinue service during the period of the contested case, including the alternative dispute process, if the provider receiving the service has posted a surety bond, provided an irrevocable letter of credit, or provided other adequate security in an amount and on a form as determined by the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) Except if there is a request for emergency relief under this section, if the complaint filed under this section involves an interconnection dispute between providers, the commission shall require the parties to utilize the alternative dispute process under section 203a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) In addition to any other relief provided by this act, the commission or a party may seek to compel compliance with a commission order by proceedings in mandamus, injunction, or by other appropriate civil remedies in the circuit court or other court of proper jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) Upon the filing of a motion for stay, the commission may, on terms as it considers just, stay the effect or enforcement of an order, except an order regarding rates or cost studies. A motion for stay, including a request for setting the amount of any appeal bond, are governed by the provisions for obtaining a stay of a civil action set forth in R 7.209 of the Michigan court rules. The commission shall decide a motion for stay within 10 days from the date the motion is filed with the commission.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided by this section, the commission shall not review or set the rates for toll access services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A provider of toll access services shall set the rates for intrastate switched toll access services at rates that do not exceed the rates allowed for the same interstate services by the federal government and shall use the access rate elements for intrastate switched toll access services that are in effect for that provider and are allowed for the same interstate services by the federal government. Eligible providers shall comply with this subsection as of the date established for the commencement of the operation of the restructuring mechanism under subsection (9). Providers other than eligible providers shall not charge intrastate toll access service rates in excess of those rates in effect as of July 1, 2009 and shall reduce the differential, if any, between intrastate and interstate switched toll access service rates in effect as of July 1, 2009 in no more than 5 steps of at least 20% each of the differential on the following dates: January 1, 2011; January 1, 2012; January 1, 2013; January 1, 2014; and January 1, 2015. Providers may agree to a rate that is less than the rate allowed by the federal government.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Two or more providers that each have less than 250,000 access lines may agree to joint toll access service rates and pooling of intrastate toll access service revenues.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A provider of toll access services shall make available for intrastate access services any technical interconnection arrangements, including colocation required by the federal government for the identical interstate access services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A provider of toll access service, whether under tariff or contract, shall offer the services under the same rates, terms, and conditions, without unreasonable discrimination, to all providers. All pricing of special toll access services and switched access services, including volume discounts, shall be offered to all providers under the same rates, terms, and conditions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a toll access service rate is reduced, then the provider receiving the reduced rate shall reduce its rate to its customers by an equal amount. The commission may investigate and ensure that the provider has complied with this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) In order to restructure intrastate switched toll access service rates, there is hereby established in the department of licensing and regulatory affairs an intrastate switched toll access rate restructuring mechanism as a separate interest-bearing fund. The state treasurer shall direct the investment of the restructuring mechanism. Money in the restructuring mechanism shall remain in the restructuring mechanism at the close of the fiscal year and shall not revert to the general fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) An eligible provider is entitled to receive monthly disbursements from the restructuring mechanism as provided in subsection (11) in order to recover the lost intrastate switched toll access service revenues resulting from rate reductions under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The restructuring mechanism shall be administered by the commission. The restructuring mechanism shall be established and shall begin operation by September 13, 2010. Subject to the preceding sentence, the commission shall establish the date for commencing the operation of the restructuring mechanism and shall notify the participants in the restructuring mechanism at least 30 days in advance of that date. The commission shall recover its actual costs of administering the restructuring mechanism from assessments collected for the operation of the restructuring mechanism. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The commission shall establish the procedures and timelines for organizing, funding, and administering the restructuring mechanism. The commission shall report to the legislature and the governor annually regarding the administration of the restructuring mechanism. The report shall include the total amount of money collected from contributing providers, the total amount of money disbursed from the restructuring mechanism annually to each eligible provider, the costs of administration, and any other information considered relevant by the commission. The report shall also identify any duplicative costs or revenues that are already being recovered by eligible providers through federal access recovery charges or the connect America fund. If the commission identifies duplicative recovery, the commission shall notify the federal communications commission and all contributing providers. Any duplicative recovery identified by the commission is not exempt from public disclosure under section 210. Beginning with the first report following the recalculation required under subsection (16), the annual report shall include recommendations for altering the restructuring mechanism, based on the results of the recalculation and the state and federal regulations in effect at the time, to ensure that the restructuring mechanism is still achieving the purposes for which it was originally established. Any company-specific information pertaining to access lines, switched toll access services minutes of use, switched toll access demand quantities, contributions, and intrastate telecommunication services revenues submitted to the commission under this subsection are confidential commercial or financial information and exempt from public disclosure under section 210. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The initial size of the restructuring mechanism shall be calculated as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) By February 15, 2010 each eligible provider shall submit to the commission information and all the supporting documentation that establishes the amount of the reduction in annual intrastate switched toll access revenues that will result from the reduction in rates required in subsection (2). The reduction shall be calculated for each eligible provider as the difference between intrastate and interstate switched toll access service rates in effect as of July 1, 2009, multiplied by the intrastate switched access minutes of use and other switched access demand quantities for the calendar year 2008.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The commission shall compute the size of the initial restructuring mechanism disbursements for each eligible provider and shall inform each eligible provider of that computation within 60 days after receiving the information and supporting documentation from the eligible providers under subdivision (a).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The restructuring mechanism shall be created and supported by a mandatory monthly contribution by all providers of retail intrastate telecommunication services and all providers of commercial mobile service. Interconnected voice over internet protocol services shall not be considered an intrastate telecommunication service for the purposes of this section and interconnected voice over internet protocol service providers shall not be required to pay, directly or indirectly, the mandatory monthly contributions established in this subsection. A provider of telecommunication services to a provider of interconnected voice over internet protocol services shall not pay a mandatory monthly contribution related to those interconnected voice over internet protocol services or attempt to pass through any mandatory monthly contributions, directly or indirectly, to a provider of interconnected voice over internet protocol services. Nothing in this act grants the commission authority over commercial mobile service providers or voice over internet protocol service providers except as is strictly necessary for administration of the restructuring mechanism.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) By February 15, 2010, each contributing provider shall report its 2008 intrastate retail telecommunication services revenues to the commission. Notwithstanding anything in subsection (12), if the federal communications commission determines that interconnected voice over internet protocol services may be subject to state regulation for universal services purposes, the commission may open a proceeding to determine who is required to participate in a universal service fund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) The initial contribution assessment percentage shall be a uniform percentage of retail intrastate telecommunication services revenues determined by projecting the total amount necessary to cover the initial intrastate switched toll access rate restructuring mechanism disbursement levels for 12 months, including projected cash reserve requirements, actual and projected administrative costs, and projected uncollectible contribution assessments, divided by the 2008 calendar year total retail intrastate telecommunication services revenues in this state, less projected uncollectible revenues, reported to the commission. The commission shall issue an order establishing the initial calculation of the contribution assessment percentage by May 16, 2010. The commission may increase or decrease the contribution assessment on a quarterly or other basis as necessary to maintain sufficient funds for disbursements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) Each contributing provider shall remit to the commission on a monthly basis an amount equal to its intrastate retail telecommunication services revenues, less uncollectible revenues, multiplied by the contribution assessment percentage determined under subsection (14), according to a time frame established by the commission. These contributions shall continue until the end of the period for which eligible providers are entitled to receive monthly disbursements from the restructuring mechanism under subsections (11) and (16).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) The commission shall recalculate the size of the restructuring mechanism for each eligible provider on March 13, 2018. The recalculation process shall be as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The restructuring mechanism shall be recalculated as the difference between the intrastate switched toll access rates in effect as of July 1, 2009 and the interstate switched toll access rates in effect at the time of the recalculation, multiplied by the intrastate switched toll access minutes of use and other switched access demand quantities for the calendar year 2008.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The recalculated restructuring mechanism shall be further adjusted during the recalculation by the percentage change, if any, in the number of access lines in service for each eligible provider from December 31, 2008 to December 31 of the year immediately preceding the year in which the adjustment is made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Each eligible provider is entitled to receive monthly disbursements from the restructuring mechanism for a period of no more than 12 years from the date the restructuring mechanism is established under subsection (9), at which time the restructuring mechanism shall cease to exist.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The commission shall reduce the amount of the monthly disbursement to an eligible provider from the restructuring mechanism on a pro rata basis for each exchange in which the provider discontinues basic local exchange service under section 313. A reduction under this subsection is effective on the date of the discontinuance of service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) The money received and administered by the commission for the support and operation of the restructuring mechanism created by 2009 PA 182 shall not be used by the commission or any department, agency, or branch of the government of this state for any other purpose, and that money is not subject to appropriation, allocation, assignment, expenditure, or other use by any department, agency, or branch of the government of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) If the federal government adopts intercarrier compensation reforms or takes any action that causes or requires a significant change in interstate switched toll access service rates, the commission may initiate, or any interested party may file an application for, a proceeding under section 203 within 60 days of that action to determine whether any modifications to the size, operation, or composition of the restructuring mechanism are warranted. During the pendency of that proceeding, the requirement in subsection (2) for eligible providers to set intrastate switched toll access service rates equal to interstate switched toll access service shall be temporarily suspended by those providers. Intrastate access rates may not be increased above the levels that exist at the time of the suspension. Following notice and hearing, upon a showing of good cause, the commission may stop or place certain conditions on the temporary suspension.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) If the federal government changes the federal universal service contribution methodology so that it is not based on a percentage of total interstate telecommunication services revenues, the commission shall modify the contribution methodology for the restructuring mechanism to be consistent with the federal methodology. The commission shall initiate a proceeding to modify the contribution methodology for the restructuring mechanism and to establish a reasonable time period for transition to the new contribution methodology.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) Disputes arising under this section may be submitted to the commission for resolution under sections 203 and 204.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) If any contributing provider subject to this section fails to make the required contributions or fails to provide required information to the commission, the commission shall initiate an enforcement proceeding under section 203. If the commission finds that a contributing provider has failed to make contributions or to perform any act required under this section, a contributing provider is subject to the remedies and penalties under section 601.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) Eligible providers and contributing providers shall provide information to the commission that is required for the administration of the restructuring mechanism. Company-specific information pertaining to access lines, switched toll access services minutes of use, switched toll access demand quantities, contributions, and intrastate telecommunication services revenues submitted to the commission under this subsection is confidential commercial or financial information and exempt from public disclosure under section 210.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(23) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Commercial mobile service" means that term as defined in section 332(d)(1) of the telecommunications act of 1996, 47 USC 332.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Contributing provider" means an entity required to pay into the restructuring mechanism. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Eligible provider" means an incumbent local exchange carrier as defined in section 251(h) of the telecommunications act of 1996, 47 USC 251, that as of January 1, 2009 had rates for intrastate switched toll access services higher than its rates for the same interstate switched toll access services, and that provides the services and functionalities identified by rules of the federal communications commission described at 47 CFR 54.101(a). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Interconnected voice over internet protocol service" means that term as defined in 47 CFR 9.3.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A telecommunication provider proposing to discontinue a regulated service to an exchange shall file a notice of the discontinuance of service with the commission, publish the notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the exchange, provide notice to each of its customers within the exchange by first-class mail or within customer bills, and provide other reasonable notice as required by the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Within 60 days after the date of publication or receipt of the notice required by subsection (2), a person or other telecommunication provider affected by a discontinuance of services by a telecommunication provider may apply to the commission to determine if the discontinuance of service is authorized under this act. Within 90 days after the date of publication of the notice required by subsection (2), the commission may, in response to a request or on its own initiative, commence a proceeding to determine if the discontinuance of service is authorized under this act. The commission has 180 days from the date any proceeding is initiated under this subsection to issue its final order. A provider shall not discontinue service unless it has provided at least 60 days' notice to each customer after a commission order has been issued under this subsection or after the last day for initiating a proceeding under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Discontinuance of basic local exchange service under this section by an incumbent local exchange carrier does not affect the requirements of that incumbent local exchange carrier under federal law and this act. As used in this subdivision, "incumbent local exchange carrier" means that term as defined in section 251(h) of the telecommunications act of 1996, 47 USC 251. This section does not create, restrict, or expand the commission's jurisdiction and authority for any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The jurisdiction and authority established under section 201.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The jurisdiction and authority to carry out the commission's obligations to enforce the rights, duties, and obligations of an entity that are established in sections 251 and 252 of the telecommunications act of 1996, 47 USC 251 and 252, and any applicable agreement or wholesale tariff or state law, rule, regulation, or order related to wholesale rights, duties, and obligations, including, but not limited to, interconnection and exchange voice traffic.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The jurisdiction and authority to regulate switched access rates, terms, and conditions, including the implementation of federal or state law concerning intercarrier compensation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Subsections (1) to (3) do not apply after December 31, 2016. Beginning January 1, 2017, a telecommunication provider that provides basic local exchange or toll service may discontinue that service in an exchange by doing each of the following: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) At the same time as filing a petition under section 214 of the telecommunications act of 1996, 47 USC 214, all of the following: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) File a notice of the proposed discontinuance of service with the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Publish a notice of the proposed discontinuance of service in a newspaper of general circulation within the exchange.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Provide notice of the proposed discontinuance of service to each of the telecommunication provider's customers within the exchange by first-class mail or within customer bills.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Provide notice of the proposed discontinuance of service to any interconnecting telecommunication providers by first-class mail or other notice permitted under the terms of the interconnection agreement between the providers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Upon approval of the federal communications commission to discontinue service, at least 90 days before discontinuing service, all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) File a notice of the discontinuance of service with the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Publish a notice of the discontinuance of service in a newspaper of general circulation within the exchange.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Provide notice of the discontinuance of service to each of the telecommunication provider's customers within the exchange by first-class mail or within customer bills.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Provide notice to any interconnecting telecommunication providers by first-class mail or other notice permitted under the terms of the interconnection agreement between the providers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) After January 1, 2017, and only in an area in which a telecommunication provider either has given notice of a proposed discontinuance of service under subsection (5) or has discontinued service within the previous 90 days, a customer of that provider or any interconnecting telecommunication provider may request the commission to investigate the availability of comparable voice service with reliable access to 9-1-1 and emergency services to that customer or a customer of an interconnecting telecommunication provider. If the commission, after conducting an investigation to last no longer than 180 days regarding the availability of comparable voice service with reliable access to 9-1-1 and emergency services, determines that the federal communications commission failed to make a finding that the present and future public convenience and necessity is not adversely affected or has not adequately addressed the issue, the commission shall declare by order that an emergency exists in an area in this state that is not served by at least 1 voice service provider offering comparable voice service with reliable access to 9-1-1 and emergency services through any technology or medium and shall conduct a request for service process to identify a willing provider of comparable voice service with reliable access to 9-1-1 and emergency services in that area, including the current provider. A provider shall not be required to participate in the request for service process. The willing provider may utilize any form of technology that is capable of providing comparable voice service with reliable access to 9-1-1 and emergency services, including voice over internet protocol services and wireless services. If the commission determines that another provider is not capable of providing comparable voice service with reliable access to 9-1-1 and emergency services in that area, the commission shall issue an order requiring the current telecommunication provider to provide comparable voice service with reliable access to 9-1-1 and emergency services in that area utilizing any form of technology that the commission determines is capable of providing comparable voice service with reliable access to 9-1-1 and emergency services, including voice over internet protocol services and wireless services, until another willing provider is available. An intrastate universal service fund under section 316a shall not be created or used to compensate or fund a willing provider or current telecommunication provider to provide service under this section. As used in this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Comparable voice service" includes any 2-way voice service offered through any form of technology, including voice over internet protocol services and wireless services, that is capable of placing calls to and receiving calls from a provider of basic local exchange service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Emergency services" means services provided to the public by police, fire, ambulance, or other first responders.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Reliable access to 9-1-1" means the rules, regulations, and guidelines set forth in the FCC trials order, including all appendices, that provide comparable and reliable consumer access to emergency services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Willing provider" means a provider that voluntarily participates in the request for service process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Beginning January 1, 2017, a telecommunication provider that discontinues service under this section shall adhere to all rules, regulations, and guidelines set forth in the FCC trials order, including all appendices, for each of that telecommunication provider's exchanges in this state, whether or not the discontinuance is undertaken pursuant to an official trial under the FCC trials order, except that all notices or reports to be filed with the federal communications commission shall be submitted to the Michigan public service commission for its information. This subsection is effective until the federal communications commission determines the legal and policy framework and establishes the requirements for the IP-transition including emergency connectivity requirements that provide comparable and reliable consumer access to emergency services. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this section, "FCC trials order" means the order of the federal communications commission, GN docket nos. 13-5 and 12-353, adopted January 30, 2014, and any subsequent order of the federal communications commission modifying or revising that order that includes emergency connectivity requirements that provide comparable and reliable consumer access to emergency services.</div>

<P>Sec. 506.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Upon the receipt of a complaint filed by a person alleging a violation of section 505 or 507, an end-user who has been switched to another provider or had services added in violation of section 505 or 507, or a provider who has been removed as an end-user's provider without the end-user's authorization, or upon the commission's own motion, the commission may conduct a contested case as provided under section 203. The commission shall create, and shall supply upon request, a form affidavit designed to enable an end-user to provide all information necessary to promote efficient resolution of complaints alleging a violation of section 505 or 507. Hearings conducted under this section shall comply with the following requirements:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Hearings shall be conducted in a manner as to optimize expediency, convenience, and the ability of end-users to bring and prosecute, without the assistance of counsel, complaints alleging violations of section 505 or 507, while preserving the rights of the parties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If possible, the commission shall hold the hearing at a location near the end-user's residence or place of business.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the commission finds that a person has violated section 505 or 507 or an order issued under section 505 or 507, the commission shall order remedies and penalties to protect and make whole end-users and other persons who have suffered damages as a result of the violation, including, but not limited to, 1 or more of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Order the person to pay a fine for the first offense of not less than $20,000.00 or more than $30,000.00. For a second and any subsequent offense, the commission shall order the person to pay a fine of not less than $30,000.00 or more than $50,000.00. If the commission finds that the second or any of the subsequent offenses were knowingly made in violation of section 505 or 507, the commission shall order the person to pay a fine of not more than $70,000.00. Each switch made in violation of section 505 or service added in violation of 507 shall be a separate offense under this subdivision.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Order an unauthorized provider to refund to the end-user any amount greater than the end-user would have paid to an authorized provider.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Order a portion between 10% to 50% of the fine assessed under subdivision (a) be paid directly to the customer who suffered the violation of section 505 or 507.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Order an unauthorized provider to reimburse an authorized provider an amount equal to the amount paid by the end-user that should have been paid to the authorized provider.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   If the person is licensed under this act, revoke the license if the commission finds a pattern of violations of section 505 or 507.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Issue cease and desist orders.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Notwithstanding subsection (2), a fine shall not be imposed for a violation of section 505 or 507 if the provider has otherwise fully complied with sections 505 and 507 and shows that the violation was an unintentional and bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adopted to avoid the error. Examples of a bona fide error include clerical, calculation, computer malfunction, programming, or printing errors. An error in legal judgment with respect to a person's obligations under section 505 is not a bona fide error. The burden of proving that a violation was an unintentional and bona fide error is on the provider.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the commission finds that a party's complaint or defense filed under this section is frivolous, the commission shall award to the prevailing party costs, including reasonable attorney fees, against the nonprevailing party and their attorney.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 8.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided by this act, a provider shall pay to the authority an annual maintenance fee as required under this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The authority shall determine for each provider the amount of fees required under this section. April 1 to March 31 shall be the annual period covered by each assessment and April 29 the date due for payment. The authority shall prescribe the schedule for the allocation and disbursement of the fees under this act. The authority shall disburse the annual maintenance fee to each municipality as provided under sections 10, 11, and 12 on or before the last day of the month following the month of receipt of the fees by the authority. The authority may authorize the department of treasury to collect and make the allocations and disbursements of fees required under this act. Any interest accrued on the revenue collected under this act shall be used only as provided by this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as otherwise provided under subsection (6), for the period of November 1, 2002 to March 31, 2003, a provider shall pay an initial annual maintenance fee to the authority on April 29, 2003 of 2 cents per each linear foot of public right-of-way occupied by the provider's facilities within a metropolitan area, prorated for the period specified in this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Except as otherwise provided under subsection (6), for each year after the initial period provided for under subsection (3), a provider shall pay the authority an annual maintenance fee of 5 cents per each linear foot of public right-of-way occupied by the provider's facilities within a metropolitan area.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The fee required under this section is based on the linear feet occupied by the provider regardless of the quantity or type of the provider's facilities utilizing the public right-of-way or whether the facilities are leased to another provider.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)    In recognition of the need to provide nondiscriminatory compensation to municipalities for management of their rights-of-way, the fees required under this section shall be the lesser of the amounts prescribed under subsections (3) and (4) or 1 of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   For a provider that was an incumbent local exchange carrier in this state on January 1, 2002, the fees within the exchange in which that provider was providing basic local exchange service on January 1, 2002, when restated by the authority on a per access line per year basis, shall not exceed the statewide per access line per year fee of the provider with the highest number of access lines in this state. The authority shall annually determine the statewide per access line per year fee by dividing the amount of the total annual fees the provider is required to pay under subsections (3) and (4) by the provider's total number of access lines in this state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   For all other providers in an exchange, the fee per linear foot for the provider's facilities located in the public rights-of-way in that exchange shall be the same as that of the incumbent local exchange carrier.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If the provider with the highest number of access lines in this state is unable to provide the exact number of linear feet for a determination under subsection (6), the provider shall no later than February 1, 2003 make a good faith estimate, in consultation with the staff of the authority, of the number of linear feet of rights-of-way in which facilities owned by the provider are located in a metropolitan area and pay an annual maintenance fee to the authority based upon the estimate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If an estimate of the linear feet is made under subsection (7), the statewide per access line per year cost shall be determined by the authority based on that provider's good faith estimate. Upon the true up of the estimated linear feet under subsection (9), the authority shall adjust the fees of all providers affected by subsection (6).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   Within 360 days of the effective date of this act, a provider making an estimate under subsection (8) shall true up the estimated amount of linear feet of the provider's facilities in rights-of-way in a metropolitan area to the actual amount of linear feet of rights-of-way in a metropolitan area owned by the provider. If the actual amount of linear feet of rights-of-way in which facilities owned by the provider are located exceeds the estimated amount, the provider shall pay the authority the difference within 30 days of the true up. If the actual amount of linear feet of rights-of-way in which facilities owned by the provider are located is less than the estimated amount, the provider shall receive a corresponding credit from the authority against the annual maintenance fee due for payment in the succeeding year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   The authority may prescribe the forms, standards, methodology, and procedures for assessing fees under this act. Each provider and municipality shall provide reasonably requested information regarding public rights-of-way that is required to assist the authority in computing and issuing the assessments under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, a provider possessing a franchise or operating with the consent of a municipality to provide and that is providing cable services within a metropolitan area is subject to an annual maintenance fee of 1 cent per linear foot of public right-of-way occupied by the provider's facilities within the metropolitan area. An affiliate of such a provider shall not pay any additional fees to occupy or use the same facilities in public rights-of-way as initially constructed for and used by a cable provider. The fee required under this subsection is in lieu of any other maintenance fee or other fee except for fees paid by the provider under a cable franchise or consent agreement. A cable franchise or consent agreement from a municipality that allows the municipality to seek right-of-way related information comparable to that required by a permit under this act and that provides insurance for right-of-way related activities shall satisfy any requirement for the holder of the cable franchise or consent agreement or its affiliates to obtain a permit to provide information services or telecommunications services in the municipality.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   The cable provider may satisfy the fee requirement under subsection (11) by certifying to the authority that the provider's aggregate investment in this state, since January 1, 1996, in facilities capable of providing broadband internet transport access service exceeds the aggregate amount of the maintenance fees assessed under subsection (11).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   The fees collected under this act shall be used only as provided by this act and shall be subject to an audit by the state auditor general.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(14)   A provider may apply to the commission for a determination of the maximum amount of credit available under section 13b(5) of 1905 PA 282, MCL 207.13b. Each application shall include sufficient documentation to permit the commission to accurately determine the allowable credit. Except as otherwise provided under subsection (15), the commission shall issue its determination within 45 days from the date of the application. Upon certification by the commission of the documentation provided in subdivisions (a) and (b), a provider shall qualify for a credit equal to the costs paid under this act, less the amount of any credit determined under section 13b(1) of 1905 PA 282, MCL 207.13b, and shall not be subject to subsection (16) if the provider files the following documentation under this subsection:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Verification of the costs paid by the provider under this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Verification that the provider's rates and charges for basic local exchange service, including revenues from intrastate subscriber line or end-user line charges, do not exceed the commission's approved rates and charges for those services.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(15)   If the commission finds that it cannot make a determination based on the documentation required under subsection (14), it may require the provider to file its application under section 203 of the Michigan telecommunications act, 1991 PA 179, MCL 484.2203.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(16)   The maximum credit allowed under subsection (14) or (15) shall be the lesser of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The costs paid under this act, less the amount of any credit determined under section 13b(1) of 1905 PA 282, MCL 207.13b.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The amount that the costs paid under this act, together with the provider's total service long run incremental cost of basic local exchange service, exceeds the provider's rates for basic local exchange service plus any additional charges of the provider used to recover its total service long run incremental cost for basic local exchange service. "Total service long run incremental cost" means that term as defined in section 102 of the Michigan telecommunications act, 1991 PA 179, MCL 484.2102.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(17)   The tax credit allowed under subsections (14) and (15) shall be the sole method of recovery for the costs required under this act. A provider shall not recover the costs required under this act through rates and charges to the end-users for telecommunication services.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(18)   An educational institution is not required to pay the fees and charges or fulfill the mapping requirements required under this act for facilities that are constructed and used as provided under applicable provisions of section 307 of the Michigan telecommunications act, 1991 PA 179, MCL 484.2307. To the extent that an educational institution provides services beyond that allowed by section 307 of the Michigan telecommunications act, 1991 PA 179, MCL 484.2307, the educational institution shall obtain a permit, pay the fees and charges, and fulfill the mapping requirement required under this act for each linear foot of public right-of-way used in providing telecommunication services to residential or commercial customers. An educational institution shall notify the commission if it provides telecommunication services beyond that allowed by section 307 of the Michigan telecommunications act, 1991 PA 179, MCL 484.2307, to a residential or commercial customer for compensation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(19)   An electric or gas utility, or an affiliate of a utility, or an electric transmission provider is not required to obtain a permit, pay the fees and charges, or fulfill the mapping requirements required under this act for facilities located in the public rights-of-way that are used solely for electric or gas utility services including internal utility communications and customer services such as billing or load management. The electric or gas utility, or an affiliate of a utility, or an electric transmission provider shall only obtain a permit, pay the fees and charges, and fulfill the mapping requirements required under this act for each linear foot of public right-of-way containing facilities leased or otherwise provided to an unaffiliated telecommunication provider or used in providing telecommunication services to a person other than the utility, or its affiliate, for compensation. An electric or gas utility, or an affiliate of a utility, or an electric transmission provider shall notify the commission if the electric or gas utility, or an affiliate of a utility, or an electric transmission provider provides or leases telecommunication services to a person other than the utility or its affiliate for compensation. For the purposes of this subsection, electric and gas utility services include billing and metering services performed for an alternative electric supplier, an alternative gas supplier, electric utility, electric transmission provider, natural gas utility, or a water utility.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(20)   A state, county, municipality, municipally owned utility, or an affiliate is not required to obtain a permit, pay the fees and charges, or fulfill the mapping requirements required under this act for facilities located in the public rights-of-way that are used solely for state, county, municipality, or governmental entity, or utility services including internal state, county, municipality, governmental entity, or utility communications and customer services such as billing or load management. The state, county, municipality, municipally owned utility, or an affiliate shall only obtain a permit, pay the fees and charges, and fulfill the mapping requirements required under this act for each linear foot of public right-of-way containing facilities leased or otherwise provided to an unaffiliated telecommunication provider or used in providing telecommunication services to a person other than the state, county, another governmental entity, municipality, municipally owned utility, or its affiliate for compensation. A state, county, municipality, municipally owned utility, or an affiliate shall notify the commission if the state, county, municipality, municipally owned utility, or an affiliate provides or leases telecommunication services to a person other than the state, county, another governmental entity, municipality, municipally owned utility, or its affiliate for compensation. For the purposes of this subsection, utility services include billing and metering services performed for an alternative electric supplier, an alternative gas supplier, electric utility, electric transmission provider, natural gas utility, or a water utility.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(21)   The authority may grant to a provider a waiver of the fee requirement of this section for telecommunication facilities located in underserved areas as identified by the authority if 2/3 of the affected municipalities approve the granting of a waiver. If a waiver is granted under this subsection, the amount of the waived fees shall be deducted from the fee revenue the affected municipalities would otherwise be entitled under sections 11 and 12. A waiver granted under this subsection shall not be for more than 10 years. As used in this subsection, "underserved area" means that term as defined under section 7 of the Michigan broadband development authority act.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The legislature finds that certain areas of this state are not being adequately served with broadband services and that, for the benefit of the people of this state and the improvement of their health, welfare, and living conditions, the improvement of the economic and educational welfare of this state, and the improvement of its public safety and security, it is essential that broadband infrastructure be expanded to provide broadband services throughout this state and that the private sector should be encouraged to invest in the deployment of broadband services and networks and that financing by this authority will encourage broadband investment. This act shall provide a method to assure that economic, technological, and logistical integrated broadband services are provided throughout this state on a nondiscriminatory basis. The provision of affordable broadband services and networks will assure the long-term growth of and the enhancement and delivery of services by the educational, medical, commercial, and governmental entities within this state, including, but not limited to, municipalities and counties, public safety facilities, judicial and criminal facilities, telemedical facilities, schools, colleges, universities, hospitals, libraries, community centers, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and residential properties. To increase the speed and availability at which affordable broadband services become available in this state, it is declared to be a valid public purpose to assist in the financing and refinancing of the private and public sectors' development of a statewide broadband infrastructure. It is further declared to be a valid public purpose for the authority created under this act to issue bonds and notes to provide for financing or refinancing to broadband developers and broadband operators, to make loans and provide joint venture and partnership arrangements subject to section 7(2) and (3) to broadband developers and broadband operators, to enter into contracts for the lease or management of all or portions of the broadband infrastructure, and to enter into joint venture and partnership arrangements and partnerships with persons that will acquire, construct, develop, create, maintain, own, and operate all or portions of the broadband infrastructure. The legislature finds that the authority created and powers conferred by this act constitute a necessary program and serve a necessary public purpose.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A franchising entity shall have 30 days after the submission date of a complete franchise agreement to approve the agreement.

At such time as the franchising entity can certify a schedule for at least 8 hours of daily programming for a period of 3 consecutive months, the provider shall restore the previously reallocated channel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The franchising entity shall ensure that all transmissions, content, or programming to be retransmitted by a video service provider is provided in a manner or form that is capable of being accepted and retransmitted by a provider, without requirement for additional alteration or change in the content by the provider, over the particular network of the provider, which is compatible with the technology or protocol utilized by the provider to deliver services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A video service provider may request that an incumbent video provider interconnect with its video system for the sole purpose of providing access to video programming that is being provided over public, education, and government channels for a franchising entity that is served by both providers. Where technically feasible, interconnection shall be allowed under an agreement of the parties. The video service provider and incumbent video provider shall negotiate in good faith and may not unreasonably withhold interconnection.

This section does not apply to a low-power station unless the station is a qualified low-power station as defined under 47 USC 534(h)(2). A provider is required to only carry digital broadcast signals to the extent that a broadcast television station has the right under federal law or regulation to demand carriage of the digital broadcast signals by a cable operator on a cable system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) To facilitate access by subscribers of a video service provider to the signals of local broadcast stations under this section, a station either shall be granted mandatory carriage or may request retransmission consent with the provider.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Delete, change, or alter a copyright identification transmitted as part of a broadcast station's signal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A provider shall not be required to utilize the same or similar reception technology as the broadcast stations or programming providers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A public, education, or government channel shall only be used for noncommercial purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Subsections (7) to (11) apply only to a video service provider that delivers video programming in a video service area where the provider is not regulated as a cable operator under federal law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) If a franchising entity seeks to utilize capacity designated under subsection (1) or an agreement under section 13 to provide access to video programming over 1 or more public, governmental, and education channels, the franchising entity shall give the provider a written request specifying the number of channels in actual use on the incumbent video provider's system or specified in the agreement entered into under section 13.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A video service provider shall not do in connection with the providing of video services to its subscribers and the commission may enforce compliance with any of the following to the extent that the activities are not covered by section 2(3)(l):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Make a statement or representation, including the omission of material information, regarding the rates, terms, or conditions of providing video service that is false, misleading, or deceptive. As used in this subdivision, "material information" includes, but is not limited to, all applicable fees, taxes, and charges that will be billed to the subscriber, regardless of whether the fees, taxes, or charges are authorized by state or federal law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Charge a customer for a subscribed service for which the customer did not make an initial affirmative order. Failure to refuse an offered or proposed subscribed service is not an affirmative order for the service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If a customer has canceled a service, charge the customer for service provided after the effective date the service was canceled.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Cause a probability of confusion or a misunderstanding as to the legal rights, obligations, or remedies of a party to a transaction by making a false, deceptive, or misleading statement or by failing to inform the customer of a material fact, the omission of which is deceptive or misleading.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Represent or imply that the subject of a transaction will be provided promptly, or at a specified time, or within a reasonable time, if the provider knows or has reason to know that it will not be so provided.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Cause coercion and duress as a result of the time and nature of a sales presentation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Each video service provider shall establish a dispute resolution process for its customers. Each provider shall maintain a local or toll-free telephone number for customer service contact.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Each provider shall notify its customers not less than annually of the dispute resolution process created under this section. Each provider shall include the dispute resolution process on its website.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Before a customer can file a complaint with the commission under subsection (5), the customer shall first attempt to resolve the dispute through the dispute resolution process established by the provider under subsection (2). If the dispute cannot be resolved by the provider's dispute resolution process, the customer may file a complaint with the commission under subsection (5). The provider shall provide the customer with the commission's toll-free customer service number and website address.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A complaint filed under this section involving a dispute between a customer and a provider shall be handled by the commission in the following manner:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An attempt to resolve the dispute shall first be made through an informal resolution process. Upon receiving a complaint, the commission shall forward the complaint to the provider and attempt to informally mediate a resolution. The provider shall have 10 business days to respond and offer a resolution. If the dispute cannot be resolved through the informal process, the customer can file a formal complaint under subdivision (b).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A formal complaint filed under this subdivision shall be in writing and shall state the section or sections of this act that the customer alleges the provider has violated, sufficient facts to support the allegations, and the exact relief sought from the provider. The formal complaint shall comply with the same requirements of a written complaint filed under section 203 of the Michigan telecommunications act, 1991 PA 179, MCL 484.2203. The complaint shall be resolved by 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the dispute involves an amount of $5,000.00 or less, the commission shall appoint a mediator within 7 business days of the date the complaint is filed. The mediator shall make recommendations for resolution within 30 days from the date of appointment. Within 10 days of the date of the mediator's recommendations, any named party in the complaint may request a contested case as provided under subparagraph (ii).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the dispute involves an amount greater than $5,000.00, a contested case hearing in the same manner as provided under section 203 of the Michigan telecommunications act, 1991 PA 179, MCL 484.2203.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the dispute is between a provider and a franchising entity or between 2 or more providers, the dispute will be resolved in the following manner:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An attempt to resolve the dispute shall first be made through an informal resolution process. If a provider or franchising entity believes that a violation of this act or the franchising agreement has occurred, the provider or franchising entity may begin an informal complaint process with the commission. The provider or the franchising entity shall file with the commission a written notice of dispute identifying the nature of the dispute, request an informal dispute resolution, and serve the notice of dispute on the other party. Commission staff will conduct an informal mediation in an attempt to resolve the dispute. If a satisfactory resolution to the dispute is not achieved, any named party in the complaint may file a formal complaint under subdivision (b).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A formal complaint to the commission filed under this subdivision shall be in writing and shall state the section or sections of this act or parts of the franchising agreement that the party alleges have been violated, sufficient facts to support the allegations, the relief requested, and shall further contain all information, testimony, exhibits, or other documents and information within the moving party's possession on which the party intends to rely to support the complaint. For a period of 60 days after the date the complaint is filed, the parties shall attempt alternative means of resolving the complaint. If the parties cannot agree on the alternative means within 10 days after the date the complaint is filed, the commission shall order mediation. Within 60 days from the date mediation is ordered, the mediator shall issue a recommended settlement. Within 7 days after the date the recommended settlement is issued, each party shall file with the commission a written acceptance or rejection of the recommended settlement. If the parties accept the recommendation, then the recommendation shall become the final order in the contested case. If a party rejects or fails to respond within 7 days to the recommended settlement, then the complaint shall proceed to a contested case hearing in the same manner as provided under section 203 of the Michigan telecommunications act, 1991 PA 179, MCL 484.2203. A party that rejects the recommended settlement shall pay the opposing party's actual costs of proceeding to a contested case hearing, including a reasonable, nonexcessive attorney fee, unless the final order of the commission is more favorable to the rejecting party than the recommended settlement. A final order is considered more favorable if it differs by 10% or more from the recommended settlement in favor of the rejecting party. If the recommendation is not accepted, the individual commissioners shall not be informed of the recommended settlement until they have issued their final order.</div>
