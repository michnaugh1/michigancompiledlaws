<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An owner of a vehicle that is subject to registration under this act shall apply to the secretary of state, on an appropriate form furnished by the secretary of state, for the registration of the vehicle and issuance of a certificate of title for the vehicle. A vehicle brought into this state from another state or jurisdiction that has a rebuilt, salvage, scrap, flood, or comparable certificate of title issued by that other state or jurisdiction must be issued a rebuilt, salvage, scrap, or flood certificate of title by the secretary of state. The application must be accompanied by the required fee. An application for a certificate of title must bear the signature or verification and certification of the owner. The application must contain all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The owner's name, the owner's bona fide residence, and either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the owner is an individual, the owner's mailing address.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the owner is a firm, association, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, the owner's business address.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A description of the vehicle including the make or name, style of body, and model year; the number of miles, not including the tenths of a mile, registered on the vehicle's odometer at the time of transfer; whether the vehicle is a flood vehicle or another state previously issued the vehicle a flood certificate of title; whether the vehicle is to be or has been used as a taxi or police vehicle, or by a political subdivision of this state, unless the vehicle is owned by a dealer and loaned or leased to a political subdivision of this state for use as a driver education vehicle; whether the vehicle has previously been issued a salvage or rebuilt certificate of title from this state or a comparable certificate of title from any other state or jurisdiction; the vehicle identification number; and the vehicle's weight fully equipped, if a passenger vehicle registered in accordance with section 801(1)(a), and, if a trailer coach or pickup camper, in addition to the weight, the manufacturer's serial number, or in the absence of the serial number, a number assigned by the secretary of state. A number assigned by the secretary of state must be permanently placed on the trailer coach or pickup camper in the manner and place designated by the secretary of state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A statement of the applicant's title and the names and addresses of the holders of security interests in the vehicle and in an accessory to the vehicle, in the order of their priority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Further information that the secretary of state reasonably requires to enable the secretary of state to determine whether the vehicle is lawfully entitled to registration and the owner entitled to a certificate of title. If the secretary of state is not satisfied as to the ownership of a vehicle having a value over $2,500.00 or that is less than 10 years old, before registering the vehicle and issuing a certificate of title, the secretary of state may require the applicant to file a properly executed surety bond in a form prescribed by the secretary of state and executed by the applicant and a company authorized to conduct a surety business in this state. The bond must be in an amount equal to twice the value of the vehicle as determined by the secretary of state and must be conditioned to indemnify or reimburse the secretary of state, any prior owner, and any subsequent purchaser or lessee of the vehicle and their successors in interest against any expense, loss, or damage, including reasonable attorney fees, because of the issuance of a certificate of title for the vehicle or on account of any defect in the right, title, or interest of the applicant in the vehicle. An interested person has a right of action to recover on the bond for a breach of the conditions of the bond, but the aggregate liability of the surety to all persons must not exceed the amount of the bond. If the secretary of state is not satisfied as to the ownership of a vehicle that is valued at $2,500.00 or less and that is 10 years old or older, the secretary of state shall require the applicant to certify that the applicant is the owner of the vehicle and entitled to register and title the vehicle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Except as provided in subdivision (f), an application for a commercial vehicle must also have attached a scale weight receipt of the motor vehicle fully equipped as of the time the application is made. A scale weight receipt is not necessary if there is presented with the application a registration receipt of the previous year that shows on its face the empty weight of the motor vehicle as registered with the secretary of state that is accompanied by a statement of the applicant that there has not been structural change in the motor vehicle that has increased the empty weight and that the previous registered weight is the true weight.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) An application for registration of a vehicle on the basis of elected gross weight must include a declaration by the applicant specifying the elected gross weight for which application is being made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) If the application is for a certificate of title of a motor vehicle registered in accordance with section 801(1)(p), the application must include the manufacturer's suggested base list price for the model year of the vehicle. The base list price must be the manufacturer's suggested retail price as shown on the label required to be affixed to the vehicle under 15 USC 1232. If the manufacturer's suggested retail price is unavailable, the application must list the purchase price of the vehicle. As used in this subdivision, "purchase price" means that term as defined in section 801.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An applicant for registration of a leased pickup truck or passenger vehicle that is subject to registration under this act, except a vehicle that is subject to a registration fee under section 801g, shall disclose in writing to the secretary of state the lessee's name, the lessee's bona fide residence, and either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the lessee is an individual, the lessee's Michigan driver license number or Michigan personal identification number or, if the lessee does not have a Michigan driver license or Michigan personal identification number, the lessee's mailing address.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the lessee is a firm, association, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, the lessee's business address.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The secretary of state shall maintain the information described in subsection (2) on the secretary of state's computer records.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as provided in subsections (5), (11), and (12), a dealer selling, leasing, or exchanging vehicles required to be titled, within 21 days after delivering a vehicle to the purchaser or lessee, and a person engaged in the sale of vessels required to be numbered by part 801 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.80101 to 324.80199, within 21 days after delivering a boat trailer weighing less than 2,500 pounds to the purchaser or lessee, shall apply to the secretary of state for a new title, if required, and transfer or secure registration plates and secure a certificate of registration for the vehicle or boat trailer, in the name of the purchaser or lessee. Subject to subsection (11), the dealer's license may be suspended or revoked in accordance with section 249 for failure to apply for a title when required or for failure to transfer or secure registration plates and certificate of registration within the 21 days required by this section. Subject to subsection (11), if the dealer or person fails to apply for a title when required, and to transfer or secure registration plates and secure a certificate of registration and pay the required fees within 21 days of delivery of the vehicle or boat trailer, a title and registration for the vehicle or boat trailer may subsequently be acquired only on the payment of a late transfer fee of $50.00 for an individual or a dealer other than a dealer subject to section 235b in addition to the fees specified in section 806. Subject to subsection (11), for a used or secondhand vehicle dealer subject to section 235b, the late transfer fee is $100.00 in addition to the fees specified in section 806. The purchaser or lessee of the vehicle or the purchaser of the boat trailer shall sign the application, including, if applicable, the declaration specifying the maximum elected gross weight as required by subsection (1)(f), and other necessary papers to enable the dealer or person to secure the title, registration plates, and transfers from the secretary of state. If the secretary of state mails or delivers a purchaser's certificate of title to a dealer, the dealer shall mail or deliver the certificate of title to the purchaser not later than 5 days after receiving the certificate of title from the secretary of state. However, as provided under section 238, the secretary of state is not required to issue a paper title to the owner of a vehicle or lienholder if the title is subject to a security interest, and may issue an electronic title as provided under section 222.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as provided in subsection (12), a dealer selling or exchanging an off lease or buy back vehicle shall apply to the secretary of state for a new title for the vehicle within 21 days after it receives the certificate of title from the lessor or manufacturer under section 235 or section 235b and transfer or secure registration plates and secure a certificate of registration for the vehicle in the name of the purchaser. Subject to subsection (12), the dealer's license may be suspended or revoked in accordance with section 249 for failure to apply for a title when required or for failure to transfer or secure registration plates and certificate of registration within the 21-day period. Subject to subsection (12), if the dealer or person fails to apply for a title when required, and to transfer or secure registration plates and secure a certificate of registration and pay the required fees within the 21-day time period, a title and registration for the vehicle may subsequently be acquired only on the payment of a late transfer fee of $50.00 for an individual or dealer other than a used or secondhand vehicle dealer subject to section 235b in addition to the fees specified in section 806. Subject to subsection (12), the late transfer fee for a used or secondhand vehicle dealer subject to section 235b is $100.00 in addition to the fees specified in section 806. The purchaser of the vehicle shall sign the application, including, if applicable, the declaration specifying the maximum elected gross weight as required by subsection (1)(f), and other necessary papers to enable the dealer or person to secure the title, registration plates, and transfers from the secretary of state. If the secretary of state mails or delivers a purchaser's certificate of title to a dealer, the dealer shall mail or deliver the certificate of title to the purchaser not later than 5 days after receiving the certificate of title from the secretary of state. However, as provided under section 238, the secretary of state is not required to issue a paper title to the owner of a vehicle if the title is subject to a security interest, and may issue an electronic title as provided under section 222.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If a vehicle is delivered to a purchaser or lessee who has valid Michigan registration plates that are to be transferred to the vehicle, and an application for title, if required, and registration for the vehicle is not made before delivery of the vehicle to the purchaser or lessee, the registration plates must be affixed to the vehicle immediately, and the dealer shall provide the purchaser or lessee with an instrument in writing, on a form prescribed by the secretary of state, which serves as a temporary registration for the vehicle for a period of 30 days from the date the vehicle is delivered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the seller does not prepare the credit information, contract note, and mortgage, and the holder, finance company, credit union, or banking institution requires the installment seller to record the lien on the title, the holder, finance company, credit union, or banking institution shall pay the seller a service fee of not more than $10.00. The service fee must be paid from the finance charges and must not be charged to the buyer in addition to the finance charges. The holder, finance company, credit union, or banking institution shall issue its check or bank draft for the principal amount financed, payable jointly to the buyer and seller, and the following must be imprinted on the back side of the check or bank draft:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>"Under Michigan law, the seller must record a first lien in favor of (name of lender) _______________ on the vehicle with vehicle identification number _______________ and title the vehicle only in the name(s) shown on the reverse side."</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) On the front of the check or draft described under subsection (7), the holder, finance company, credit union, or banking institution shall note the name or names of the prospective owners. Failure of the holder, finance company, credit union, or banking institution to comply with these requirements frees the seller from any obligation to record the lien or from any liability that may arise as a result of the failure to record the lien. A service fee must not be charged to the buyer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) In the absence of actual malice proved independently and not inferred from lack of probable cause, a person who in any manner causes a prosecution for larceny of a motor vehicle; for embezzlement of a motor vehicle; for any crime an element of which is the taking of a motor vehicle without authority; or for buying, receiving, possessing, leasing, or aiding in the concealment of a stolen, embezzled, or converted motor vehicle knowing that the motor vehicle has been stolen, embezzled, or converted, is not liable for damages in a civil action for causing the prosecution. This subsection does not relieve a person from proving any other element necessary to sustain the person's cause of action.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Receipt by the secretary of state of a properly tendered application for a certificate of title on which a security interest in a vehicle is to be indicated is a condition of perfection of a security interest in the vehicle and is equivalent to filing a financing statement under the uniform commercial code, 1962 PA 174, MCL 440.1101 to 440.9994, with respect to the vehicle. When a security interest in a vehicle is perfected, it has priority over the rights of a lien creditor as that term is defined in section 9102 of the uniform commercial code, 1962 PA 174, MCL 440.9102.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Notwithstanding subsection (4), a dealer selling, leasing, or exchanging vehicles, required to be titled, after March 31, 2021 but before August 1, 2021, may apply to the secretary of state for a new title, if required, and transfer or secure registration plates and secure a certificate of registration for the vehicle in the name of the purchaser within 30 days. Both of the following apply to a dealer that complies with this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The dealer's license must not be suspended or revoked in accordance with section 249 for failure to apply for a title when required or for failure to transfer or secure registration plates and certificate of registration within the 21-day period required under subsection (4).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The secretary of state shall not charge any applicable late fees required under subsection (4) and shall, on the dealer's request, reimburse a late fee charged and collected after March 31, 2021 to the end of the period described under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Notwithstanding subsection (5), a dealer selling or exchanging an off lease or buy back vehicle after March 31, 2021 but before August 1, 2021 may apply to the secretary of state for a new title for the vehicle within 30 days after the dealer receives the certificate of title from the lessor or manufacturer under section 235 or 235b and transfer or secure registration plates and secure a certificate of registration for the vehicle in the name of the purchaser. Both of the following apply to a dealer that complies with this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The dealer's license must not be suspended or revoked in accordance with section 249 for failure to apply for a title when required or for failure to transfer or secure registration plates and certificate of registration within the 21-day period required under subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The secretary of state shall not charge any applicable late fees required under subsection (5) and shall, on the dealer's request, reimburse a late fee charged and collected after March 31, 2021 to the end of the period described under this subsection.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The secretary of state may conduct periodic reviews of the records of a dealer to determine whether adequate notice is given to a transferee or lessee of a rebuilt salvage vehicle of that vehicle's prior designation as a salvage vehicle. The secretary of state may request an insurance company to provide copies of salvage title documents and claims reports involving major component parts to assist the secretary of state in monitoring compliance with this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except for a late model vehicle that has been stolen and recovered and that has no major component part removed, missing, or destroyed, or damaged and not salvageable, an insurance company licensed to conduct business in this state that acquires ownership of a late model vehicle through the payment of a claim shall proceed under either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the insurance company acquires ownership of the vehicle through payment of a claim, the owner of the vehicle must assign the certificate of title to the insurance company which shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Surrender a properly assigned certificate of title to the secretary of state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If the estimated cost of repair, including parts and labor, is equal to or more than 75% but less than 91% of the predamaged actual cash value of the vehicle, apply for a salvage certificate of title, and if the estimated cost of repair, including parts and labor, is equal to or greater than 91% of the predamaged actual cash value of the vehicle, apply for a scrap certificate of title. The insurance company shall not sell the vehicle without first receiving a salvage or scrap certificate of title, which shall be assigned to the buyer. An insurance company may assign a salvage or scrap certificate of the title only to an automotive recycler, used or secondhand vehicle parts dealer, foreign salvage vehicle dealer, or vehicle scrap metal processor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If after payment of a total loss claim the insurance company permits the owner of the vehicle to retain ownership, the insurance company shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the estimated cost of repair, including parts and labor, is equal to or greater than 75% but less than 91% of the predamaged actual cash value of the vehicle, require each owner of the vehicle to sign an application for a salvage certificate of title, or if the estimated cost of repair, including parts and labor, is equal to or greater than 91% of the predamaged actual cash value of the vehicle, require each owner of the vehicle to sign an application for a scrap vehicle certificate of title.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Attach the owner's certificate of title to the application for a salvage or scrap certificate of title or have the owner certify that the certificate of title is lost.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) On behalf of the owner, apply to the secretary of state for a salvage or scrap certificate of title in the name of the owner. The owner shall not sell or otherwise dispose of the vehicle without first receiving a salvage or scrap certificate of title, which must be assigned to the buyer. An insurance company may assign a salvage or scrap certificate of title only to an automotive recycler, used or secondhand vehicle parts dealer, foreign salvage vehicle dealer, or vehicle scrap metal processor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If an insurance company pays a claim for total loss to the owner or lienholder of record as kept by the secretary of state, or both, if applicable, of a vehicle but the owner or lienholder of record as kept by the secretary of state fails to surrender the certificate of title or other document necessary for the transfer of ownership of the vehicle to the insurance company within the expiration of 30 days after the claim payment, the insurance company, without having obtained the surrender of the title or other document otherwise necessary for the transfer of ownership for the vehicle from the owner or lienholder of record as kept by the secretary of state, or both, if applicable, may apply to the secretary of state for a title as provided under this section. The insurance company shall, at the time of application, provide proof of the payment and that the insurance company has requested in writing, by certified mail or by another commercially available delivery service providing proof of delivery, on at least 2 separate occasions that the owner or lienholder of record as kept by the secretary of state surrender to the insurance company the certificate of title or other document necessary for the transfer of ownership to the insurance company. The application must be signed under the penalty of perjury. Subject to subsection (2)(a)(ii), upon meeting the requirements of this subsection, the secretary of state shall issue to the insurance company the appropriate certificate of title free of all liens. Proof of payment of the claim is satisfied only by 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) In the case of payment by check, either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A copy of the front and back of the endorsed check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Evidence that the check has cleared the account of the payer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) In the case of payment by electronic transfer, evidence that the payment was charged to the account of the payer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as provided in subsection (3), if an insurance company acquires ownership of a vehicle other than a late model vehicle through payment of damages due to an accident, the company shall surrender a properly assigned title to the buyer upon delivery.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a dealer acquires ownership of a late model vehicle that is a distressed vehicle from an owner, the dealer shall receive an assigned certificate of title. If the assigned certificate of title is not a salvage or scrap certificate of title, the dealer, other than a vehicle scrap metal processor, shall surrender the assigned certificate of title to the secretary of state, and if the estimated cost of repair, including parts and labor, is equal to or greater than 75% but less than 91% of the predamaged actual cash value of the vehicle, apply for a salvage certificate of title, or if the estimated cost of repair, including parts and labor, is equal to or greater than 91% of the predamaged actual cash value of the vehicle, apply for a scrap certificate of title within 5 days after the dealer receives the assigned certificate of title. The dealer may sell a salvage vehicle to another automotive recycler, used or secondhand vehicle parts dealer, foreign salvage vehicle dealer, or vehicle scrap metal processor by assigning the salvage certificate of title to the buyer. Unless the vehicle is rebuilt, inspected, and recertified under this section, if the vehicle is sold to a buyer other than a dealer, application must be made for a salvage certificate in the name of the buyer in the manner provided in this act. The dealer may sell a scrap vehicle only to a vehicle scrap metal processor.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Further information as may reasonably be required by the secretary of state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The scrap certificate of title must authorize the holder of the document to transport but not drive on a highway the vehicle or parts of a vehicle, and assign ownership to a vehicle scrap metal processor, automotive recycler, used or secondhand vehicle parts dealer, or foreign salvage vehicle dealer. A certificate of title must not again be issued for this vehicle. A person shall not rebuild or repair a scrap vehicle and allow it to retain the original vehicle identification number.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a person, other than a dealer or insurance company that is subject to subsection (2) or (5), acquires ownership of a distressed, late model vehicle, the person must surrender the title or assigned certificate of title to the secretary of state, and if the estimated cost of repair, including parts and labor, is equal to or greater than 75% but less than 91% of the predamaged actual cash value of the vehicle, apply for a salvage certificate of title, or if the estimated cost of repair, including parts and labor, is equal to or greater than 91% of the predamaged actual cash value of the vehicle, apply for a scrap certificate of title before the vehicle may be transported.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An owner of a vehicle may determine that a vehicle is a scrap vehicle or a salvage vehicle without making any determination as to the actual cash value of the vehicle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If a leasing company, vehicle manufacturer, insurance company not licensed to do business in this state, association, repossession company, self-insured owner, financial institution, governmental entity, or other company, institution, or entity, owns a distressed, late model vehicle, the titleholder shall surrender the title or assigned certificate of title to the secretary of state and apply for a salvage certificate of title if the retail cost of repair, including parts and labor, is equal to or greater than 75% but less than 91% of the predamaged actual cash value of the vehicle, or if the retail cost of repair, including parts and labor, is equal to or greater than 91% of the predamaged actual cash value of the vehicle, apply for a scrap certificate of title, before the vehicle may be transported or sold. If ownership is transferred, the owner must sell the vehicle only to a dealer that is eligible to buy a salvage or scrap vehicle in this state unless the owner complies with subsection (13). When a leasing company, vehicle manufacturer, insurance company not licensed to do business in this state, association, repossession company, self-insured owner, financial institution, governmental entity, or other company, institution, or entity, estimates the repair of a distressed, late model vehicle for the purpose of determining whether to apply for a salvage or scrap certificate of title, a complete record of the estimate and, if the vehicle is repaired before a transfer of ownership, a complete record of the actual cost of the repairs performed and who performed the repairs must be maintained for a minimum of 5 years by the leasing company, vehicle manufacturer, insurance company not licensed to do business in this state, association, repossession company, self-insured owner, financial institution, governmental entity, or other company, institution, or entity.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) After the October 1 immediately preceding the year designated on the registration, issue a registration upon application and payment of the proper fee for a commercial vehicle, other than a pickup or van owned by an individual; or a trailer owned by a business, corporation, or person other than an individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Beginning 60 days before the expiration date assigned on an international registration plan registration plate, issue a registration under section 801g upon application and payment of the proper apportioned fee for a commercial vehicle engaged in interstate commerce.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Beginning 45 days before the owner's birthday or, if the owner has requested the expiration date described in subsection (14), 45 days before the expiration date, and 120 days before the expiration date assigned by the secretary of state, issue a registration for a vehicle other than those designated in subsection (1)(a) or (b). However, if an owner whose registration period begins 45 days before the owner's birthday or expiration date will be out of the state during the 45 days immediately preceding expiration of a registration or for other good cause shown cannot apply for a renewal registration within the 45-day period, application for a renewal registration may be made not more than 6 months before expiration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and subsection (14), the secretary of state, upon application and payment of the proper fee, shall issue a registration for a vehicle or a motorcycle to a resident that expires on the owner's birthday or, if applicable, on the expiration date described in subsection (14). If the owner's next birthday is at least 6 months but not more than 12 months in the future, the owner shall receive a registration valid until the owner's next birthday or, if applicable, the expiration date described in subsection (14). If the owner's next birthday is less than 6 months in the future, the owner shall receive a registration valid until the owner's birthday following the owner's next birthday or, if applicable, the expiration date described in subsection (14). The tax required under this act for a registration described in this subsection is either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For an original registration, the tax must bear the same relationship to the tax required under section 801 for a 12-month registration as the length of the registration bears to 12 months.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For a renewal of a registration, either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) For a registration that is for at least 6 months but not more than 12 months, the same amount as for 12 months.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) For a renewal of a registration that is for more than 12 months, 2 times the amount for 12 months.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Partial months must be considered as whole months in the calculation of the required tax and in the determination of the length of time between the application for a registration and the owner's next birthday or, if applicable, the expiration date described in subsection (14). The tax required for that registration must be rounded off to whole dollars as provided in section 801.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A certificate of title remains valid until canceled by the secretary of state for cause or upon a transfer of an interest shown on the certificate of title.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The secretary of state, upon request, shall issue special registration for commercial vehicles, valid for 6 months after the date of issue, if the full registration fee exceeds $50.00, on the payment of 1/2 the full registration fee and a service charge as enumerated in section 802(1).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A special registration issued under subsection (9) is valid for not more than 60 days after the date of issuance, and a fee must be collected for each special registration as provided in section 802(3). The special registration may be in the form determined by the secretary of state. If a dealer makes a retail sale or lease of a vehicle to a purchaser or lessee who is qualified and eligible to obtain a special registration, the dealer shall apply for the special registration for the purchaser or lessee. If a person other than a dealer sells or leases a vehicle to a purchaser or lessee who is qualified and eligible to obtain a special registration, the purchaser or lessee shall appear in person, or by a person exercising the purchaser's or lessee's power of attorney, at an office of the secretary of state and furnish a certification that the person is the bona fide purchaser or lessee or that the person has granted the power of attorney, together with other forms required for the issuance of the special registration and provide the secretary of state with proof that the vehicle is covered by an automobile insurance policy issued under section 3101 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.3101, or proof that the vehicle is covered by a policy of insurance issued by an insurer under section 3163 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.3163.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Other information requested by the secretary of state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) In the case of a commercial vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer issued a registration under the international registration plan, the secretary of state in mutual agreement with the owner may assign or reassign the expiration date of the registration. However, the expiration date agreed to must be either March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31 or beginning on February 19, 2019, the last day of a calendar month.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The secretary of state may issue a registration plate upon application and payment of the proper fee to an individual, partnership, corporation, or association who in the ordinary course of business has occasion to legally repossess a vehicle in which a security interest is held. A registration plate issued under this subsection must be used to move and dispose of a vehicle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The secretary of state may issue a registration plate upon application and payment of the proper fee to an individual, partnership, corporation, or association that in the ordinary course of business has occasion to legally pick up or deliver a vehicle not required to be titled under this act, to legally pick up or deliver a commercial motor vehicle being driven to a facility to undergo aftermarket modification, or to repair or service a vehicle, or to a dealer as defined in section 80102 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.80102 to deliver a vessel or trailer to a customer or to and from a boat show or exposition.

In determining the format under this subsection, the secretary of state shall consult with insurers. The transmission to the secretary of state of the vehicle policy information is proof of insurance to the secretary of state for motor vehicle registration purposes only and is not evidence that a policy of insurance actually exists between an insurer and an individual.

This subsection does not prohibit the service, repair, or replacement of an odometer if the mileage indicated on the odometer remains the same as before the service, repair, or replacement. If the odometer is incapable of registering the same mileage as before the service, repair, or replacement, the odometer must be adjusted to read zero and a notice in writing must be attached to the left door frame of the vehicle by the owner or the owner's agent specifying the mileage prior to service, repair, or replacement of the odometer and the date on which it was serviced, repaired, or replaced.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If the lessor transfers a leased vehicle without obtaining possession of the vehicle, the lessor may indicate on the certificate of title the mileage disclosed by the lessee under subsection (9), unless the lessor has reason to believe that the mileage disclosed by the lessee does not reflect the actual mileage of the vehicle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A dealer that is required by this section to execute an odometer mileage statement shall retain for 5 years a photostatic, carbon, or other facsimile copy of each odometer mileage statement the dealer issues or receives. The dealer shall retain the odometer mileage statements at the dealer's primary place of business in an order that is appropriate to business requirements and that permits systematic retrieval.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A lessor shall retain, for 5 years following the date of transfer of ownership of each leased vehicle, the odometer mileage statement received from the lessee. The lessor shall retain the odometer mileage statements at the lessor's primary place of business in an order that is appropriate to business requirements and that permits systematic retrieval.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) For the purposes of this section, the department may accept an electronically signed odometer disclosure document that complies with all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Is submitted on a form that is approved by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Is electronically signed using software that provides antitamper and identification verification technology and is approved for this use by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Is otherwise fully compliant with 49 CFR part 580.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) The department may establish, implement, and operate an electronic system to process the notification and transfer of a vehicle ownership interest between private parties through an electronic transfer instead of the collection of paper documents otherwise required under this act. If the electronic system is established, a private party that uses the electronic system shall comply with any requirement of this section that the department determines is necessary and provide any information that is required by the department. The department may enter into 1 or more contracts to establish, implement, and operate the electronic system under this subsection. The contract must require the protection of proprietary information contained in the electronic system and other information as protected under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) As used in this section, "private parties" means that both a vehicle's buyer and seller are not a dealer.</div>

Upon proper petition, the secretary of state shall provide the applicant with a certificate of title for that vehicle or vehicles, if the total value of the vehicle or vehicles, based on the date of the presented title transfer application, does not exceed the following dollar amount, as applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For calendar years through 2023, $60,000.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For the 2024 and 2025 calendar years, $100,000.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For the 2026 calendar year and each calendar year thereafter, a dollar amount equal to the product of the dollar amount applicable to the immediately preceding calendar year multiplied by the cost-of-living adjustment factor, rounded to the nearest $1,000.00. Beginning with the dollar amount for the 2026 calendar year and annually thereafter, the department of treasury shall certify and publish the dollar amount applicable for each calendar year no later than September 1 of the prior calendar year.</div>

<P>Sec. 236a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the interest of the owner in a vehicle is terminated by the enforcement of a security agreement, the transferee of the owner's interest shall promptly mail or deliver to the secretary of state the last certificate of title if the transferee has possession of the certificate; the application for a new certificate in the form prescribed by the secretary of state; and a certification made by or on behalf of the holder of the security interest so enforced that the vehicle was repossessed, that the interest of the owner was lawfully terminated by enforcement of the security agreement, and whether the owner has delivered the last certificate of title to the transferee of the owner's interest, naming the transferee, or if not, the reason for not naming the transferee, and the location of the certificate of title as known to the owner. If the holder of the security interest succeeds to the interest of the owner and holds the vehicle for resale, the holder need not secure a new certificate of title but, upon transfer to another person, shall promptly mail or deliver to the transferee or to the secretary of state the certificate, if in the holder's possession, a certification, and other documents required to be sent to the secretary of state by the transferee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the interest of the owner in a vehicle is terminated by sale pursuant to a levy of execution, attachment, or by other process of a court, the transferee of the owner's interest shall promptly mail or deliver to the secretary of state the last certificate of title, if the transferee has possession of the certificate, the application for a new certificate of title in the form prescribed by the secretary of state, and a certification upon a form prescribed by the secretary of state, made by the officer of the court who conducted the sale, setting forth the date of the sale, the name of the purchaser, and whether the officer of the court has delivered the certificate of title to the purchaser and if not, the reason for nondelivery and the location of the certificate of title so far as known to the officer of the court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A person holding a certificate of title in which the interest of the owner named on the certificate has been terminated in the manner provided by subsection (1) or (2), shall mail or deliver the certificate to the secretary of state upon request. The delivery of the certificate pursuant to the request of the secretary of state does not affect the rights of the person surrendering the certificate, and the action of the secretary of state in issuing a new certificate of title as provided in this act is not conclusive upon the rights of an owner or holder of a security interest named in the old certificate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The secretary of state, upon receipt of an application for a new certificate of title by a transferee in the manner provided by subsection (1) or (2), with proof of the transfer, the required fee, and other documents required by law, shall issue a new certificate of title in the name of the transferee as owner, setting forth all security interests noted on the last certificate of title as having priority over the security agreement so enforced and shall mail or deliver the certificate to the owner. If the outstanding certificate of title is not delivered to the secretary of state, the secretary of state shall make demand for the outstanding certificate of title from the holder.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) When an owner named in a certificate of title creates a security interest in the vehicle described in the certificate or in any accessory on the vehicle, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The owner shall immediately execute an application in the form prescribed by the department to name the holder of the security interest on the certificate of title, showing the name and address of the holder and deliver the certificate of title, application and the required fee together with a copy of the application, to the holder of the security interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The holder of the security interest shall cause the certificate of title, application and fee and the copy of the application to be mailed or delivered to the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The department shall indicate on the copy of the application the date and place of filing of the application. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Upon receipt of the certificate of title, application and the required fee, the department shall issue a new certificate in the form provided by section 222 setting forth the name and address of each holder of a security interest in the vehicle or in any accessory on the vehicle for which a termination statement has not been filed and the date on which the application first stating the security interest was filed, and mail the certificate to the owner. However, as provided under this section, the secretary of state is not required to issue a title to the owner of a vehicle if the title is subject to a security interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A holder of any kind of a security interest may assign, absolutely or otherwise, the holder's security interest in the vehicle or any accessory thereon to a person other than the owner without affecting the interest of the owner or the validity of the security interest, but any person without notice of the assignment is protected in dealing with the holder of the security interest as the holder thereof.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The assignee of a security interest may have the certificate of title indorsed with the assignee named as the holder of the security interest by providing the department with a copy of the assignment instrument, but the failure of the assignee to do so shall not affect the validity of the security interest of that assignment. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If there is no outstanding obligation and no commitment to make advances, incur obligations, or otherwise give value secured or to be secured by a security interest in a vehicle or an accessory on the vehicle, for which the certificate of title is in possession of a secured party, the secured party may, not more than 14 days after satisfaction of the obligation, execute a termination statement in the form prescribed by the department and mail or deliver the termination statement to the owner or another person as the owner may direct. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If there is no outstanding obligation and no commitment to make advances, incur obligations, or otherwise give value secured or to be secured by a security interest in a vehicle or an accessory on the vehicle, for which the certificate of title is in the possession of another person, the secured party shall, within 14 days after demand but not more than 30 days after demand, execute a termination statement in the form prescribed by the department and mail or deliver the termination statement to the owner or another person as the owner may direct.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The department may require that all transactions concerning vehicle title liens and security interests be conducted by electronic means, as determined by the department. After all liens have been terminated, or for purposes of retitling the vehicle in another state or any other purpose deemed appropriate by the department, the department may issue a paper copy of the vehicle title to the vehicle's owner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A vehicle sale transaction in which a security interest is entered by electronic means shall include a document recording entry of the electronic security interest and information regarding the financial institution that holds the security interest. At the time a security interest is presented with payment in satisfaction of the security interest, a secured receipt in a form approved by the department and produced at the time the security interest is presented with payment in satisfaction of the security interest may be submitted to the department in lieu of the title for purposes of transferring ownership in the vehicle.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A dealer shall make a separate application for each agent license and forward the application to the secretary of state along with the application of the dealer for a dealer license. A fee of $50.00 shall accompany each application for an agent license. The license of an agent issues, renews, and expires with the issuance, renewal, and expiration of the license of a dealer. If necessary, a dealer may apply for the license for an agent at any time during the time period that the dealer license is valid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A license for an agent shall not be granted until an investigation is made of the agent's qualifications under this act, except that this subsection does not apply to license renewals. The secretary of state shall make the investigation within 15 days after receiving the application and make a report on the investigation.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The secretary of state shall maintain a copy or a negative of the photograph for purposes of renewing or issuing duplicate salvage vehicle agent licenses.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A dealer shall immediately notify the secretary of state in writing if there is any factual or material change in the information stated in an agent's license or application for the license.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   A dealer may cancel the license of an agent at any time. If a dealer cancels the license of an agent, the dealer shall notify, in writing, the secretary of state within 5 days of the cancellation and forward the canceled license to the secretary of state along with this notice. The dealer shall advise each salvage pool or salvage auction where the dealer does business of the cancellation. An agent's license is automatically canceled, by operation of law, at the end of the employment of the agent by the dealer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   Within 5 days of the cancellation, expiration, suspension, or revocation of the license of an agent, the agent shall surrender the license to the dealer or secretary of state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   If an agent's license becomes lost, mutilated, or illegible, the dealer shall promptly apply to the secretary of state for the issuance of a duplicate license. Application shall be made on a form as prescribed by the secretary of state and be accompanied by a fee of $50.00 and the mutilated or illegible license.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   A dealer shall indemnify the secretary of state and any member of the public who suffers or sustains any loss by reason of any violation of this act by an agent that occurs within the actual or apparent scope of the agent's authority during the period that the agent's license is valid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   An agent required to be licensed under this section, as a condition precedent to the granting of a license, shall file with the secretary of state an irrevocable written stipulation, authenticated by the agent applicant, stipulating and agreeing that legal process affecting the agent, served on the secretary of state or a deputy of the secretary of state, has the same effect as if personally served on the agent.

</P>
<P>Sec. 248j.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In addition to any other remedies provided by law, if the secretary of state determines that a person has acted as a dealer without a dealer license, he or she may issue the person a verbal or written warning or assess an administrative fine of not more than $5,000.00 for a first violation, and not more than $7,500.00 for each subsequent violation occurring within 7 years of a prior violation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the secretary of state assesses an administrative fine under subsection (1), the secretary of state shall provide notice of the assessment in writing pursuant to section 212. At a minimum, the notice of assessment shall contain all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A unique identification number.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A description of the alleged violation that is the basis for the assessment, including the date the alleged violation occurred and a reference to the specific section or rule alleged to have been violated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The administrative fine established for the violation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A statement indicating that if the fine is not paid, the secretary of state may refer the fine to the department of treasury for collection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   A statement indicating that if the alleged violation is contested, the person has a right to request an informal conference before an administrative hearing, accompanied by simple instructions informing the person how to request or waive the informal conference.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Not later than 20 days after receiving the written notice of assessment, the alleged violator shall do 1 of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Pay the administrative fine to the secretary of state. A payment waives the person's right to an informal conference and an administrative hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Request the secretary of state to conduct an informal conference.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Waive the right to an informal conference and request the secretary of state to conduct an administrative hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   If the person is not a licensed dealer, pay the administrative fine to the secretary of state and submit a properly completed dealer license application to the secretary of state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A person's request for an informal conference or an administrative hearing shall comply with all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Be in writing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Be postmarked or received by the department within 20 days after the date the person received the written notice of assessment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   State the name, address, and telephone number of the person requesting the informal conference or administrative hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   State the written notice of assessment's unique identification number.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   State the reason for the request.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   If the request is for an administrative hearing without an informal conference, state the person is waiving his or her right to an informal conference.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If the secretary of state receives a request for an informal conference or an administrative hearing that meets all of the conditions prescribed in subsection (4), the secretary of state shall schedule an informal conference or an administrative hearing, as applicable. If the request fails to meet all of the conditions prescribed in subsection (4), the secretary of state may in writing deny the request. A denial shall be served on the person by first-class mail and shall do both of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   State the reason for the denial.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Grant the person 14 days to submit a valid request to the secretary of state.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The secretary of state shall conduct an informal conference under this section within 45 days after receiving a valid request for the conference. The secretary of state shall serve upon the alleged violator, by first-class mail not less than 5 days before the conference, a written notice that includes time, place, and date of the informal conference. The notice shall state that the alleged violator may be represented by an attorney at the informal conference.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   After the informal conference, the secretary of state shall evaluate the validity of the assessment of the administrative fine and affirm, modify, or dismiss the assessment. In making the evaluation, the secretary of state may consider 1 or more of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Whether there is reason to believe the alleged violation did in fact occur.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The severity of the alleged violation and its impact on the public.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The number of prior or related violations by the person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The likelihood of future compliance by the person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Any other considerations the secretary of state considers appropriate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Within 20 days after conducting the informal conference, the secretary of state shall serve upon the person by first-class mail a written statement describing whether the assessment of the administrative fine is affirmed, modified, or dismissed and the basis of the action. If the assessment is affirmed or modified, this statement shall also advise the person that he or she will receive a notice of hearing where the validity of the assessment may be contested or he or she may immediately pay the fine to the secretary of state and that payment of the fine will prevent scheduling of an administrative hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   A notice of hearing under this section shall be served on the person by first-class mail not less than 5 days before the date scheduled for the administrative hearing and, at a minimum, advise the person of all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The time, place, and date of hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   That an impartial hearing officer will conduct the hearing and allow the person an opportunity to examine the secretary of state's evidence and present evidence in person or in writing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   That the person has a right to be represented by an attorney at the administrative hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The common reasons why the secretary of state could dismiss an assessment of an administrative fine.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   That the hearing officer conducting the administrative hearing will be authorized to do all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   Affirm, modify, or dismiss the assessment of an administrative fine.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Correct any errors in the department's records that relate directly to the assessment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   Refer or not refer the fine to the department of treasury for collection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)   Take or order any other action or resolution considered appropriate by the hearing officer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   That if the department of treasury takes enforcement action against the person, he or she may seek a review in the court of claims.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   The secretary of state shall conduct an administrative hearing under this section pursuant to the contested case provisions of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328. If an administrative fine assessed under this section is affirmed by the decision of the hearing officer, the hearing officer may assess the person costs of not more than $500.00, to reimburse the secretary of state for proving the validity of the alleged violation, in addition to any other penalties, sanctions, or costs imposed as provided by law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   An administrative fine assessed under this section becomes final upon the first to occur of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The secretary of state does not receive a valid request for an informal conference or an administrative hearing within the time period described in subsection (4).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Twenty days after a person waives his or her right to an administrative hearing.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   An administrative hearing decision is served upon the person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   After a person pays the secretary of state the fine imposed, the secretary of state shall forward the money to the department of treasury for deposit in a separate fund within the general fund. Upon appropriation, this money shall be used first to defray the expense of the secretary of state in administering this chapter.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   If an administrative fine assessed under this section is not paid within 60 days after it becomes final, the secretary of state may refer the matter to the department of treasury for collection as a state debt through the offset of state tax refunds and may use the services of the department of treasury to levy the salary, wages, or other income or assets of the person as provided by law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(14)   Payment of an administrative fine assessed under this section does not constitute an admission of responsibility or guilt by the person. Payment of an administrative fine assessed under this section does not prevent the secretary of state from charging a violation described in the assessment of the administrative fine in a subsequent or concurrent contested case proceeding conducted by the secretary of state pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(15)   If the person submits a properly completed application and appropriate fee for a dealer license within 20 days after an administrative fine under subsection (1) is assessed, and if the secretary of state issues the person a dealer license within 45 days of receiving the properly completed application and fee, the secretary of state shall reduce the amount of the administrative fine by 50%.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(16)   The secretary of state shall serve a notice, denial, decision, or statement under this section in compliance with section 212.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(17)   An informal conference under this section is not a compliance conference under section 92 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.292.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Each record must contain the date of the purchase, sale, lease, or exchange or receipt for the purpose of sale, lease, or exchange, a description of the vehicle, the name and address of the seller, the purchaser or lessee, and the alleged owner or other persons from whom the vehicle was purchased or received, or to whom it was sold, leased, or delivered.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The owner may contest the fact that the vehicle is considered abandoned or the reasonableness of the towing fees and daily storage fees by requesting a hearing and posting a bond equal to $40.00 plus the amount of the accrued towing and storage fees.

If the owner is in default on a contract or agreement with the secured party regarding that vehicle, the court shall dismiss the owner's petition and proceed with the secured party's petition in the same manner as provided in subsection (6). If the secured party redeems the vehicle, the owner may only seek damages related to the reasonableness of the towing fees and daily storage fees from the secured party. If the court finds, after a hearing on the reasonableness of the towing fees and daily storage fees, that the owner's or the secured party's challenge was frivolous, the court may award reasonable attorney fees to the custodian of the vehicle.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Before removing the vehicle from private property, the towing agency shall provide notice by telephone, or otherwise, to a police agency having jurisdiction over the vehicle that the vehicle is being removed. Within 24 hours after receipt of the notice from the towing agency, the police agency shall determine if the vehicle has been reported stolen and enter the vehicle into the law enforcement information network as an abandoned vehicle. Verification by the police agency of compliance with this section is not necessary and is not a predicate to the entrance of the vehicle into the law enforcement information network.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Within 24 hours after taking the abandoned vehicle into custody, the police agency shall notify the secretary of state through the law enforcement information network that the vehicle has been taken into custody as abandoned.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a person shall not operate, nor shall an owner knowingly permit to be operated, upon any highway, a vehicle required to be registered under this act unless, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no later than 30 days after the vehicle is registered or the vehicle's registration is renewed, a valid registration plate issued for the vehicle by the department for the current registration year is attached to and displayed on the vehicle as required by this chapter. For purposes of this subsection, a printed or electronic copy of a valid registration or verification of a valid registration through the L.E.I.N. is proof that the vehicle is registered or that the vehicle's registration has been renewed. A registration plate is not required for a wrecked or disabled vehicle, or vehicle destined for repair or junking, that is being transported or drawn on a highway by a wrecker or a registered motor vehicle. The 30-day period described in this subsection does not apply to the first registration of a vehicle after a transfer of ownership or to a transfer registration under section 809.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person who violates subsection (1) is responsible for a civil infraction. However, if the vehicle is a commercial vehicle that is required to be registered according to the schedule of elected gross vehicle weights under section 801(1)(k), the person is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 90 days or a fine of not more than $500.00, or both.</div>

In addition, a police officer may impound the vehicle until a valid registration is obtained. If the vehicle is impounded, the towing and storage costs of the vehicle, and the care or preservation of the load in the vehicle are the owner's responsibility. Vehicles impounded are subject to a lien in the amount of the apportioned fee and any fine and costs incurred under this subsection, subject to a valid lien of prior record. If the apportioned fee, fine, and costs are not paid within 90 days after impoundment, then following a hearing before the judge or magistrate who imposed the fine and costs, the judge or magistrate shall certify the unpaid judgment to the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the violation occurred. The prosecuting attorney shall enforce the lien by foreclosure sale in accordance with the procedure authorized by law for chattel mortgage foreclosures.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A noncommercial vehicle registration described in subsection (1) that expires on or after March 1, 2020 but is renewed on or before March 31, 2021 is not in violation of this section. A noncommercial vehicle registration described in subsection (1) that expires after March 31, 2021 but before August 1, 2021, but is renewed within 120 days after the date of the expiration is not in violation of this section.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The secretary of state may cancel, revoke, or suspend the registration of a vehicle, a certificate of title, registration certificate, or registration plate if any of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The secretary of state determines that the registration, certificate of title, or plate was fraudulently or erroneously issued.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The secretary of state determines that the licensee has made or is making an unlawful use of his or her registration certificate, plate, or certificate of title.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A registered vehicle has been dismantled or wrecked.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The secretary of state determines that the required fee has not been paid and it is not paid upon reasonable notice or demand.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A registration certificate or registration plate is knowingly displayed upon a vehicle other than the one for which it was issued.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The secretary of state determines that the owner has committed an offense under this act involving the registration or certificate of title.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The secretary of state is authorized to do so under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Upon receiving notification from another state or foreign country that a certificate of title issued by the secretary of state has been surrendered by the owner in conformity with the laws of that state or foreign country.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) It is shown by satisfactory evidence that delivery of a motor vehicle in the possession of a dealer was not made to the applicant registered under this act. The money paid for registration and license fees may be refunded to the party who applies for the refund.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) The owner is a motor carrier subject to an out-of-service order. As used in this subdivision, "out-of-service order" means that term as defined in 49 CFR 390.5, and also includes an out-of-service order issued under 49 CFR 386.73. A law enforcement officer may also confiscate a registration plate issued to a motor carrier described in this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the licensee's offense consists of hauling on the registered vehicle a gross weight more than 1,000 pounds in excess of the elected gross weight specified on the owners' registration certificate, the registration shall be canceled and the vehicle shall not again be operated on the highways, roads, or streets until it is registered again and new plates are issued. The new registration fee shall be computed on the basis of twice the difference between the original registration fee and the registration fee applicable to the gross weight constituting the violation of the elected gross weight. One-half of the new registration fee shall be a penalty. The period of the new registration fee shall not extend beyond the termination date of the canceled registration certificate. The new registration fee shall not exceed the maximum gross weight of the vehicle or combination of vehicles as determined by the number of axles and the legal weight applicable to those axles as specified by section 722. The gross weight of a vehicle or combination of vehicles may be determined by weighing the individual axles or group of axles, and the total weight on all axles is the gross vehicle weight.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Before the secretary of state makes a cancellation under subsection (1)(a), (b), (e), (f), or (g), the person affected by the cancellation shall be given notice and an opportunity to be heard.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided by this act, and as provided in this section, a nonresident operator of a motor vehicle who is the holder of a license to operate a motor vehicle issued by a country other than the United States is not required to obtain a license to operate a passenger vehicle in this state if he or she does not receive compensation for such operation. The nonresident operator may operate a motor vehicle in compliance with otherwise applicable state and federal law using the license to operate a motor vehicle issued by a country other than the United States if the country that issued the nonresident operator's license is a party to an international treaty, convention, or agreement regulating traffic, driving, or the operation of motor vehicles to which the United States or this state is also a party, according to the terms of that treaty, convention, or agreement. If the issuing country is not a party to a treaty, convention, or agreement described in this subsection, the nonresident operator may operate a motor vehicle using the license issued by his or her home country if he or she would otherwise be able to satisfy the requirements of section 307(1) except for any requirement to establish an address in this state or residency. While operating a passenger vehicle in this state, a nonresident operator who is the holder of a license to operate a motor vehicle issued by a country other than the United States shall have in his or her immediate possession his or her valid license to operate a motor vehicle issued by that country and, if no English translation appears on the front or back of the license, 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A valid international driving permit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the license to operate a motor vehicle is issued by a country that does not permit the issuance of an international driving permit, a document containing a photo and an English translation that substantially corresponds to an international driving permit, which shall be used solely to properly identify the individual appearing on the license for the purpose of enforcing this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The secretary of state shall establish a unique driver record for an individual upon receipt of an abstract of conviction for any offense committed in violation of this act by that individual who is operating a motor vehicle in this state as provided in subsection (1). The operation of a motor vehicle in this state by an individual who possesses a valid license to operate a motor vehicle issued by a country other than the United States is subject to this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) An individual for whom a unique driver record has been created under subsection (2) is subject to all fees, fines, restrictions, and enforcement as if he or she were licensed under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Nothing in this section prohibits the secretary of state from entering into a reciprocal agreement and exchanging letters confirming the extension of privileges to operate vehicles with another country.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The secretary of state shall publish on its website a list of the countries with which it has entered into a reciprocal agreement described in subsection (4).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If the individual has failed to pay any court-ordered fines or costs that resulted from the operation of a vehicle, the restricted license issued under this section must be suspended pending payment of those fines and costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The vehicle of an individual admitted to the specialty court interlock program whose vehicle would otherwise be subject to immobilization or forfeiture under this act is exempt from both immobilization and forfeiture under sections 625n and 904d if both of the following apply:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Before issuing a license, the secretary of state shall examine each applicant for an operator's or chauffeur's license who at the time of the application is not the holder of a valid, unrevoked operator's or chauffeur's license under a law of this state providing for the licensing of drivers. Before the secretary of state authorizes an individual to administer vehicle group designation or endorsement knowledge tests, that individual must successfully complete both a state and Federal Bureau of Investigation fingerprint-based criminal history check or the equivalent through the department of state police. In all other cases, the secretary of state may waive the examination, except that an examination must not be waived if it appears from the application, from the apparent physical or mental condition of the applicant, or from any other information that has come to the secretary of state from another source, that the applicant does not possess the physical, mental, or other qualifications necessary to operate a motor vehicle in a manner as not to jeopardize the safety of persons or property, or that the applicant is not entitled to a license under section 303. A licensee who applies for the renewal of his or her license by mail under section 307 shall certify to his or her physical capability to operate a motor vehicle. The secretary of state may check the applicant's driving record through the National Driver Register and the Commercial Driver's License Information System before issuing a license under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The secretary of state may appoint sheriffs, their deputies, the chiefs of police of cities and villages that have organized police departments within this state, their duly authorized representatives, employees of the secretary of state, or the secretary of state's duly authorized representatives as examining officers for the purpose of examining applicants for operator's and chauffeur's licenses. An examining officer shall conduct examinations of applicants for operator's and chauffeur's licenses in accordance with this chapter and the rules promulgated by the secretary of state under subsection (3). After conducting an examination an examining officer shall make a written report of his or her findings and recommendations to the secretary of state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The secretary of state shall promulgate rules under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, for the examination of the applicant's physical and mental qualifications to operate a motor vehicle in a manner as not to jeopardize the safety of persons or property, and shall ascertain whether facts exist that would bar the issuance of a license under section 303. The secretary of state may consider a written medical report and recommendation submitted under section 5139 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.5139, from the personal physician or optometrist of an applicant, in making the examination regarding the applicant's physical and mental qualifications to operate a motor vehicle under this section and R 257.851 to R 257.855 of the Michigan Administrative Code. A report received by the secretary of state from a physician or an optometrist under this section is confidential. The secretary of state shall also ascertain whether the applicant has sufficient knowledge of the English language to understand highway warnings or direction signs written in that language. The examination must not include investigation of facts other than those facts directly pertaining to the ability of the applicant to operate a motor vehicle with safety or facts declared to be prerequisite to the issuance of a license under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The secretary of state shall not issue an original operator's or chauffeur's license without a vehicle group designation or indorsement without an examination that includes a driving skills test conducted by the secretary of state or by a designated examining officer under subsection (2) or section 310e. The secretary of state may enter into an agreement with another public or private corporation or agency to conduct a driving skills test conducted under this section. Before the secretary of state authorizes an individual to administer a corporation's or agency's driver skills testing operations or authorizes an examiner to conduct a driving skills test, that individual or examiner must successfully complete both a state and Federal Bureau of Investigation fingerprint-based criminal history check through the department of state police as required by law and as provided under 49 CFR 384.228. In an agreement with another public or private corporation or agency to conduct a driving skills test, the secretary of state shall prescribe the method and examination criteria to be followed by the corporation, agency, or examiner when conducting the driving skills test and the form of the certification to be issued to an individual who satisfactorily completes a driving skills test. An original vehicle group designation or indorsement must not be issued by the secretary of state without a knowledge test conducted by the secretary of state. Except as provided in section 312f(1), an original vehicle group designation or passenger or school bus indorsement must not be issued by the secretary of state without a driving skills test conducted by an examiner appointed or authorized by the secretary of state or an equivalent driving skills test meeting the requirements of 49 CFR part 383 conducted in another jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as otherwise provided in this act, the secretary of state may waive the requirement of a driving skills test, knowledge test, or road sign test of an applicant for an original operator's or chauffeur's license without a vehicle group designation or indorsement who at the time of the application is the holder of a valid, unrevoked operator's or chauffeur's license issued by another state or country.</div>

The secretary of state may establish a longer duration for the validity of a temporary driver's permit if necessary to accommodate the process of obtaining a background check that is required for an applicant by federal law. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) An operator or chauffeur may indicate on the license in a place designated by the secretary of state his or her blood type, emergency contact information, immunization data, medication data, or a statement that the licensee is deaf.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) Subsections (8), (9), and (10) do not apply to a person who is in possession of 1 or more photocopies, reproductions, or duplications of a license to document the identity of the licensee for a legitimate business purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) A sticker or decal may be provided by any person, hospital, school, medical group, or association interested in assisting in implementing an emergency medical information card, but must meet the specifications of the secretary of state. An emergency medical information card may contain information concerning the licensee's patient advocate designation, other emergency medical information, or an indication as to where the licensee has stored or registered emergency medical information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) The secretary of state shall inquire of each licensee, in person or by mail, whether the licensee agrees to participate in the anatomical gift donor registry under part 101 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.10101 to 333.10123.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) A licensee who has agreed to participate in the anatomical gift donor registry under part 101 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.10101 to 333.10123, must not be considered to have revoked that agreement solely because the licensee's license has been revoked or suspended or has expired. Enrollment in the donor registry constitutes a legal agreement that remains binding and in effect after the donor's death regardless of the expressed desires of the deceased donor's next of kin who may oppose the donor's anatomical gift.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) If an operator's or chauffeur's license is issued to an individual described in section 307(1)(b) who has temporary lawful status, the license must be issued in compliance with 6 CFR 37.21 or in compliance with the process established to comply with 6 CFR 37.71 by the secretary of state. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) An operator or chauffeur seeking an election for a communication impediment designation under subsection (13) shall provide to the secretary of state a certification that meets all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Is signed by a physician, physician assistant, certified nurse practitioner, audiologist, speech-language pathologist, psychologist, or physical therapist licensed to practice in this state. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Attests to the nature of the communication impediment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) A person who intentionally makes a false statement of material fact or commits or attempts to commit a deception or fraud on a statement described under subsection (21) is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 30 days or a fine of not more than $500.00, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(23) Subject to subsection (24), the secretary of state may cancel or revoke a communication impediment designation elected and maintained under this section if either of the following circumstances applies:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The secretary of state determines that a communication impediment designation was fraudulently or erroneously elected. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(24) The secretary of state shall provide the operator or chauffeur notice and an opportunity to be heard before canceling or revoking a communication impediment designation under subsection (23).</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>257.323 Denial, revocation, suspension, or restriction of operator or chauffeur's license, vehicle group designation, or indorsement; final determination; petition for review of determination; order setting cause for hearing; service of order, petition, and affidavits on secretary of state's office; testimony and examination; order affirming, modifying, or setting aside restriction, suspension, or denial; conditions; restricted driving privileges; vehicle owned by employer; notification; other requirements.</B><P>Sec. 323.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A person aggrieved by a final determination of the secretary of state denying the person an operator's or chauffeur's license, a vehicle group designation, or an indorsement on a license or revoking, suspending, or restricting an operator's or chauffeur's license, vehicle group designation, or an indorsement may petition for a review of the determination in the circuit court in the county where the person was arrested if the denial or suspension was imposed under section 625f or under the order of a trial court under section 328 or, in all other cases, in the circuit court in the person's county of residence. The person shall file the petition within 63 days after the determination is made except that for good cause shown the court may allow the person to file petition within 182 days after the determination is made. As provided in section 625f, a peace officer aggrieved by a determination of a hearing officer in favor of a person who requested a hearing under section 625f may, with the prosecuting attorney's consent, petition for review of the determination in the circuit court in the county where the arrest was made. The peace officer shall file the petition within 63 days after the determination is made except that for good cause shown the court may allow the peace officer to file the petition within 182 days after the determination is made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the circuit court shall enter an order setting the cause for hearing for a day certain not more than 63 days after the order's date. The order, a copy of the petition that includes the person's full name, current address, birth date, and driver's license number, and all supporting affidavits must be served on the secretary of state's office in Lansing not less than 20 days before the date set for the hearing. If the person is seeking a review of the record prepared under section 322 or section 625f, the service upon the secretary of state must be made not less than 50 days before the date set for the hearing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The court may take testimony and examine all the facts and circumstances relating to the denial, suspension, or restriction of the person's license under sections 303(1)(d), 320, or 904(10) or (11), a licensing action under section 310d, or a suspension for a first violation under section 625f. The court may affirm, modify, or set aside the restriction, suspension, or denial, except the court shall not order the secretary of state to issue a restricted or unrestricted chauffeur's license that would permit the person to drive a commercial motor vehicle that hauls a hazardous material. The court shall enter the order and the petitioner shall file a certified copy of the order with the secretary of state's office in Lansing within 7 days after entry of the order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as otherwise provided in this section, in reviewing a determination resulting in a denial, suspension, restriction, or revocation under this act, the court shall confine its consideration to a review of the record prepared under section 322 or 625f or the driving record created under section 204a for a statutory legal issue, and may determine that the petitioner is eligible for full driving privileges or, if the petitioner is subject to a revocation under section 303, may determine that the petitioner is eligible for restricted driving privileges. The court shall set aside the secretary of state's determination only if 1 or more of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) In determining whether a petitioner is eligible for full driving privileges, the petitioner's substantial rights have been prejudiced because the determination is any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) In violation of the Constitution of the United States, the state constitution of 1963, or a statute.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) In excess of the secretary of state's statutory authority or jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Made upon unlawful procedure resulting in material prejudice to the petitioner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Not supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) Arbitrary, capricious, or clearly an abuse or unwarranted exercise of discretion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) Affected by other substantial and material error of law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) In determining whether a petitioner is eligible for review of a revocation or denial under section 303, or whether a petitioner is eligible for restricted driving privileges, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The petitioner's substantial rights have been prejudiced as described in subdivision (a).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) All of the following are satisfied:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) The revocation or denial occurred at least 1 year after the petitioner's license was revoked or denied, or, if the petitioner's license was previously revoked or denied within the 7 years preceding the most recent revocation or denial, at least 5 years after the most recent revocation or denial, whichever is later.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) The court finds that the petitioner meets the department's requirements under the rules promulgated by the department under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.238. For purposes of this sub-subparagraph only, the court may take additional testimony to supplement the record prepared under section 322 or 625f or the driving record created under section 204a, but shall not expand the record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(C) If the revocation or denial was under section 303(2)(a), (b), (c), or (g), the petitioner rebuts by clear and convincing evidence the presumption that he or she is a habitual offender, and establishes to the court's satisfaction that he or she is likely to adhere to any requirements imposed by the court. For purposes of this sub-subparagraph, the conviction that resulted in the revocation and any record of denial of reinstatement by the department are prima facie evidence that the petitioner is a habitual offender. For purposes of this sub-subparagraph only, the court may take additional testimony to supplement the record prepared under section 322 or 625f or the driving record created under section 204a, but shall not expand the record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the court determines that a petitioner is eligible for restricted driving privileges under subsection (4)(b), the court shall issue an order that includes, but is not limited to, all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The court's findings under section 303 and R 257.1 to R 257.1727 of the Michigan Administrative Code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A requirement that each motor vehicle operated by the petitioner be equipped with a properly installed and functioning ignition interlock device for a period of not less than 1 year before the petitioner will be eligible to return to the secretary of state for a hearing. The petitioner shall bear the cost of an ignition interlock device required under this subdivision. A restricted license must not be issued to the petitioner until the secretary of state has verified that 1 or more ignition interlock devices, if applicable, have been installed as required by this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A method by which the court will verify that the petitioner maintains no-fault insurance for each vehicle described in subdivision (b) as required by chapter 31 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.3101 to 500.3179.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A requirement that a restricted license issued to the petitioner must not permit the petitioner to operate a commercial motor vehicle that hauls hazardous materials.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A provision that the secretary of state shall revoke the petitioner's restricted license if any of the following occur:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The petitioner violates the restrictions on his or her license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The petitioner violates subdivision (b).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The petitioner removes, or causes to be removed, an ignition interlock device required under subdivision (b), unless the secretary of state has authorized the removal under section 322a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The petitioner commits an act that would be a major violation if the petitioner's license had been issued under section 322(6) or consumes alcohol or a controlled substance without a prescription. As used in this subparagraph, "major violation" means that term as defined in R 257.301a of the Michigan Administrative Code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(v) The petitioner is arrested for a violation of section 625 or a local ordinance, law of this state or another state, or law of the United States that substantially corresponds to section 625.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the court determines that a petitioner is eligible for restricted driving privileges under this section and the petitioner intends to operate a vehicle owned by his or her employer, the court shall notify the employer of the petitioner's obligation under subsection (5)(b). This subsection does not require an employer who receives a notice under this subsection to install an ignition interlock device on a vehicle. This subsection does not apply to a vehicle that is operated by a self-employed individual who uses the vehicle for both business and personal use.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a court determines that a petitioner is eligible for restricted driving privileges, the secretary of state shall not issue a restricted license to the petitioner until he or she has satisfied any other applicable requirements of state or federal law, and shall not issue a restricted license to the petitioner if the order granting eligibility for restricted driving privileges does not comply with subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a court determines that a petitioner is eligible for restricted driving privileges, the court shall notify the department of its determination through the issuance of an order under subsection (5) and shall not retain jurisdiction over a license issued under this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The owner of a motor vehicle who operates or permits the operation of the motor vehicle on the highways of this state or the operator of the motor vehicle shall produce, under subsection (2), on the request of a police officer, evidence that the motor vehicle is insured under chapter 31 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.3101 to 500.3179. Subject to section 907(14), an owner or operator of a motor vehicle who fails to produce evidence of insurance on request under this subsection or who fails to have motor vehicle insurance for the vehicle as required under chapter 31 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.3101 to 500.3179, is responsible for a civil infraction. If an individual displays an electronic copy of his or her certificate of insurance using an electronic device, the police officer shall only view the electronic copy of the certificate of insurance and shall not manipulate the electronic device to view any other information on the electronic device. An individual who displays an electronic copy of his or her certificate of insurance using an electronic device as provided in this subsection is not presumed to have consented to a search of the electronic device. A police officer may require the individual to electronically forward the electronic copy of the certificate of insurance to a specified location provided by the police officer. The police officer may then view the electronic copy of the certificate of insurance in a setting in which it is safe for the officer to verify that the information contained in the electronic copy of the certificate of insurance is valid and accurate. This state, a law enforcement agency, or an employee of this state or a law enforcement agency is not liable for damage to or loss of an electronic device that occurs as a result of a police officer's viewing an electronic copy of a certificate of insurance in the manner provided in this section, regardless of whether the police officer or the owner or operator of the vehicle was in possession of the electronic device at the time the damage or loss occurred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A certificate of insurance, in paper or electronic form and issued by an insurance company, that certifies that the security that meets the requirements of sections 3101 and 3102 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.3101 and 500.3102, is in force is prima facie evidence that insurance is in force for the motor vehicle described in the certificate of insurance until the expiration date shown on the certificate. The certificate, in addition to describing the motor vehicles for which insurance is in effect, must, if applicable, state the name of each individual named on the policy, policy declaration, or a declaration certificate whose operation of the vehicle would cause the liability coverage of that insurance to become void.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If, before the appearance date on a citation issued under subsection (1), the defendant submits proof to the court that the motor vehicle had insurance meeting the requirements of sections 3101 and 3102 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.3101 and 500.3102, at the time the violation of subsection (1) occurred, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The court shall not assess a fine or costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The court shall not forward an abstract of the court record to the secretary of state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The court may assess a fee of not more than $25.00 that shall be paid to the court funding unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If an owner or operator of a motor vehicle is determined to be responsible for a violation of subsection (1), the court in which the civil infraction determination is entered may require the individual to surrender his or her operator's or chauffeur's license unless proof that the vehicle has insurance that meets the requirements of sections 3101 and 3102 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.3101 and 500.3102, is submitted to the court. If the court requires the license to be surrendered, the court shall order the secretary of state to suspend the individual's license. The court shall immediately destroy the license and shall forward an abstract of the court record to the secretary of state as required by section 732. On receipt of the abstract, the secretary of state shall suspend the individual's license beginning with the date on which the individual is determined to be responsible for the civil infraction for a period of 30 days or until proof of insurance that meets the requirements of sections 3101 and 3102 of the insurance code of 1956, 1956 PA 218, MCL 500.3101 and 500.3102, is submitted to the secretary of state, whichever occurs later. An individual who submits proof of insurance to the secretary of state under this subsection shall pay a service fee of $25.00 to the secretary of state. The individual shall not be required to be examined under section 320c and shall not be required to pay a replacement license fee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If an owner or operator of a motor vehicle is determined to be responsible for a violation of subsection (1), the court in which the civil infraction determination is entered shall notify the secretary of state of the vehicle registration number and the year and make of the motor vehicle being operated at the time of the violation. A notification under this subsection must be made on the abstract or on a form approved by the supreme court administrator. On receipt, the secretary of state shall immediately enter this information in the records of the department. The secretary of state shall not renew, transfer, or replace the registration plate of the vehicle involved in the violation or allow the purchase of a new registration plate for the vehicle involved in the violation until the owner meets the requirements of section 227a or unless the vehicle involved in the violation is transferred or sold to a person other than the owner's spouse, mother, father, sister, brother, or child.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An owner or operator of a motor vehicle who knowingly produces false evidence under this section is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 1 year or a fine of not more than $1,000.00, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Points must not be entered on a driver's record under section 320a for a violation of this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) This section does not apply to the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that is registered in a state other than this state or a foreign country or province.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 401.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   This section shall not be construed to limit the right of a person to bring a civil action for damages for injuries to either person or property resulting from a violation of this act by the owner or operator of a motor vehicle or his or her agent or servant. The owner of a motor vehicle is liable for an injury caused by the negligent operation of the motor vehicle whether the negligence consists of a violation of a statute of this state or the ordinary care standard required by common law. The owner is not liable unless the motor vehicle is being driven with his or her express or implied consent or knowledge. It is presumed that the motor vehicle is being driven with the knowledge and consent of the owner if it is driven at the time of the injury by his or her spouse, father, mother, brother, sister, son, daughter, or other immediate member of the family.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A person engaged in the business of leasing motor vehicles who is the lessor of a motor vehicle under a lease providing for the use of the motor vehicle by the lessee for a period that is greater than 30 days, or a dealer acting as agent for that lessor, is not liable at common law for damages for injuries to either person or property resulting from the operation of the leased motor vehicle, including damages occurring after the expiration of the lease if the vehicle is in the possession of the lessee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Notwithstanding subsection (1), a person engaged in the business of leasing motor vehicles who is the lessor of a motor vehicle under a lease providing for the use of the motor vehicle by the lessee for a period of 30 days or less is liable for an injury caused by the negligent operation of the leased motor vehicle only if the injury occurred while the leased motor vehicle was being operated by an authorized driver under the lease agreement or by the lessee's spouse, father, mother, brother, sister, son, daughter, or other immediate family member. Unless the lessor, or his or her agent, was negligent in the leasing of the motor vehicle, the lessor's liability under this subsection is limited to $20,000.00 because of bodily injury to or death of 1 person in any 1 accident and $40,000.00 because of bodily injury to or death of 2 or more persons in any 1 accident.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A person engaged in the business of leasing motor vehicles as provided under subsection (3) shall notify a lessee that the lessor is liable only up to the maximum amounts provided for in subsection (3), and only if the leased motor vehicle was being operated by the lessee or other authorized driver or by the lessee's spouse, father, mother, brother, sister, son, daughter, or other immediate family member, and that the lessee may be liable to the lessor up to amounts provided for in subsection (3), and to an injured person for amounts awarded in excess of the maximum amounts provided for in subsection (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Subsections (3) and (4) shall not be construed to expand or reduce, except as otherwise provided by this act, the liability of a person engaged in the business of leasing motor vehicles or to impair that person's right to indemnity or contribution, or both.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   As used in subsections (3), (4), and (5), "motor vehicle" means a self-propelled device by which a person or property may be transported upon a public highway. Motor vehicle does not include a bus, power shovel, road machinery, agricultural machinery, or other machinery or vehicle not designed primarily for highway transportation. Motor vehicle also does not include a device that moves upon or is guided by a track.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A lessee in possession of an off lease vehicle, and not the dealer of the vehicle, is liable as the owner of the vehicle for any damages awarded for an injury to a person or property resulting from the operation of the vehicle. The dealer of an off lease vehicle may be liable at common law for damages awarded for an injury to a person or property resulting from the operation of the vehicle only if the dealer is in possession of the vehicle and the certificate of title and has acknowledged possession of the certificate of title to the lessor. </DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Service of summons in any action against a person, who at the time of such service is a nonresident of this state, growing out of any accident or collision in which such person may have been involved while operating a motor vehicle upon a public highway of this state or in which a motor vehicle owned by him may have been involved while being operated with his consent, express or implied, on such public highway, may be made upon the secretary of state as the true and lawful attorney of such person with the same legal force as if served on him personally within this state. Service of such summons shall be made by leaving a copy thereof with the secretary of state, or his deputy, who shall keep a record of each such process and the day and hour of service, and such service shall be sufficient service upon such nonresident, provided that notice of such service and a copy of the summons are forthwith either served upon the defendant personally by the sheriff or constable of the county in which he resides or sent by registered mail by the plaintiff or his attorney to the defendant. If personal service of such notice and copy of summons is had upon the defendant the officer making the service shall so certify in his return which shall be filed with the court having jurisdiction of said cause, or if service be made by registered mail then the plaintiff or his attorney shall make an affidavit showing that he has made service of the notice of summons upon the defendant by registered mail as herein provided and the affiant shall attach thereto a true copy of the summons and notice so served and the registry receipt of the defendant and shall file the affidavit and attached papers with the court having jurisdiction of the cause. The court in which the action is pending may order such extension of time as may be necessary to afford the defendant reasonable opportunity to defend the action.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The death of the nonresident shall not operate to revoke the appointment by the nonresident of the secretary of state as his true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served the summons in an action against him growing out of any such accident or collision; and in event of his death, any action growing out of such accident or collision may be commenced or prosecuted against his executor or administrator duly appointed by the state, territory or district of the United States or foreign country in which the nonresident was domiciled at the time of his death, and service of the summons shall be made upon the secretary of state, and personal service of such notice and the copy of the summons be had upon his executor or administrator in like manner with the same force and effect as service upon such nonresident during his lifetime.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Any action or proceeding pending in any court of this state, in which the court shall have obtained jurisdiction of such nonresident pursuant to the provision of this statute, shall not abate by reason of the death of such nonresident, but his executor or administrator duly appointed in the state, territory or district of the United States or foreign country in which he was domiciled at the time of his death, shall, upon the application of the plaintiff in the action, and upon such notice as the court may prescribe, be brought in and substituted in the place of the decedent, and the action or proceeding shall continue.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A "motor vehicle liability policy" as used in this chapter, shall mean an owner's or an operator's policy of liability insurance, certified as provided in section 518 or section 519 as proof of financial responsibility, and issued, except as otherwise provided in section 519, by an insurance carrier duly authorized to transact business in this state, to or for the benefit of the person named therein as insured.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Such owner's policy of liability insurance:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Shall designate by explicit description or by appropriate reference all motor vehicles with respect to which coverage is thereby to be granted; and</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Shall insure the person named therein and any other person, as insured, using any such motor vehicle or motor vehicles with the express or implied permission of such named insured, against loss from the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of such motor vehicle or motor vehicles within the United States of America or the Dominion of Canada, subject to limits exclusive of interest and costs, with respect to each such motor vehicle, as follows: $20,000.00 because of bodily injury to or death of 1 person in any 1 accident and, subject to said limit for 1 person, $40,000.00 because of bodily injury to or death of 2 or more persons in any 1 accident, and $10,000.00 because of injury to or destruction of property of others in any 1 accident;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   When a certificate is filed showing that a policy or policies have been issued covering all motor vehicles owned by the insured but not insuring such person when operating any motor vehicle not owned by him, it shall be unlawful for such person to operate any motor vehicle not owned by him or not covered by such certificate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Such operator's policy of liability insurance shall insure the person named as insured therein against loss from the liability imposed upon him by law for damages arising out of the use by him of any motor vehicle not owned by him, within the same territorial limits and subject to the same limits of liability as are set forth above with respect to an owner's policy of liability insurance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Such motor vehicle liability policy shall state the name and address of the named insured, the coverage afforded by the policy, the policy period, and the limits of liability, and shall contain an agreement or be indorsed that insurance is provided thereunder in accordance with the coverage defined in this chapter as respects bodily injury and death or property damage, or both, and is subject to all the provisions of this chapter.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Such motor vehicle liability policy need not insure any liability under any workmen's compensation law nor any liability on account of bodily injury to or death of an employee of the insured while engaged in the employment, other than domestic, of the insured, or while engaged in the operation, maintenance or repair of any such motor vehicle nor any liability for damage to property owned by, rented to, in charge of, or transported by the insured.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   Every motor vehicle liability policy shall be subject to the following provisions which need not be contained therein:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The liability of the insurance carrier with respect to the insurance required by this chapter shall become absolute whenever injury or damage covered by said motor vehicle liability policy occurs; said policy may not be cancelled or annulled as to such liability by any agreement between the insurance carrier and the insured after the occurrence of the injury or damage; no statement made by the insured or on his behalf and no violation of said policy shall defeat or void said policy, and except as hereinafter provided, no fraud, misrepresentation, assumption of liability or other act of the insured in obtaining or retaining such policy, or in adjusting a claim under such policy, and no failure of the insured to give any notice, forward any paper or otherwise cooperate with the insurance carrier, shall constitute a defense as against such judgment creditor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The satisfaction by the insured of a judgment for such injury or damage shall not be a condition precedent to the right or duty of the insurance carrier to make payment on account of such injury or damage.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If any person shall secure final judgment against the insured for loss or damage covered by any such policy and if such judgment is not satisfied within 30 days after it shall have become final, then such judgment creditor shall be entitled to recover under the terms of such policy in the same manner and to the same extent as the insured, except as hereinafter provided.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The insurance carrier shall have the right to settle any claim covered by the policy, and if such settlement is made in good faith, the amount thereof shall be deductible from the limits of liability specified in subparagraph (2) of paragraph (b) of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The policy, the written application therefor, if any, and any rider or indorsement which does not conflict with the provisions of this chapter, shall constitute the entire contract between the parties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The insurance carrier shall not be liable on any judgment if it has not had prompt notice of and reasonable opportunity to appear in and defend the action in which such judgment was rendered, or if the judgment has been obtained through collusion between the judgment creditor and the insured.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Any policy which grants the coverage required for a motor vehicle liability policy may also grant any lawful coverage in excess of or in addition to the coverage specified for a motor vehicle liability policy and such excess or additional coverage shall not be subject to the provisions of this chapter. With respect to a policy which grants such excess or additional coverage the term "motor vehicle liability policy" shall apply only to that part of the coverage which is required by this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   Any motor vehicle liability policy may provide that the insured shall reimburse the insurance carrier for any payment the insurance carrier would not have been obligated to make under the terms of the policy except for the provisions of this chapter.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) When traffic is controlled by traffic control signals, not fewer than 1 signal shall be located over the traveled portion of the roadway so as to give vehicle operators a clear indication of the right-of-way assignment from their normal positions approaching the intersection. The vehicle signals shall exhibit different colored lights successively, 1 at a time, or with arrows. Red arrow and yellow arrow indications have the same meaning as the corresponding circular indications, except that they apply only to vehicle operators intending to make the movement indicated by the arrow. The following colors shall be used, and the terms and lights shall indicate and apply to vehicle operators as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the signal exhibits a green indication, vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at that place prohibits either turn.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or at a limit line when marked or, if there is no crosswalk or limit line, before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown, except as provided in subparagraph (ii).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal, after stopping before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or at a limit line when marked or, if there is no crosswalk or limit line, before entering the intersection, may make a right turn from a 1-way or 2-way street into a 2-way street or into a 1-way street carrying traffic in the direction of the right turn or may make a left turn from a 1-way or 2-way street into a 1-way roadway carrying traffic in the direction of the left turn, unless prohibited by sign, signal, marking, light, or other traffic control device. The vehicular traffic shall yield the right of way to pedestrians and bicyclists lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If the signal exhibits a steady green arrow indication, vehicular traffic facing the green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow or other movement permitted by other indications shown at the same time. The vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and bicyclists lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section apply except for those provisions that by their nature cannot apply. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of a sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A person who violates subsection (1) or (2) is responsible for a civil infraction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A vehicle operator who approaches a person using a wheelchair or a device to aid the person to walk at a crosswalk or any other pedestrian crossing shall take necessary precautions to avoid accident or injury to the person using the wheelchair or device. A person who violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A sign prohibiting a turn on a red signal as provided in subsection (1)(c)(ii) shall be located above or adjacent to the traffic control signal or as close as possible to the point where the turn is made, or at both locations, so that 1 or more of the signs are visible to a vehicle operator intending to turn, at the point where the turn is made. An additional sign may be used at the far side of the intersection in the direct line of vision of the turning vehicle operator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Subject to federal law, a temporary traffic control signal may be located on, over, or adjacent to the traveled portion of the roadway.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe that a person was operating a vehicle upon a public highway or other place open to the public or generally accessible to motor vehicles, including an area designated for the parking of vehicles, within this state and that the person by the consumption of alcoholic liquor, a controlled substance, or other intoxicating substance or a combination of them may have affected his or her ability to operate a vehicle, or reasonable cause to believe that a person was operating a commercial motor vehicle within the state while the person's blood, breath, or urine contained any measurable amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or any other intoxicating substance or while the person had any detectable presence of alcoholic liquor, a controlled substance or any other intoxicating substance, or any combination of them, or reasonable cause to believe that a person who is less than 21 years of age was operating a vehicle upon a public highway or other place open to the public or generally accessible to motor vehicles, including an area designated for the parking of vehicles, within this state while the person had any bodily alcohol content as that term is defined in section 625(6), may require the person to submit to a preliminary chemical breath analysis.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A person who was operating a commercial motor vehicle and who is requested to submit to a preliminary chemical breath analysis under this section must be advised that refusing a peace officer's request to take a test described in this section is a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $100.00, or both, and will result in the issuance of a 24-hour out-of-service order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A person who was operating a commercial motor vehicle and who refuses to submit to a preliminary chemical breath analysis upon a peace officer's lawful request is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $100.00, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The following provisions apply to chemical tests and analysis of a person's blood, urine, or breath, other than a preliminary chemical breath analysis:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A person arrested for a crime described in section 625c(1) must be advised of all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If he or she takes a chemical test of his or her blood, urine, or breath administered at the request of a peace officer, he or she has the right to demand that a person of his or her own choosing administer 1 of the chemical tests.</div>

Liability for a crime or civil damages predicated on the act of withdrawing or analyzing blood and related procedures does not attach to a licensed physician or individual operating under the delegation of a licensed physician who withdraws or analyzes blood or assists in the withdrawal or analysis in accordance with this act unless the withdrawal or analysis is performed in a negligent manner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A chemical test described in this subsection must be administered at the request of a peace officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person has committed a crime described in section 625c(1).

If the person charged is administered a chemical test by a person of his or her own choosing, the person charged is responsible for obtaining a chemical analysis of the test sample.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If, after an accident, the driver of a vehicle involved in the accident is transported to a medical facility and a sample of the driver's blood is withdrawn at that time for medical treatment, the results of a chemical analysis of that sample are admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding to show the amount of alcohol or presence of a controlled substance or other intoxicating substance in the person's blood at the time alleged, regardless of whether the person had been offered or had refused a chemical test. The medical facility or person performing the chemical analysis shall disclose the results of the analysis to a prosecuting attorney who requests the results for use in a criminal prosecution as provided in this subdivision. A medical facility or person disclosing information in compliance with this subsection is not civilly or criminally liable for making the disclosure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) If, after an accident, the driver of a vehicle involved in the accident is deceased, a sample of the decedent's blood must be withdrawn in a manner directed by the medical examiner to determine the amount of alcohol or the presence of a controlled substance or other intoxicating substance, or any combination of them, in the decedent's blood. The medical examiner shall give the results of the chemical analysis of the sample to the law enforcement agency investigating the accident and that agency shall forward the results to the department of state police.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The department of state police shall promulgate uniform rules in compliance with the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, for the administration of chemical tests for the purposes of this section. An instrument used for a preliminary chemical breath analysis may be used for a chemical test described in this subsection if approved under rules promulgated by the department of state police.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The provisions of subsection (6) relating to chemical testing do not limit the introduction of any other admissible evidence bearing upon any of the following questions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Whether the person was impaired by, or under the influence of, alcoholic liquor, a controlled substance or other intoxicating substance, or a combination of alcoholic liquor, a controlled substance, or other intoxicating substance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Whether the person had an alcohol content of 0.08 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine or, beginning 5 years after the state treasurer publishes a certification under section 625(28), the person had an alcohol content of 0.10 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the person is less than 21 years of age, whether the person had any bodily alcohol content within his or her body. As used in this subdivision, "any bodily alcohol content" means either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) An alcohol content of 0.02 grams or more but less than 0.08 grams per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine or, beginning 5 years after the state treasurer publishes a certification under section 625(28), the person had an alcohol content of 0.02 grams or more but less than 0.10 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Any presence of alcohol within a person's body resulting from the consumption of alcoholic liquor, other than the consumption of alcoholic liquor as a part of a generally recognized religious service or ceremony.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a chemical test described in subsection (6) is administered, the test results must be made available to the person charged or the person's attorney upon written request to the prosecution, with a copy of the request filed with the court. The prosecution shall furnish the results at least 2 days before the day of the trial. The prosecution shall offer the test results as evidence in that trial. Failure to fully comply with the request bars the admission of the results into evidence by the prosecution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A person's refusal to submit to a chemical test as provided in subsection (6) is admissible in a criminal prosecution for a crime described in section 625c(1) only to show that a test was offered to the defendant, but not as evidence in determining the defendant's innocence or guilt. The jury must be instructed accordingly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Controlled substance" means that term as defined in section 7104 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7104.</div>

Not more than 1 adjournment shall be granted to a party, and the length of an adjournment must not exceed 14 days.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except for delay attributable to the unavailability of the defendant, a witness, or material evidence or due to an interlocutory appeal or exceptional circumstances, but not a delay caused by docket congestion, the court shall finally adjudicate, by a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, entry of a verdict, or other final disposition, a case in which the defendant is charged with a misdemeanor violation of section 625(1), (3), (6), (7), or (8) or section 625m or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to section 625(1), (3), (6), or (8) or section 625m, within 77 days after the person is arrested for the violation or, if an arrest warrant is issued or reissued, not more than 77 days after the date the issued or reissued arrest warrant is served, whichever is later. The court shall not dismiss a case or impose any other sanction for a failure to comply with this time limit. The 77-day time limit does not apply to a violation of section 625(1), (3), (7), or (8) or section 625m punishable as a felony or a violation of section 625(1), (3), (6), (7), or (8) or section 625m joined with a felony charge.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere under section 625 or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to section 625(1), (2), (3), (6), or (8), the court shall advise the accused of the maximum possible term of imprisonment and the maximum possible fine that may be imposed for the violation and shall advise the defendant that the maximum possible license sanctions that may be imposed will be based upon the master driving record maintained by the secretary of state under section 204a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Before imposing sentence for a violation of section 625(1), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), or (8) or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to section 625(1), (3), (6), or (8), the court shall order the person to undergo screening and assessment by a person or agency designated by the office of substance abuse services to determine whether the person is likely to benefit from rehabilitative services, including alcohol or drug education and alcohol or drug treatment programs. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the court may order the person to participate in and successfully complete 1 or more appropriate rehabilitative programs as part of the sentence. If the person was convicted under section 625(1)(c) or has 1 or more prior convictions, the court shall order the person to participate in and successfully complete 1 or more appropriate rehabilitative programs as part of the sentence, including, but not limited to, an alcohol treatment program or a self-help program for a period of not less than 1 year. The treatment plan must be devised from an assessment performed by an appropriately licensed alcohol assessor and approved by the court. If the person has 2 or more prior convictions, the court shall order the person to undergo an assessment that uses a standardized evidence-based instrument performed by a provider or other licensed or certified substance use disorder professional to determine whether he or she has a diagnosis for alcohol dependence and would likely benefit from a United States Food and Drug Administration approved medication-assisted treatment that is indicated for the treatment of alcohol dependence, as specified in the most recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association. A person may request an independent assessment that uses a standardized evidence-based instrument and that is performed by a provider or other licensed or certified substance use disorder professional to determine whether he or she has a diagnosis for alcohol dependence and would likely benefit from a United States Food and Drug Administration approved medication-assisted treatment that is indicated for the treatment of alcohol dependence, as specified in the most recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association. A court shall grant a request for an independent assessment and shall consider the results of the independent assessment along with the assessment required under this subsection when determining if the court will refer the person to a rehabilitative program that offers 1 or more forms of United States Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Only a provider may recommend that a person take medication-assisted treatment. A person always maintains the right to refuse ingestion or injection of medication. Only a provider may determine the type, dosage, and duration of the medication-assisted treatment. If the person refuses to take the medication-assisted treatment, the court shall not hold that person in contempt. As used in this subsection, "provider" means an individual with prescribing authority under the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.1101 to 333.25211, who regularly communicates with the treatment team during the defendant's recovery and who has training or experience that demonstrates the provider's ability to treat and manage patients with alcohol dependency. If no other identified funding source is available, the person shall pay for the costs of the screening, assessment, or assessments, as applicable, and rehabilitative services ordered under this subsection. This subsection does not require the person to successfully complete an ordered rehabilitative program before driving a vehicle with an ignition interlock device on a restricted license. As used in this subsection, "other licensed or certified substance use disorder professional" means an individual or organization licensed or credentialed in this state to treat substance use disorders, including individuals certified by the Michigan certification board for addiction professionals and individuals who have training in providing assessments for alcohol dependency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the judgment and sentence are appealed to circuit court, the court may ex parte order the secretary of state to stay the suspension, revocation, or restricted license issued by the secretary of state pending the outcome of the appeal.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a person who refuses to submit to a chemical test pursuant to section 625d does not request a hearing within 14 days after the date of notice pursuant to section 625e, the secretary of state shall impose the following license sanctions:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the person was operating a vehicle other than a commercial motor vehicle, suspend or deny the person's operator's or chauffeur's license or permit to drive, or nonresident operating privilege, for 1 year or, for a second or subsequent refusal within 7 years, for 2 years. If the person is a resident without a license or permit to operate a vehicle in the state, the secretary of state shall not issue the person a license or permit for 1 year or, for a second or subsequent refusal within 7 years, for 2 years.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the person was operating a commercial motor vehicle, for the first refusal, suspend all vehicle group designations on the person's operator's or chauffeur's license or permit or nonresident privilege to operate a commercial motor vehicle or, if the person is a resident without a license or permit to operate a commercial motor vehicle in the state, not issue the person an operator's or chauffeur's license with vehicle group designations, for 1 year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If the person was operating a commercial motor vehicle, for a second or subsequent refusal that occurred in a separate incident from and within 10 years of a prior refusal, revoke all vehicle group designations on the person's operator's or chauffeur's license or permit or nonresident privilege to operate a commercial motor vehicle or, if the person is a resident without a license or permit to operate a commercial motor vehicle in the state, not issue the person an operator's or chauffeur's license with vehicle group designations, for not less than 10 years and until the person is approved for the issuance of a vehicle group designation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   If the person was operating a commercial motor vehicle and was arrested for an offense enumerated in section 625c other than a violation of section 625a(5) or 625m, impose the license sanction described in subdivision (a) and the license sanction described in subdivision (b) or (c), as applicable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a hearing is requested, the secretary of state shall hold the hearing in the same manner and under the same conditions as provided in section 322. Not less than 5 days' notice of the hearing shall be mailed to the person requesting the hearing, to the peace officer who filed the report under section 625d, and if the prosecuting attorney requests receipt of the notice, to the prosecuting attorney of the county where the arrest was made. The hearing officer may administer oaths, issue subpoenas for the attendance of necessary witnesses, and grant a reasonable request for an adjournment. Not more than 1 adjournment shall be granted to a party and the length of an adjournment shall not exceed 14 days. A hearing under this subsection shall be scheduled to be held within 45 days after the date of arrest for the violation. The hearing officer shall not impose any sanction for a failure to comply with these time limits.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except for delay attributable to the unavailability of the defendant, a witness, or material evidence, or due to an interlocutory appeal or exceptional circumstances, but not a delay caused by docket congestion, a hearing shall be finally adjudicated within 77 days after the date of arrest. The hearing officer shall not impose any sanction for a failure to comply with this time limit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The hearing shall cover only the following issues:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Whether the peace officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the person had committed a crime described in section 625c(1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Whether the person was placed under arrest for a crime described in section 625c(1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If the person refused to submit to the test upon the request of the officer, whether the refusal was reasonable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Whether the person was advised of the rights under section 625a(6).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A person shall not order a hearing officer to make a particular finding on any issue enumerated in subsection (4)(a) to (d).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The hearing officer shall make a record of a hearing held pursuant to this section. The record shall be prepared and transcribed in accordance with section 86 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.286. Upon notification of the filing of a petition for judicial review pursuant to section 323 and not less than 10 days before the matter is set for review, the hearing officer shall transmit to the court in which the petition was filed the original or a certified copy of the official record of the proceedings. Proceedings at which evidence was presented need not be transcribed and transmitted if the sole reason for review is to determine whether the court will order the issuance of a restricted license. The parties to the proceedings for judicial review may stipulate that the record be shortened. A party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to a shortened record may be taxed by the court in which the petition is filed for the additional costs. The court may permit subsequent corrections to the record.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If the person who requested a hearing does not prevail, the secretary of state shall impose the following license sanctions after the hearing:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the person was operating a vehicle other than a commercial motor vehicle, suspend or deny issuance of a license or driving permit or a nonresident operating privilege of the person for 1 year or, for a second or subsequent refusal within 7 years, for 2 years. If the person is a resident without a license or permit to operate a vehicle in the state, the secretary of state shall not issue the person a license or permit for 1 year or, for a second or subsequent refusal within 7 years, for 2 years. The person may file a petition in the circuit court of the county in which the arrest was made to review the suspension or denial as provided in section 323.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the person was operating a commercial motor vehicle, impose the sanction prescribed under subsection (1)(b) or (1)(c), as applicable. The person may file a petition in the circuit court of the county in which the arrest was made to review the suspension or denial as provided in section 323.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If the person was operating a commercial motor vehicle and was arrested for an offense enumerated in section 625c other than a violation of section 625a(5) or 625m, impose the license sanctions described in subdivisions (a) and (b).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If the person who requested the hearing prevails, the peace officer who filed the report under section 625d may, with the consent of the prosecuting attorney, file a petition in the circuit court of the county in which the arrest was made to review the determination of the hearing officer as provided in section 323.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   When it has been finally determined that a nonresident's privilege to operate a vehicle in the state has been suspended or denied, the department shall give notice in writing of the action taken to the motor vehicle administrator of the state of the person's residence and of each state in which he or she has a license to operate a motor vehicle.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) On behalf of the secretary of state, immediately confiscate the person's license or permit to operate a motor vehicle and, if the person is otherwise eligible for a license or permit, issue a temporary license or permit to the person. The temporary license or permit must be on a form provided by the secretary of state.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The drunk driving prevention equipment and training fund is created as a separate fund in the state treasury. Money in the fund shall be expended only as provided in subsection (2). The state treasurer shall credit to the fund all money received for that purpose under section 320e, and as otherwise provided by law. The state treasurer shall invest money in the fund in the same manner as surplus funds are invested under section 143 of 1855 PA 105, MCL 21.143. Earnings from the fund shall be credited to the fund. Money in the fund at the end of the fiscal year shall remain in the fund, and shall not revert to the general fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The department of state police shall administer the fund. Money in the fund shall be used only to administer the fund, to purchase and maintain breath alcohol testing equipment, and to provide training to law enforcement personnel of this state in the use of that breath alcohol testing equipment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The department of treasury shall, before November 1 of each year, notify the department of state police of the balance in the fund at the close of the preceding fiscal year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The department of state police shall promulgate rules to implement subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The drunk driving caseflow assistance fund is created as a separate fund in the state treasury. The purpose of the fund is to promote the timely disposition of cases in which the defendant is charged with a violation of any of the following or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Section 625 or 625m.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Section 80176, 81134, 81135, or 82127 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.80176, 324.81134, 324.81135, and 324.82127.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Money in the fund shall be expended only as provided in subsection (8).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The state treasurer shall credit the drunk driving caseflow assistance fund with deposits of proceeds from the collection of revenue from license reinstatement fees as provided for in section 320e, and all income from investment credited to the fund by the state treasurer. The state treasurer may invest money contained in the drunk driving caseflow assistance fund in any manner authorized by law for the investment of state money. However, an investment shall not interfere with any apportionment, allocation, or payment of money as required by this section. The state treasurer shall credit to the fund all income earned as a result of an investment. Money in the fund at the end of the fiscal year shall remain in the fund and shall not revert to the general fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The state court administrator, at the direction of the supreme court and upon confirmation of the amount by the state treasurer, shall distribute from the drunk driving caseflow assistance fund the total amount available in a fiscal year to each district of the district court and each municipal court as provided in this section. The state court administrator, after reimbursement of costs as provided in this subsection, shall distribute the balance of the drunk driving caseflow assistance fund annually to each district of the district court and each municipal court in an amount determined by multiplying the amount available for distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of cases in which the defendant was charged with a violation enumerated in subsection (5) in the prior calendar year in that district of the district court or that municipal court as certified by the state court administrator and the denominator of which is the total number of cases in all districts of the district court and all municipal courts in which the defendant was charged with a violation enumerated in subsection (5) in the calendar year. The state court administrative office shall be reimbursed annually from the drunk driving caseflow assistance fund for all reasonable costs associated with the administration of this section, including judicial and staff training, on-site management assistance, and software development and conversion.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) Meets the definition in section 20d.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(B) Is set to periodically take samples while the vehicle is in operation. After the vehicle is in operation, the device requires a first retest sample within 5 to 15 minutes of the operator starting the vehicle. The device prompts second and subsequent retests within 15 to 45 minutes of the first retest. The operator of the vehicle is afforded not more than 5 minutes to provide a passing retest sample for each retest prompted by the device. The device accepts multiple attempts to provide a retest sample without initiating a lockout. If the device detects an alcohol content of 0.025 grams or more per 210 liters of breath in the person who offers a breath sample or if a breath sample is not given within the allotted time the device does all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(I) Emits a visible or audible warning signal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(II) Renders the vehicle inoperable as soon as the vehicle is no longer being operated, requiring the operator to provide a breath sample containing a breath alcohol level of less than 0.025 grams per 210 liters of breath before the vehicle may be restarted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(III) Disables the free restart as defined by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration standards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(IV) Activates a violation reset. The device initiates an audible or visual cue that warns the driver that the device will enter a permanent lockout in 5 days.</div>

A manufacturer may request a waiver of this requirement from the secretary of state if the manufacturer is unable to secure an installation facility within 50 miles of any location in this state. Subject to review, the secretary of state may determine whether the manufacturer's waiver request shall be approved. The secretary of state shall only approve a waiver of the 50-mile requirement and designate a location not meeting the 50-mile requirement as a service center if the service center employs a BAIID certified installer who shall perform any installation or service to a BAIID at that location. If the secretary of state approves a waiver of the 50-mile requirement, that waiver applies only to the approved location. A manufacturer shall make a separate request for a waiver of the 50-mile requirement for any additional installation facility not meeting the 50-mile requirement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Agrees to provide an ignition interlock device without cost to a person whose gross income for the immediately preceding tax year based on his or her state income tax return was less than 150% of the official poverty line for that same tax year established in the poverty guidelines issued by the secretary of health and human services under 42 USC 9902. A person in whose vehicle an ignition interlock device is installed without cost under this subdivision shall pay a maintenance fee to the installer of not more than $2.00 per day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Agrees to comply with the reporting requirements of the secretary of state.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A manufacturer that has made a filing under subsection (5) shall immediately notify the department if the device no longer meets the requirements of subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Upon the request of the department, the BAIID manufacturer shall, at no cost to this state, provide the department with not less than 2 BAIIDs for each model that is certified under this section for demonstration and training purposes by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Upon the request of the department, the BAIID manufacturer shall, at no cost to this state, install 1 of each device that is certified under this section in a vehicle provided by the department. Any service performed under this subsection, including, but not limited to, installation, maintenance, calibration, or removal, shall be completed at no cost to this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Upon the request of the department, for each BAIID model approved by the department, the BAIID manufacturer shall provide a total of not less than 10 hours of training to department employees at no cost to this state. This training shall be held at the times and locations within the state designated by the department.

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>257.625n Forfeiture of vehicle or return to lessor.</B><P>Sec. 625n.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section and section 304 and in addition to any other penalty provided for in this act, the judgment of sentence for a conviction for a violation of section 625(1) described in section 625(9)(b) or (c), a violation of section 625(3) described in section 625(11)(b) or (c), a violation of section 625(4), (5), or (7), or a violation of section 904(4) or (5), or, beginning October 31, 2010, a violation of section 626(3) or (4), may require 1 of the following with regard to the vehicle used in the offense if the defendant owns the vehicle in whole or in part or leases the vehicle:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Forfeiture of the vehicle if the defendant owns the vehicle in whole or in part.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Return of the vehicle to the lessor if the defendant leases the vehicle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The vehicle may be seized under a seizure order issued by the court having jurisdiction upon a showing of probable cause that the vehicle is subject to forfeiture or return to the lessor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The forfeiture of a vehicle is subject to the interest of the holder of a security interest who did not have prior knowledge of or consent to the violation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Within 14 days after the defendant's conviction for a violation described in subsection (1), the prosecuting attorney may file a petition with the court for the forfeiture of the vehicle or to have the court order return of a leased vehicle to the lessor. The prosecuting attorney shall give notice by first-class mail or other process to the defendant and his or her attorney, to all owners of the vehicle, and to any person holding a security interest in the vehicle that the court may require forfeiture or return of the vehicle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a vehicle is seized before disposition of the criminal proceedings, a defendant who is an owner or lessee of the vehicle may move the court having jurisdiction over the proceedings to require the seizing agency to file a lien against the vehicle and to return the vehicle to the owner or lessee pending disposition of the criminal proceedings. The court shall hear the motion within 7 days after the motion is filed. If the defendant establishes at the hearing that he or she holds the legal title to the vehicle or that he or she has a leasehold interest and that it is necessary for him or her or a member of his or her family to use the vehicle pending the outcome of the forfeiture action, the court may order the seizing agency to return the vehicle to the owner or lessee. If the court orders the return of the vehicle to the owner or lessee, the court shall order the defendant to post a bond in an amount equal to the retail value of the vehicle, and shall also order the seizing agency to file a lien against the vehicle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Within 14 days after notice by the prosecuting attorney is given under subsection (4), the defendant, an owner, lessee, or holder of a security interest may file a claim of interest in the vehicle with the court. Within 21 days after the expiration of the period for filing claims, but before or at sentencing, the court shall hold a hearing to determine the legitimacy of any claim, the extent of any co-owner's equity interest, the liability of the defendant to any co-lessee, and whether to order the vehicle forfeited or returned to the lessor. In considering whether to order forfeiture, the court shall review the defendant's driving record to determine whether the defendant has multiple convictions under section 625 or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to section 625, or multiple suspensions, restrictions, or denials under section 904, or both. If the defendant has multiple convictions under section 625 or multiple suspensions, restrictions, or denials under section 904, or both, that factor shall weigh heavily in favor of forfeiture.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a vehicle is forfeited under this section, the unit of government that seized the vehicle shall sell the vehicle pursuant to the procedures under section 252g(1) and dispose of the proceeds in the following order of priority:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Pay any outstanding security interest of a secured party who did not have prior knowledge of or consent to the commission of the violation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Pay the equity interest of a co-owner who did not have prior knowledge of or consent to the commission of the violation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Satisfy any order of restitution entered in the prosecution for the violation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Pay any outstanding accrued towing and storage fees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Pay the claim of each person who shows that he or she is a victim of the violation to the extent that the claim is not covered by an order of restitution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Pay any outstanding lien against the property that has been imposed by a governmental unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Pay the proper expenses of the proceedings for forfeiture and sale, including, but not limited to, expenses incurred during the seizure process and expenses for maintaining custody of the property, advertising, and court costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The balance remaining after the payment of items (a) through (g) shall be distributed by the court having jurisdiction over the forfeiture proceedings to the unit or units of government substantially involved in effecting the forfeiture. Seventy-five percent of the money received by a unit of government under this subdivision shall be used to enhance enforcement of the criminal laws and 25% of the money shall be used to implement the William Van Regenmorter crime victim's rights act, 1985 PA 87, MCL 780.751 to 780.834. A unit of government receiving money under this subdivision shall report annually to the department of management and budget the amount of money received under this subdivision that was used to enhance enforcement of the criminal laws and the amount that was used to implement the William Van Regenmorter crime victim's rights act, 1985 PA 87, MCL 780.751 to 780.834.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The court may order the defendant to pay to a co-lessee any liability determined under subsection (6). The order may be enforced in the same manner as a civil judgment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The return of a vehicle to the lessor under this section does not affect or impair the lessor's rights or the defendant's obligations under the lease.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A person who knowingly conceals, sells, gives away, or otherwise transfers or disposes of a vehicle with the intent to avoid forfeiture or return of the vehicle to the lessor under this section is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 1 year or a fine of not more than $1,000.00, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The failure of the court or prosecutor to comply with any time limit specified in this section does not preclude the court from ordering forfeiture of a vehicle or its return to a lessor, unless the court finds that the owner or claimant suffered substantial prejudice as a result of that failure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The forfeiture provisions of this section do not preclude the prosecuting attorney from pursuing a forfeiture proceeding under any other law of this state or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to this section.</div>

The state transportation department, county road commission, or local authority may decrease the speed limit in a hospital highway zone by more than 10 miles per hour if the decrease is supported by an engineering and safety study. The state transportation department, county road commission, or local authority shall post speed limit signs in a hospital highway zone that indicate the speed limit in that hospital highway zone and shall identify that hospital highway zone with any other traffic control devices necessary to conform to the Michigan manual on uniform traffic control devices. If a change in a sign, signal, or device, is necessitated by a speed limit decrease described in this subsection, the hospital requesting the decrease shall pay the cost of doing so. As used in this subsection, "hospital highway zone" means a portion of state trunk line highway maintained by the state transportation department that has a posted speed limit of at least 50 miles per hour and has 2 or fewer lanes for travel in the same direction, traverses along property owned by a hospital, contains an ingress and egress point from hospital property, and extends not more than 1,000 feet beyond the boundary lines of hospital property in both directions in a municipality.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Subject to subsection (17), the maximum speed limit on all limited access freeways upon which a speed limit is not otherwise fixed under this act is 70 miles per hour, which shall be known as the "limited access freeway general speed limit". The minimum speed limit on all limited access freeways upon which a minimum speed limit is not otherwise fixed under this act is 55 miles per hour.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Subject to subsection (17), the speed limit on all trunk line highways and all county highways upon which a speed limit is not otherwise fixed under this act is 55 miles per hour, which shall be known as the "general speed limit".</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the speed limit on all county highways with a gravel or unimproved surface upon which a speed limit is not otherwise fixed under this act is 55 miles per hour, which shall be known as the "general gravel road speed limit". Upon request of a municipality located within a county with a population of 1,000,000 or more, the county road commission, in conjunction with the requesting municipality, may lower the speed limit to 45 miles per hour on the requested road segment and if a sign, signal, or device is erected or maintained, taken down, or regulated as a result of a request by a municipality for a speed limit of 45 miles per hour, the municipality shall pay the costs of doing so. If a municipality located within a county with a population of 1,000,000 or more requests a speed different than the speed described in this subsection, the county road commission, in conjunction with the department of state police and the requesting municipality, may conduct a speed study of free-flow traffic on the fastest portion of the road segment in question for the purpose of establishing a modified speed limit. A speed study conducted under this subsection must be completed between 3 and 14 days after a full gravel road maintenance protocol has been performed on the road segment. A full gravel road maintenance protocol described in this subsection must include road grading and the application of a dust abatement chemical treatment. Following a speed study conducted under this subsection, the speed limit for the road segment must be established at the nearest multiple of 5 miles per hour to the eighty-fifth percentile of speed of free-flow traffic under ideal conditions for vehicular traffic, and must not be set below the fiftieth percentile speed of free-flow traffic under ideal conditions for vehicular traffic. A speed study conducted under this subsection is the responsibility of the department of state police, and if a sign, signal, or device is erected or maintained, taken down, or regulated as a result of a request by a municipality under this subsection, the municipality shall pay the costs of doing so.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A public record of all traffic control orders establishing statutory speed limits authorized under this section must be filed with the office of the clerk of the county in which the county highway is located or at the office of the city or village clerk or administrative office of the airport, college, or university in which the local highway is located, and a certified copy of the traffic control order is evidence in every court of this state of the authority for the issuance of that traffic control order. The public record filed with the county, city, or village clerk or administrative office of the airport, college, or university must not be required as evidence of authority for issuing a traffic control order in the case of signs temporarily erected or placed at points where construction, maintenance, or surveying activities is in progress. A traffic and engineering investigation is not required for a traffic control order for a speed limit established under subsection (2). A traffic control order must, at a minimum, contain all of the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The name of the road.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The boundaries of the segment of the road on which the speed limit is in effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The basis on which the speed limit is in effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The section of law, including a reference to the subsection, under which the speed limit is established.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Except for speed limits described in subsections (1), (2)(d), (2)(e), and (9), speed limits established under this section are not valid unless properly posted. In the absence of a properly posted sign, the speed limit in effect is the basic speed law described in subsection (1). Speed limits established under subsection (2)(b), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j) are not valid unless a traffic control order is filed as described in subsection (11).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Nothing in this section prevents the establishment of a modified speed limit after a speed study as described in section 628. A modified speed limit established under section 628 supersedes a speed limit established under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) All signs erected or placed under this section must conform to the Michigan manual on uniform traffic control devices.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) If upon investigation the state transportation department or county road commission and the department of state police determine that it is in the interest of public safety, they may order city, village, airport, college, university, and township officials to erect and maintain, take down, or regulate speed limit signs, signals, and devices as directed. In default of an order, the state transportation department or county road commission may cause designated signs, signals, and devices to be erected and maintained, removed, or regulated in the manner previously directed and pay the costs for doing so out of the designated highway fund. An investigation, including a speed study, conducted under this subsection is the responsibility of the department of state police.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) An individual who violates a speed limit established under this section is responsible for a civil infraction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) No later than January 5, 2018, the state transportation department and the department of state police shall increase the speed limits on at least 600 miles of limited access freeway to 75 miles per hour if an engineering and safety study and the eighty-fifth percentile speed of free-flowing traffic under ideal conditions of that section contain findings that the speed limit may be raised to that speed, and the department shall increase the speed limit of 900 miles of trunk line highway to 65 miles per hour if an engineering and safety study and the eighty-fifth percentile speed of free-flowing traffic under ideal conditions of that section contain findings that the speed limit may be raised to that speed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Traffic control order" means a document filed with the proper authority that establishes the legal and enforceable speed limit for the highway segment described in the document.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The department of state police or the state transportation department; the county board of commissioners, board of county road commissioners, or county sheriff; or other local authority having jurisdiction over a highway or street may authorize the installation and use of unmanned traffic monitoring devices at a railroad grade crossing with flashing signals and gates on a highway or street under their respective jurisdictions. Each device shall be sufficiently marked or identified or a sign shall be placed at the approach to the crossing indicating that the crossing is monitored by an unmanned traffic monitoring device.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Beginning 31 days after the installation of an unmanned traffic monitoring device at a railroad grade crossing described in subsection (1), a person is responsible for a civil infraction as provided in section 667 if the person violates a provision of that section on the basis of evidence obtained from an unmanned traffic monitoring device. However, for the first 30 days after the installation of an unmanned traffic monitoring device, a person shall be issued a written warning only. It is an affirmative defense to a charge of violating section 667 that the mechanical warning devices at the crossing were malfunctioning.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A sworn statement of a police officer from the state or local authority having jurisdiction over the highway or street upon which the railroad grade crossing described in subsection (1) is located, based upon inspection of photographs, microphotographs, videotape, or other recorded images produced by an unmanned traffic monitoring device, is prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein. Any photographs, microphotographs, videotape, or other recorded images indicating such a violation shall be available for inspection in any proceeding to adjudicate the responsibility for a violation of section 667. Any photographs, videotape, or digital images of the violation shall be destroyed 90 days after final disposition of the citation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In a prosecution for a violation of section 667 established by an unmanned traffic monitoring device under this section, prima facie evidence that the vehicle described in the citation issued was operated in violation of section 667, together with proof that the defendant was at the time of the violation the registered owner of the vehicle, shall constitute in evidence a rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person who committed the violation. The presumption is rebutted if the registered owner of the vehicle files an affidavit by regular mail with the clerk of the court that he or she was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation or testifies in open court under oath that he or she was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. The presumption also is rebutted if a certified copy of a police report, showing that the vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen before the time of the alleged violation of this section, is presented before the appearance date established on the citation. For purposes of this subsection, the owner of a leased or rental vehicle shall provide the name and address of the person to whom the vehicle was leased or rented at the time of the violation.</div>

If the summoned person fails to appear on the date of return set out in the citation previously mailed by first-class mail under this subsection, a copy shall be sent by certified mail-return receipt requested. If the summoned person fails to appear on either of the dates of return set out in the copies of the citation mailed under this section, the citation shall be executed in the manner provided by law for personal service. The court may issue a warrant for the arrest of a person who fails to appear within the time limit established on the citation if a sworn complaint is filed with the court for that purpose. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If there is a fatality resulting from a train-vehicle crash at a public railroad grade crossing, the state transportation department shall convene a diagnostic study team review, if there has not been a diagnostic study team review at the crossing in the last 2 years. However, a diagnostic study team review is not required if the initial law enforcement investigation of the fatality indicates that the motorist's consumption of alcohol or a controlled substance or his or her disregard of an existing traffic control device conveying a "stop" message contributed to the fatality, or that the fatality was a suicide. The diagnostic study team review shall be conducted within 120 days after the state transportation department is made aware of the fatality. If the diagnostic study team review reaches consensus that warning device enhancements are needed, the state transportation department shall order those improvements. The cost for the improvements shall be financed consistent with the financing of similar projects by the state transportation department according to its annual prioritization of grade crossing safety improvements.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The state transportation department with respect to highways under its jurisdiction and the county road commissions and local authorities with respect to highways under their jurisdiction may designate certain grade crossings of railways by highways as "stop" crossings, and erect signs at the crossings notifying drivers of vehicles upon the highway to come to a complete stop before crossing the railway tracks. When a crossing is designated and signposted as provided in this subsection, the driver of a vehicle shall stop not more than 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the railway tracks. The driver shall then traverse the crossing when it may be done in safety.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The state transportation department with respect to highways under its jurisdiction and the county road commissions and local authorities with respect to highways under their jurisdiction may designate certain grade crossings of railways by highways as yield crossings, and erect signs at the crossings notifying drivers of vehicles upon the highway to yield. Yield signs may be mounted on the same post as the crossbuck sign. Drivers of vehicles approaching a yield sign at the grade crossing of a railway shall maintain a reasonable speed based upon existing conditions and shall yield the right-of-way. The cost of yield sign installations shall be borne equally by the railroad and the governmental authority under whose jurisdiction the highway rests.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section and this chapter, a vehicle stopped or parked upon a highway or street shall be stopped or parked with the wheels of the vehicle parallel to the roadway and within 12 inches of any curb existing at the right of the vehicle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A local authority may by ordinance permit parking of a vehicle on a 1-way roadway with the vehicle's left wheels adjacent to and within 12 inches of any curb existing at the left of the vehicle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A local authority may by ordinance permit angle parking on a roadway, except that angle parking is not permitted on a state trunk line highway unless authorized by the state transportation department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The state transportation commission with respect to state trunk line highways and a board of county road commissioners with respect to county roads, acting jointly with the director of the department of state police, may place signs prohibiting or restricting the stopping, standing, or parking of vehicles on a highway where, in the opinion of the officials as determined by an engineering survey, the stopping, standing, or parking is dangerous to those using the highway or where the stopping, standing, or parking of vehicles would unduly interfere with the free movement of traffic on the highway or street. The signs shall be official signs and a person shall not stop, stand, or park a vehicle in violation of the restrictions stated on the signs. The signs shall be installed only after a proper traffic order is filed with the county clerk. Upon the application to the state transportation commission by a home rule city affected by an order, opportunity shall be given to the city for a hearing before the state transportation commission, under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, except when an ordinance of the home rule city prohibits or restricts the parking of vehicles on a state trunk line highway; when the home rule city, by lawfully authorized official action, requests the state transportation department to prohibit or restrict parking on a state trunk line highway; or when the home rule city enters into a construction agreement with the state transportation department providing for the prohibition or restriction of parking on a state trunk line highway during or after the period of construction. Traffic control orders, so long as they affect parking upon a state trunk line highway within the corporate limits of a home rule city, are considered "rules" within the meaning of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, and upon application for a hearing by a home rule city, the proceedings before the state transportation commission shall be considered a "contested case" within the meaning of that act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A disabled person may apply, on a form prescribed by the secretary of state, for a serially numbered nontransferable temporary or permanent windshield placard for the personal use of the disabled person. An individual who has a religious objection to having a medical examination may personally apply at a branch office of the secretary of state for a serially numbered nontransferable temporary or permanent windshield placard for the personal use of the disabled individual. If it appears obvious that the individual has a qualifying disability, the individual is not required to present a medical statement attesting to the disability. The application for and the issuance of the serially numbered nontransferable temporary or permanent windshield placard is subject to all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The secretary of state may issue to a disabled person with a temporary disability a temporary windshield placard that is valid for a period of not more than 6 months.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The secretary of state may issue to a disabled person with a permanent disability an original or renewal permanent windshield placard that is valid for a period of not more than 4 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An original or permanent windshield placard expires on the disabled person's fifth birthday after the date of issuance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A renewal permanent windshield placard expires on the disabled person's fourth birthday after the date of renewal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, not more than 45 days immediately preceding the expiration of his or her certificate or placard, a person holding a permanent windshield placard may apply for a new or renewal placard as provided in this section. However, if the person will be out of state during the 45 days immediately preceding expiration of the placard or for other good cause shown cannot apply for a placard within the 45-day period, the person may apply for a new or renewal placard not more than 6 months before the placard expires. A placard issued or renewed under this subdivision expires as provided in this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Upon application in the manner prescribed by the secretary of state for replacement of a lost, stolen, or destroyed placard described in this section, a disabled person or organization that provides specialized services to disabled persons may be issued a placard that in substance duplicates the original certificate or placard for a fee of $10.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) A placard described in this section may be used by a person other than the disabled person for the sole purpose of transporting the disabled person. An organization that provides specialized services to disabled persons may apply for and receive a permanent windshield placard to be used in any motor vehicle actually transporting a disabled person. If the organization ceases to transport disabled persons, the placard shall be returned to the secretary of state for cancellation and destruction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The secretary of state shall not issue a permanent placard to an individual under this section unless that individual has provided proof of Michigan residency.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (20), an application for an initial free parking sticker shall contain a certification by a physician, physician assistant, certified nurse practitioner, or physical therapist licensed to practice in this state attesting to the nature and estimated duration of the applicant's disabling condition and verifying that the applicant qualifies for a free parking sticker. An individual who has a religious objection to having a medical examination may personally apply at a branch office of the secretary of state for an initial free parking sticker. If it appears obvious that the individual is unable to do 1 or more of the acts listed in subdivisions (a) to (d), the individual is not required to present a certification by a physician, a physician assistant, a certified nurse practitioner, or a physical therapist attesting to the nature and estimated duration of the applicant's disabling condition or verifying that the applicant qualifies for a free parking sticker. The applicant qualifies for a free parking sticker if the applicant is a licensed driver and the physician, physician assistant, certified nurse practitioner, or physical therapist certifies or, if an individual is not required to have a certification by a physician, a physician assistant, a certified nurse practitioner, or a physical therapist, it is obvious that the applicant is unable to do 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Manage, manipulate, or insert coins, or obtain tickets or tokens in parking meters or ticket machines in parking lots or parking structures, due to the lack of fine motor control of both hands.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A windshield placard bearing a free parking sticker issued under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A valid windshield placard issued by another state.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A license plate for persons with disabilities issued by another state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A special registration plate with a tab for persons with disabilities attached issued by another state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A vehicle that does not properly display 1 of the items listed in subsection (8) is not entitled to free parking in a metered parking space or in a publicly owned parking area or structure, and the disabled person or vehicle operator shall pay all parking fees and may be responsible for a civil infraction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Blindness that is not accompanied by an incapacity described in subsection (7) does not entitle a person to a free parking sticker.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The secretary of state shall attach a free parking sticker, in contrasting colors, to the windshield placard of a person certified as having an incapacity described in subsection (7).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A windshield placard issued under this section shall be displayed on the interior rearview mirror of the vehicle or, if there is no interior rearview mirror, on the lower left corner of the dashboard while the vehicle is parked or being parked by or under the direction of a disabled person pursuant to this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Upon conviction of an offense involving a violation of the special privileges conferred upon a holder of a windshield placard or free parking sticker, a magistrate or judge trying the case, as a part of any penalty imposed, may confiscate the windshield placard or free parking sticker and return the confiscated item or items to the secretary of state together with a certified copy of the sentence imposed.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Brake equipment shall be required as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A motor vehicle, other than a motorcycle or moped, and a low-speed vehicle when operated upon a highway shall be equipped with brakes adequate to control the movement of and to stop and hold the vehicle, including 2 separate means of applying the brakes, each of which means shall be effective to apply the brakes to at least 2 wheels. If these 2 separate means of applying the brakes are connected in any way, they shall be constructed in a way that failure of 1 part of the operating mechanism shall not leave the motor vehicle without brakes on at least 2 wheels.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A motorcycle or moped when operated upon a highway shall be equipped with at least 2 brakes, 1 on the front wheel and 1 on the rear wheel, that may be operated by hand or foot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A trailer or semitrailer of a gross weight of 15,001 pounds or more when operated upon a highway shall be equipped with brakes operating on all wheels and designed to be applied by the driver of the towing motor vehicle from its cab.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A new motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer sold in this state and operated upon the highways shall be equipped with brakes on all wheels, except a motorcycle or moped, and except that a semitrailer, pole trailer, or trailer of less than 3,000 pounds gross weight need not be equipped with brakes if the gross weight of a trailer or pole trailer, no part of the load of which rests upon the towing vehicle, does not exceed 40% of the gross weight of the towing vehicle, and if the gross weight of the towing vehicle and the gross weight of a semitrailer or pole trailer, part of the load of which rests upon the towing vehicle, does not exceed 40% of the gross weight of the towing vehicle when connected to the semitrailer or pole trailer. This subdivision does not apply to a trailer or semitrailer owned by a farmer and used exclusively in connection with the farming operations of the farmer and not used for hire.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Every bus, school bus, truck, or truck tractor shall be equipped with brakes operating on all wheels, except that a truck or truck tractor that has 3 or more axles need not have brakes on the front wheels if the vehicle was manufactured before July 25, 1980.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) In any combination of motor driven vehicles, means shall be provided for applying the rearmost trailer brakes, for a trailer equipped with brakes, in approximate synchronism with the brakes on the towing vehicle and developing the required braking effort on the rearmost wheels at the fastest rate; or means shall be provided for applying braking effort first on the rearmost trailer equipped with brakes; or both of the above means capable of being used alternatively may be employed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) A motor vehicle and combination of vehicles, except pole trailers, motorcycles, and mopeds, shall be equipped with parking brakes adequate to hold the vehicle on any grade on which it is operated, under all conditions of loading on a surface free from snow, ice, or loose material. The parking brakes shall be capable of being applied in conformance with the foregoing requirements by the driver's muscular effort or by spring action or by equivalent means. Their operation may be assisted by the service brakes or other source of power if failure of the service brake actuation system or other power assisting mechanism will not prevent the parking brakes from being applied in conformance with the foregoing requirements. The parking brakes shall be designed in a manner that when once applied they shall remain applied with the required effectiveness despite exhaustion of any source of energy or leakage of any kind. The same brake drums, brake shoes, and lining assemblies, brake shoe anchors, and mechanical brake shoe actuation mechanism normally associated with the wheel brake assemblies may be used for both the service brakes and the parking brakes. If the means of applying the parking brakes and the service brakes are connected in any way, they shall be constructed in a manner that failure of 1 part shall not leave the vehicle without operative brakes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The brake shoes operating within or upon the drums of the vehicle wheels of a motor vehicle may be used for both service and hand operation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A motor vehicle or combination of motor-drawn vehicles shall be capable at all times and under all conditions of loading, of being stopped on a dry, smooth, level road free from loose material within the distances specified in this subsection, or shall be capable of being decelerated at a sustained rate corresponding to these distances upon initial application of the service (foot) brake.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the axles are spaced less than 3-1/2 feet apart, the maximum axle load shall not exceed 9,000 pounds per axle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) shall be known as the normal loading maximum.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) When normal loading is in effect, the state transportation department, or a local authority with respect to highways under its jurisdiction, may designate certain highways, or sections of those highways, where bridges and road surfaces are adequate for heavier loading, and revise a designation as needed, on which the maximum tandem axle assembly loading shall not exceed 16,000 pounds for any axle of the assembly, if there is no other axle within 9 feet of any axle of the assembly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A combination of vehicles may operate on designated highways with not more than 1 tandem axle assembly having a gross weight of 16,000 pounds per axle, if there is no other axle within 9 feet of the assembly. On a combination of truck tractor and semitrailer having not more than 5 axles, 2 consecutive tandem axle assemblies may operate on designated highways at a gross permissible weight of 16,000 pounds per axle, if there is no other axle within 9 feet of any axle of either assembly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Notwithstanding subsection (3), on a combination of truck tractor and semitrailer having not more than 5 axles, 2 consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross permissible weight of not to exceed 17,000 pounds on any axle of the tandem axles if there is no other axle within 9 feet of any axle of the tandem axles and if the first and last axles of the consecutive sets of tandem axles are not less than 36 feet apart and the gross vehicle weight does not exceed 80,000 pounds to pick up and deliver agricultural commodities between the national truck network or special designated highways and any other highway. This subsection is not subject to the maximum axle loads of subsections (1), (2), and (3). For purposes of this subsection, a "tandem axle" means 2 axles spaced more than 40 inches but not more than 96 inches apart or 2 axles spaced more than 3-1/2 feet but less than 9 feet apart. This subsection does not apply during that period when reduced maximum loads are in effect under subsection (8). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The seasonal reductions described under subsection (8) to the loading maximums and gross vehicle weight requirement of subsection (12) do not apply to a person hauling agricultural commodities if the person who picks up or delivers the agricultural commodity either from a farm or to a farm notifies the county road commission for roads under its authority not less than 48 hours before the pickup or delivery of the time and location of the pickup or delivery. The county road commission shall issue a permit to the person and charge a fee that does not exceed the administrative costs incurred. The permit shall contain all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The designated route or routes of travel for the load.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The date and time period requested by the person who picks up or delivers the agricultural commodities during which the load may be delivered or picked up.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A maximum speed limit of travel, if necessary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Any other specific conditions agreed to between the parties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The seasonal reductions described under subsection (8) to the loading maximums and gross vehicle weight requirements of subsection (12) do not apply to public utility vehicles under the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For emergency public utility work on restricted roads, as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If required by the county road commission, the public utility or its subcontractor shall notify the county road commission, as soon as practical, of the location of the emergency public utility work and provide a statement that the vehicles that were used to perform the emergency utility work may have exceeded the loading maximums and gross vehicle weight requirements of subsection (12) as reduced under subsection (8). The notification may be made via facsimile or electronically.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The public utility vehicle travels to and from the site of the emergency public utility work while on a restricted road at a speed not greater than 35 miles per hour.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For nonemergency public utility work on restricted roads, as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) If the county road commission requires, the public utility or its subcontractor shall apply to the county road commission annually for a seasonal truck permit for roads under its authority before seasonal weight restrictions are effective. The county road commission shall issue a seasonal truck permit for each public utility vehicle or vehicle configuration the public utility or subcontractor anticipates will be utilized for nonemergency public utility work. The county road commission may charge a fee for a seasonal truck permit that does not exceed the administrative costs incurred for the permit. The seasonal truck permit shall contain all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(A) The seasonal period requested by the public utility or subcontractor during which the permit is valid.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Except as provided in this subsection and subsection (9), during the months of March, April, and May in each year, the maximum axle load allowable on concrete pavements or pavements with a concrete base is reduced by 25% from the maximum axle load as specified in this chapter, and the maximum axle loads allowable on all other types of roads during these months are reduced by 35% from the maximum axle loads as specified. The maximum wheel load shall not exceed 525 pounds per inch of tire width on concrete and concrete base or 450 pounds per inch of tire width on all other roads during the period the seasonal road restrictions are in effect. Subject to subsection (5), this subsection does not apply to vehicles transporting agricultural commodities or, subject to subsection (6), public utility vehicles on a highway, road, or street under the jurisdiction of a local road agency, or a school bus. In addition, this subsection does not apply to a vehicle delivering propane fuel to a residence if the vehicle's propane tank is filled to not more than 50% of its capacity and the vehicle is traveling at not more than 35 miles per hour. The state transportation department and each local authority with highways and streets under its jurisdiction to which the seasonal restrictions prescribed under this subsection apply shall post all of the following information on the homepage of its website or, if a local authority does not have a website, then on the website of a statewide road association of which it is a member:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The dates when the seasonal restrictions are in effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The names of the highways and streets and portions of highways and streets to which the seasonal restrictions apply.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The state transportation department for roads under its jurisdiction and a county road commission for roads under its jurisdiction may grant exemptions from seasonal weight restrictions for milk on specified routes when requested in writing. Approval or denial of a request for an exemption shall be given by written notice to the applicant within 30 days after the date of submission of the application. If a request is denied, the written notice shall state the reason for denial and alternate routes for which the permit may be issued. The applicant may appeal to the state transportation commission or the county road commission. These exemptions do not apply on county roads in counties that have negotiated agreements with milk haulers or haulers of other commodities during periods of seasonal load limits before April 14, 1993. This subsection does not limit the ability of these counties to continue to negotiate such agreements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The state transportation department, or a local authority with respect to highways under its jurisdiction, may suspend the restrictions imposed by this section when and where conditions of the highways or the public health, safety, and welfare warrant suspension, and impose the restricted loading requirements of this section on designated highways at any other time that the conditions of the highway require.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) For the purpose of enforcing this act, the gross vehicle weight of a single vehicle and load or a combination of vehicles and loads shall be determined by weighing individual axles or groups of axles, and the total weight on all the axles shall be the gross vehicle weight. In addition, the gross axle weight shall be determined by weighing individual axles or by weighing a group of axles and dividing the gross weight of the group of axles by the number of axles in the group. For purposes of subsection (12), the overall gross weight on a group of 2 or more axles shall be determined by weighing individual axles or several axles, and the total weight of all the axles in the group shall be the overall gross weight of the group.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The loading maximum in this subsection applies to interstate highways, and the state transportation department, or a local authority with respect to highways under its jurisdiction, may designate a highway, or a section of a highway, for the operation of vehicles having a gross vehicle weight of not more than 80,000 pounds that are subject to the following load maximums:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Twenty thousand pounds on any 1 axle, including all enforcement tolerances.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A tandem axle weight of 34,000 pounds, including all enforcement tolerances.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An overall gross weight on a group of 2 or more consecutive axles equaling:
<B></B><table>
    <tr>
      <td>W=500[(LN)/(N-1)+12N+36]</td>
    </tr>
  </table><B></B>where W = overall gross weight on a group of 2 or more consecutive axles to the nearest 500 pounds, L = distance in feet between the extreme of a group of 2 or more consecutive axles, and N = number of axles in the group under consideration; except that 2 consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross load of 34,000 pounds each if the first and last axles of the consecutive sets of tandem axles are not less than 36 feet apart. The gross vehicle weight shall not exceed 80,000 pounds including all enforcement tolerances. Except for 5 axle truck tractor, semitrailer combinations having 2 consecutive sets of tandem axles, vehicles having a gross weight in excess of 80,000 pounds or in excess of the vehicle gross weight determined by application of the formula in this subsection are subject to the maximum axle loads of subsections (1), (2), and (3). As used in this subsection, "tandem axle weight" means the total weight transmitted to the road by 2 or more consecutive axles, the centers of which may be included between parallel transverse vertical planes spaced more than 40 inches but not more than 96 inches apart, extending across the full width of the vehicle. Except as otherwise provided in this section, vehicles transporting agricultural commodities shall have weight load maximums as set forth in this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The axle loading maximums under subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4) are increased by 10% for vehicles transporting agricultural commodities or raw timber, excluding farm equipment and fuel, from the place of harvest or farm storage to the first point of delivery on a road in this state. However, the axle loading maximums as increased under this subsection do not alter the gross vehicle weight restrictions set forth in this act. This subsection does not apply to either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A vehicle utilizing an interstate highway.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A vehicle utilizing a road that is subject to seasonal weight restrictions under subsection (8) during the time that the seasonal weight restrictions are in effect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a vehicle that has a gross weight of 80,000 pounds or less and that is operated by an engine that is fueled wholly or partially by compressed or liquefied natural gas may exceed the axle loading maximums under subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4) and the weight load maximums under subsection (12) by an amount equal to the difference between the weight of the vehicle attributable to the natural gas tank and fueling system carried by that vehicle and the weight of a comparable diesel tank and fueling system. The amount by which a vehicle described in this subsection may exceed the axle loading maximums under subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4) and the weight load maximums under subsection (12) shall not exceed 2,000 pounds.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) As used in this section: </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A police officer, a peace officer, or an authorized agent of the state transportation department or a county road commission having reason to believe that the weight of a vehicle and load is unlawful may require the driver to stop and submit to a weighing of the vehicle by either portable or stationary scales approved and sealed as a legal weighing device by a qualified person using testing equipment certified or approved by the department of agriculture and rural development as a legal weighing device and may require that the vehicle be driven to the nearest weigh station of the state transportation department for the purpose of allowing a police officer, peace officer, or agent of the state transportation department or county road commission to determine whether the vehicle is loaded in conformity with this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) When the officer or agent, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that the weight is unlawful, the officer or agent may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable place and remain standing until that portion of the load is shifted or removed as necessary to reduce the gross axle load weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted under this chapter. All material unloaded as provided under this subsection shall be cared for by the owner or operator of the vehicle at the risk of the owner or operator. A judge or magistrate imposing a civil fine and costs under this section that are not paid in full immediately or for which a bond is not immediately posted in the amount of the civil fine and costs shall order the driver or owner to move the vehicle at the driver's own risk to a place of safekeeping within the jurisdiction of the judge or magistrate, inform the judge or magistrate in writing of the place of safekeeping, and keep the vehicle until the fine and costs are paid or sufficient bond is furnished or until the judge or magistrate is satisfied that the fine and costs will be paid. The officer or agent who has determined, after weighing a vehicle and load, that the weight is unlawful, may require the driver to proceed to a judge or magistrate within the county. If the judge or magistrate is satisfied that the probable civil fine and costs will be paid by the owner or lessee, the judge or magistrate may allow the driver to proceed, after the load is made legal. If the judge or magistrate is not satisfied that the owner or lessee, after a notice and a right to be heard on the merits is given, will pay the amount of the probable civil fine and costs, the judge or magistrate may order the vehicle to be impounded until trial on the merits is completed under conditions set forth in this section for the impounding of vehicles after the civil fine and costs have been imposed. Removal of the vehicle, and forwarding, care, or preservation of the load shall be under the control of and at the risk of the owner or driver. Vehicles impounded are subject to a lien, subject to a prior valid bona fide lien of prior record, in the amount of the civil fine and costs and if the civil fine and costs are not paid within 90 days after the seizure, the judge or magistrate must certify the unpaid judgment to the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the violation occurred, who shall proceed to enforce the lien by foreclosure sale in accordance with procedure authorized in the case of chattel mortgage foreclosures. When the duly authorized agent of the state transportation department or county road commission is performing duties under this chapter, the agent has all the powers conferred upon peace officers by the general laws of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Subject to subsection (4), an owner of a vehicle or a lessee of the vehicle of an owner-operator, or other person, who causes or allows a vehicle to be loaded and driven or moved on a highway when the weight of that vehicle violates section 722 is responsible for a civil infraction and must pay a civil fine in an amount equal to 3 cents per pound for each pound of excess load over 1,000 pounds when the excess is 2,000 pounds or less; 6 cents per pound of excess load when the excess is over 2,000 pounds but not over 3,000 pounds; 9 cents per pound for each pound of excess load when the excess is over 3,000 pounds but not over 4,000 pounds; 12 cents per pound for each pound of excess load when the excess is over 4,000 pounds but not over 5,000 pounds; 15 cents per pound for each pound of excess load when the excess is over 5,000 pounds but not over 10,000 pounds; and 20 cents per pound for each pound of excess load when the excess is over 10,000 pounds. If a person operates a vehicle in violation of increased axle loading maximums provided for under section 722(13), the owner or lessee of the vehicle is responsible for a civil infraction and must pay the civil fine under this subsection that applies to the amount of weight by which the vehicle exceeds the original loading maximum.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the court determines that the motor vehicle or the combination of vehicles was operated in violation of this section, the court must impose a fine as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the court determines that the motor vehicle or the combination of vehicles was operated in such a manner that the gross weight of the vehicle or the combination of vehicles would not be lawful by a proper distribution of the load upon all the axles of the vehicle or the combination of vehicles, the court must impose a fine for the violation according to the schedule provided for in subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the court determines that the motor vehicle or the combination of vehicles would be lawful by a proper distribution of the load upon all of the axles of the vehicle or the combination of vehicles, but that 1 or more axles of the vehicle exceeded the maximum allowable axle weight by more than 1,000 pounds but less than 4,000 pounds, the court must impose a misload fine of $200.00 per axle. Not more than 3 axles shall be used in calculating the fine to be imposed under this subdivision. This subdivision does not apply to a vehicle subject to the maximum loading provisions of section 722(12) or to a vehicle for which a fine as calculated under the schedule in subsection (3) would be less than the fine as calculated under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the court determines that the motor vehicle or the combination of vehicles would meet the loading conditions specified in a special permit that was issued under section 725 by a proper distribution of the load upon all of the axles of the vehicle or the combination of vehicles, but that 1 or more axles of the vehicle exceeded the permitted axle weight by 1,000 pounds or less, the court must impose a misload fine of $200.00 per axle. If the court determines that the motor vehicle or the combination of vehicles would meet the loading conditions specified in a special permit that was issued under section 725 by a proper distribution of the load upon all of the axles of the vehicle or the combination of vehicles, but that 1 or more axles of the vehicle exceeded the permitted axle weight by more than 1,000 pounds, the court must impose a fine for the violation according to the schedule provided in subsection (3) for the amount of pounds exceeding the permitted axle weight. Not more than 3 axles shall be used in calculating the fine to be imposed under this subdivision. If the court determines that the load was misloaded, the conditions of the special permit remain valid. The imposition of a fine does not void the special permit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If the court determines that the motor vehicle or the combination of vehicles would be lawful by a proper distribution of the load upon all of the axles of the vehicle or the combination of vehicles, but that 1 or more axles of the vehicle exceeded the permitted axle weight by at least 4,000 pounds but no more than 8,000 pounds, the court must impose a misload fine of $400.00 per axle. Not more than 3 axles shall be used in calculating the fine to be imposed under this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the court determines that the motor vehicle or the combination of vehicles would be lawful by a proper distribution of the load upon all of the axles of the vehicle or the combination of vehicles, but that 1 or more axles of the vehicle exceeded the permitted axle weight by more than 8,000 pounds, the court must impose a fine for the violation according to the schedule provided in subsection (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A driver or owner of a truck or truck tractor, a truck or truck tractor with other vehicles in combination, or any special mobile equipment who fails to stop at or bypasses any scales or weighing station is responsible for a civil infraction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An agent or authorized representative of the state transportation department or a county road commission shall not stop a truck or vehicle in movement upon a road or highway within the state for any purpose, unless the agent or authorized representative is driving a duly marked vehicle, clearly showing and denoting the branch of government represented.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A driver or owner of a vehicle who knowingly fails to stop when requested or ordered to do so and submit to a weighing by a police officer, a peace officer, or an authorized agent of the state transportation department, or a representative or agent of a county road commission, authorized to require the driver to stop and submit to a weighing of the vehicle and load by means of a portable scale, is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 90 days or a fine of not more than $100.00, or both. A driver or person who dumps his or her load when ordered to submit to a weigh or who otherwise attempts to commit or commits an act to avoid a vehicle weigh is in violation of this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Upon receipt of a written application and good cause being shown, a jurisdictional authority may issue a written special permit authorizing an applicant to operate upon or remove from a highway maintained by that jurisdictional authority a vehicle or combination of vehicles that are any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Of a size, weight, or load exceeding the maximum specified in this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Otherwise not in conformity with this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The application for a special permit shall be on a form prescribed by the jurisdictional authority and shall specifically describe the vehicle or vehicles and load to be operated or moved and the particular highways upon which the special permit to operate is requested.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A jurisdictional authority may issue a special permit and charge a fee that does not exceed the administrative costs incurred authorizing the operation of the following upon a highway:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Traction engines or tractors having movable tracks with transverse corrugations upon the periphery of those movable tracks on farm tractors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Other farm machinery otherwise prohibited under this chapter.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A special permit shall specify the trip or trips and date or dates for which it is valid and the jurisdictional authority granting the special permit may restrict or prescribe conditions of operation of a vehicle or vehicles, if necessary, to protect the safety of the public or to ensure against undue damage to the road foundations, surfaces, structures, or installations, and may require a reasonable inspection fee and other security as that jurisdictional authority determines necessary to compensate for damages caused by the movement. A special permit may be issued on an annual basis. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the fee charged by the state transportation department for an intrastate or an out-of-state vehicle for a single trip shall be $50.00 and for multiple trips or on an annual basis shall be $100.00. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the fee charged by the state transportation department for an intrastate or an out-of-state vehicle for a permit issued under subsection (11) shall be $264.00. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the fee charged by a jurisdictional authority other than the state transportation department for an intrastate or an out-of-state vehicle for a single trip shall be not more than $50.00 and for multiple trips or on an annual basis shall be not more than $100.00. Effective October 1, 1998, the fee charged by a jurisdictional authority other than the state transportation department for a special permit under this subsection shall be the fee charged on September 30, 1997. The fee charged by a jurisdictional authority other than the state transportation department for a special permit under this subsection may be increased above the amount charged on September 30, 1997 subject to the maximums allowed by this subsection subject to a prior public hearing with reasonable notice. However, the fee charged by a jurisdictional authority other than the state transportation department for a special permit under this subsection that is more than $50.00 for a single trip or that is more than $100.00 for multiple trips or on an annual basis, or both, on September 30, 1997 shall not be increased.</div>

A person shall not violate any of the terms or conditions of the special permit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A person who violates this section is responsible for a civil infraction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A jurisdictional authority issuing a special permit to move a mobile home under this section and a person who is issued a special permit to move a mobile home under this section are subject to section 719a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow a jurisdictional authority to impose fees upon or enact regulations regarding a vehicle or combination of vehicles engaged in silvicultural operations if the vehicle or combination of vehicles is not in excess of the size, weight, or load maximums specified in this chapter and is otherwise in conformity with this chapter. This subsection does not excuse a vehicle or combination of vehicles engaged in silvicultural operations from the seasonal weight reductions described in section 722.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Beginning no later than 2 years after the effective date of the 2018 amendatory act that added this subsection, the state transportation department shall allow an applicant to obtain an annual permit for the movement of construction equipment under this section to exceed the size, load, or size and load maximums specified in this chapter for a power unit without requiring a separate permit for each individual piece of equipment carried by that power unit.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) When a person is arrested without a warrant for a violation of this act punishable as a misdemeanor, or an ordinance substantially corresponding to a provision of this act and punishable as a misdemeanor, under conditions not referred to in section 617, 619, or 727, the arresting officer shall prepare, as soon as possible and as completely as possible, an original and 3 copies of a written citation to appear in court containing the name and address of the person, the violation charged, and the time and place when and where the person shall appear in court. The officer shall inform the offender of the violation and shall give the second copy of the citation to the alleged offender. If the arrested person demands, he or she shall be arraigned by a magistrate or probate court as provided in section 727 in lieu of being given the citation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The time specified in the citation to appear shall be within a reasonable time after the arrest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The place specified in the citation to appear shall be before a magistrate or probate court within the county in which the violation charged is alleged to have been committed and who has jurisdiction of the violation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Appearance may be made in person, by representation, or by mail. If appearance is made by representation or mail, the magistrate may accept the plea of guilty or not guilty for purposes of arraignment, with the same effect as though the person personally appeared before him or her. The magistrate, by giving 5 days' notice of the date of appearance, may require appearance in person at the time and place designated in the citation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a nonresident is arrested without warrant for a violation of this act that is punishable as a misdemeanor, or an ordinance substantially corresponding to a provision of this act and punishable as a misdemeanor, under conditions not referred to in section 727, the arresting officer, upon demand of the arrested person, immediately shall take the person for arraignment by a magistrate in the vicinity to answer to the complaint made against the person. If a magistrate is not available or an immediate trial cannot be had, the person arrested may recognize to the officer for his or her appearance by leaving with the officer a guaranteed appearance certificate or a sum of money not to exceed $100.00, in which case the following provisions apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The officer making the arrest shall give a receipt to the person arrested for the guaranteed appearance certificate or the money deposited together with a written citation as provided in subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the alleged offender fails to appear as required in the citation, the guaranteed appearance certificate or deposit shall be forfeited as in other cases of default in bail in addition to any other penalty provided in this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) At or before the completion of his or her tour of duty, a police officer taking a certificate or deposit of money shall deliver the certificate or deposit of money either to the magistrate named in the citation together with a report of the facts relating to the arrest, or to the police chief or person authorized by the police chief to receive certificates and deposits. The police chief or person authorized by the police chief shall deposit with the court the certificate or the money deposited and the citation in the same manner as prescribed for citations in section 728a. Failure to make a report and deliver the money deposited is embezzlement of public money.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Guaranteed appearance certificate" means a card or certificate containing a printed statement that a surety company authorized to do business in this state guarantees the appearance of the person whose signature appears on the card or certificate, and that the company, if the person fails to appear in court at the time of trial or sentencing or to pay any fines or costs imposed under this act, will pay any fine, costs, or bond forfeiture imposed on the person in a total amount not to exceed $200.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An officer making an arrest under this chapter for a misdemeanor without a warrant, except under section 727, is not entitled to any fees for making the arrest or the issuance of a citation under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An officer or magistrate who violates this section is guilty of misconduct in office and subject to removal from office.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A police officer may issue a citation to a person who is an operator of a motor vehicle involved in an accident if, based upon personal investigation, the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person has committed a misdemeanor under this act in connection with the accident. The officer shall prepare an original and 3 copies of the citation, setting forth the name and address of the person, the violation that may be charged against the person, and the time and place of the appearance of the person in court. The citation shall inform the person of the office, bureau, or department to which requests for a change or adjournment of the court date may be made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the citation is issued to a person who is operating a commercial motor vehicle, the citation shall contain the vehicle group designation and indorsement description of the vehicle operated by the person at the time of the alleged violation.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Beginning on the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection and ending December 31, 2018, an individual whose driving privileges were suspended under this section may reinstate his or her operator's license without payment of a fee to the secretary of state for the reinstatement.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If an individual was assessed a driver responsibility fee under section 732a(2)(b)(iii) or (iv), (c), or (d), the individual may engage in 10 hours of participation in a workforce training payment program created under section 732c as an alternative to paying that fee or any unpaid portion of that fee. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An individual may engage in workforce training under subsection (1) by obtaining a workforce training form from the secretary of state or the department of treasury. The department of treasury shall mail to each individual who is required to pay a driver responsibility fee under section 732a(2)(b)(iii) or (iv), (c), or (d) a 1-time-only written notice of the option of completing workforce training as an alternative to paying that driver responsibility fee. The notice shall include a statement that workforce training forms for that purpose can be obtained from the department of state or from the department of treasury. The notice shall be sent to the last known address of the individual as shown in the records of the department of treasury. The secretary of state shall make workforce training forms available to the public at all branch offices and on the department's website for purposes of this section and shall provide workforce training forms to the department of treasury for purposes of this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If an individual chooses to engage in workforce training under this section, the individual shall complete the workforce training form obtained under subsection (2) and return the form to the department of treasury in the manner prescribed by the department of treasury. Upon receiving a properly completed workforce training form under this subsection, the department of treasury shall inform the department of state that the individual intends to complete workforce training under this section as an alternative to paying a driver responsibility fee or any portion of a driver responsibility fee. If the secretary of state is notified by the department of treasury that the individual has elected to complete workforce training under this section as an alternative to paying the fee, that fee shall be held in abeyance for a period of 45 days. If the individual's license is suspended for failing to pay the driver responsibility fee or portion of the driver responsibility fee, the department of state shall, upon payment of the reinstatement fee, reinstate the individual's driver license.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An individual who engages in workforce training under this section shall be allowed only 1 opportunity to complete the workforce training alternative for each driver responsibility fee owed. However, the department of treasury may allow an individual to withdraw from that workforce training before the expiration of the 45-day period for completing that workforce training for good cause shown. If the individual is allowed to withdraw from workforce training for good cause shown, that opportunity for completing workforce training shall not be considered in the number of opportunities to perform workforce training under this subsection, but the individual is subject to the suspension of his or her driving privileges under section 732a(5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Upon completing workforce training under this section, the individual may request the person with whom he or she engaged in workforce training under this section to verify on the workforce training form in the manner designated by the secretary of state that he or she successfully completed that workforce training. Upon verification, the individual may return the workforce training form to the department of treasury for purposes of this section. Any person who falsely verifies workforce training under this subsection and any individual who falsely requests the verification of workforce training under this section or who returns a community service form to the department of treasury under this subsection knowing that his or her workforce training is falsely verified is responsible for a state civil infraction and may be fined not more than $200.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The department of treasury shall waive the driver responsibility fee or any portion of the driver responsibility fee otherwise required to be paid under section 732a(2)(b)(iii) or (iv), (c), or (d) upon receiving verification that the individual successfully completed the workforce training requirements of this section. The department of treasury shall notify the department of state when it has waived the fee under this section or, if the fee is not waived under this section, that the 45-day period has expired and the fee has not been waived. If the secretary of state is notified by the department of treasury that the fee has not been waived, the department of state shall enter that information into the records of the department and shall suspend the individual's driver license and proceed as provided by law for the individual's failure to pay the driver responsibility fee or to complete workforce training under this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A police officer who witnesses a person violating this act or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to this act, which violation is a civil infraction, may stop the person, detain the person temporarily for purposes of making a record of vehicle check, and prepare and subscribe, as soon as possible and as completely as possible, an original and 3 copies of a written citation, which shall be a notice to appear in court for 1 or more civil infractions. If a police officer of a village, city, township, or county, or a police officer who is an authorized agent of a county road commission, witnesses a person violating this act or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to this act within that village, city, township, or county and that violation is a civil infraction, that police officer may pursue, stop, and detain the person outside the village, city, township, or county where the violation occurred for the purpose of exercising the authority and performing the duties prescribed in this section and section 749, as applicable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Any police officer, having reason to believe that the load, weight, height, length, or width of a vehicle or load are in violation of section 717, 719, 719a, 722, 724, 725, or 726 which violation is a civil infraction, may require the driver of the vehicle to stop, and the officer may investigate, weigh, or measure the vehicle or load.

A police officer may issue a citation to a person who is a driver of a motor vehicle when, based upon personal investigation by the police officer of a complaint by someone who witnessed the person violating this act or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to this act, which violation is a civil infraction, the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person is responsible for a civil infraction and if the prosecuting attorney or attorney for the political subdivision approves in writing the issuance of the citation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The form of a citation issued under subsection (1), (2), or (3) shall be as prescribed in sections 727c and 743.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The officer shall inform the person of the alleged civil infraction or infractions and shall deliver the third copy of the citation to the alleged offender.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) In a civil infraction action involving the parking or standing of a motor vehicle, a copy of the citation is not required to be served personally upon the defendant but may be served upon the registered owner by attaching the copy to the vehicle. A city may authorize personnel other than a police officer to issue and serve a citation for a violation of its ordinance involving the parking or standing of a motor vehicle. A city may authorize a person other than personnel or a police officer to issue and serve a citation for parking violations described in section 675d if the city has complied with the requirements of section 675d.

A parking violation notice may be issued by a police officer, including a limited duty officer, or other personnel duly authorized by the city, village, township, college, or university to issue such a notice under its ordinance. The citation filed with the court pursuant to this subsection need not comply in all particulars with sections 727c and 743 but shall consist of a sworn complaint containing the allegations stated in the parking violation notice and shall fairly inform the defendant how to respond to the citation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A citation issued under subsection (6) or (7) for a parking or standing violation shall be processed in the same manner as a citation issued personally to a defendant under subsection (1) or (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) As used in subsection (7):</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Parking violation notice" means a notice, other than a citation, directing a person to appear at a parking violations bureau in the city, village, or township in which, or of the college or university for which, the notice is issued and to pay the fine and costs, if any, prescribed by ordinance for the parking or standing of a motor vehicle in violation of the ordinance.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A person to whom a citation is issued under section 742 shall appear by or at the time specified in the citation and may respond to the allegations in the citation as provided in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the person wishes to admit responsibility for the civil infraction, the person may do so by appearing in person, by representation, or by mail. If appearance is made by representation or mail, the court may accept the admission with the same effect as though the person personally appeared in court. Upon acceptance of the admission, the court may order any of the sanctions permitted under section 907.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the person wishes to admit responsibility for the civil infraction "with explanation", the person may do so in either of the following ways:</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   By contacting the court in person, by mail, by telephone, or by representation to obtain from the court a scheduled date and time to appear, at which time the person shall appear in person or by representation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a person admits responsibility for a civil infraction "with explanation" under subsection (3), the court shall accept the admission as though the person has admitted responsibility under subsection (2) and may consider the person's explanation by way of mitigating any sanction which the court may order under section 907.

If the weight is not correctly stated or is not satisfactory, the secretary of state shall determine the actual weight. Each application for registration of a vehicle under subdivisions (j) and (m) must have attached to the application a scale weight receipt of the vehicle fully equipped as of the time the application is made. The scale weight receipt is not necessary if there is presented with the application a registration receipt of the previous year that shows on its face the weight of the motor vehicle as registered with the secretary of state and that is accompanied by a statement of the applicant that there has not been a structural change in the motor vehicle that has increased the weight and that the previous registered weight is the true weight.</div>

An application for a renewal of a registration using the regular mail and postmarked before the expiration date of that registration must not be assessed a late fee. The late fee collected under this subsection must be deposited into the general fund. The secretary of state shall waive the late fee collected under this subsection if all of the following are satisfied:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The registrant presents proof of storage insurance for the vehicle for which the late fee is assessed that is valid for the period of time between the expiration date of the most recent registration and the date of application for the renewal.</div>

The secretary of state shall notify a person who has elected to use the installment option of this subsection informing the person of the amount due and of the penalties that shall be imposed if payment is not received within 180 days before the date of expiration. If a person is once late on paying the balance, a penalty of 25% of the outstanding balance shall be assessed and collected in addition to the fee. If a person is twice late in paying the balance within a 2-year period, then a penalty of 25% of the outstanding balance shall be assessed and collected in addition to the fee, and the person is ineligible to elect the apportionment payment plan for the next 2 registration years following the year of the delinquency.

If the secretary of state is satisfied that the applicant is the owner of the motor vehicle, or is otherwise entitled to register the motor vehicle in the applicant's name, the secretary of state shall issue to the applicant an appropriate certificate of title under section 217. Before the secretary of state issues the certificate of title, the applicant shall attach to the application a statement showing the amount of use tax due upon the motor vehicle described in the application on a form prescribed by the state treasurer, together with the amount of the use tax due upon the motor vehicle, under the use tax act, 1937 PA 94, MCL 205.91 to 205.111.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a civil fine is ordered under subsection (2) or (3), the judge or district court magistrate shall summarily tax and determine the costs of the action, which are not limited to the costs taxable in ordinary civil actions, and may include all expenses, direct and indirect, to which the plaintiff has been put in connection with the civil infraction, up to the entry of judgment. Costs must not be ordered in excess of $100.00. A civil fine ordered under subsection (2) or (3) must not be waived unless costs ordered under this subsection are waived.

A schedule need not include all violations that are designated by law or ordinance as civil infractions. A schedule may exclude cases on the basis of a defendant's prior record of civil infractions or traffic offenses, or a combination of civil infractions and traffic offenses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The state court administrator shall annually publish and distribute to each district and court a recommended range of civil fines and costs for first-time civil infractions.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If a person has received a civil infraction citation for defective safety equipment on a vehicle under section 683, the court shall waive a civil fine, costs, and assessments on receipt of certification by a law enforcement agency that repair of the defective equipment was made before the appearance date on the citation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A default in the payment of a civil fine or costs ordered under subsection (2), (3), or (4) or a justice system assessment ordered under subsection (12), or an installment of the fine, costs, or assessment, may be collected by a means authorized for the enforcement of a judgment under chapter 40 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.4001 to 600.4065, or under chapter 60 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.6001 to 600.6098.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The court may waive any civil fine, cost, or assessment against an individual who received a civil infraction citation for a violation of section 710d if the individual, before the appearance date on the citation, supplies the court with evidence of acquisition, purchase, or rental of a child seating system meeting the requirements of section 710d.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) In addition to any civil fines or costs ordered to be paid under this section, the judge or district court magistrate shall order the defendant to pay a justice system assessment of $40.00 for each civil infraction determination, except for a parking violation or a violation for which the total fine and costs imposed are $10.00 or less.

An assessment levied under this subsection is not a civil fine for purposes of section 909.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) If a person has received a citation for a violation of section 223, the court shall waive any civil fine, costs, and assessment, on receipt of certification by a law enforcement agency that the person, before the appearance date on the citation, produced a valid registration certificate that was valid on the date the violation of section 223 occurred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) If a person has received a citation for a violation of section 328(1) for failing to produce a certificate of insurance under section 328(2), the court may waive the fee described in section 328(3)(c) and shall waive any fine, costs, and any other fee or assessment otherwise authorized under this act on receipt of verification by the court that the person, before the appearance date on the citation, produced valid proof of insurance that was in effect at the time the violation of section 328(1) occurred. Insurance obtained subsequent to the time of the violation does not make the person eligible for a waiver under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) If a person is determined to be responsible or responsible "with explanation" for a civil infraction under this act or a local ordinance that substantially corresponds to a provision of this act and the civil infraction arises out of the ownership or operation of a commercial quadricycle, the person must be ordered to pay costs as provided in subsection (4) and a civil fine of not more than $500.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) As used in this section, "moving violation" means an act or omission prohibited under this act or a local ordinance that substantially corresponds to this act that involves the operation of a motor vehicle and for which a fine may be assessed.</div>

<P>Sec. 908.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a defendant defaults in the payment of a civil fine, costs, or both, or of any installment, as ordered pursuant to section 907(2), the court, upon the motion of the plaintiff or upon its own motion, may require the defendant to show cause why the default should not be treated as in civil contempt and may issue a summons or order to show cause or a bench warrant of arrest for the defendant's appearance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   When a corporation or an association is ordered to pay a civil fine or costs, the persons authorized to make disbursement shall pay the fine or costs, and their failure to do so shall be civil contempt unless they make the showing required in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Unless the defendant shows that the default was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the order of the court or to a failure on his or her part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for payment, the court shall find that the default constitutes a civil contempt and may order the defendant committed until the civil fine, costs, or both, or a specified part thereof, is paid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If it appears that the default in the payment of a civil fine or costs does not constitute civil contempt, the court may enter an order allowing the defendant additional time for payment, reducing the amount of payment or of each installment, or revoking the fine or costs or the unpaid portion thereof in whole or in part.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The term of imprisonment on civil contempt for nonpayment of a civil fine or costs shall be specified in the order of commitment, and shall not exceed 1 day for each $10.00 of the fine and costs. A person committed for nonpayment of a civil fine or costs shall be given credit toward payment for each day of imprisonment and each day of detention in default of recognizance before judgment at the rate of $10.00 per day.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A defendant committed to imprisonment for civil contempt for nonpayment of a civil fine or costs shall not be discharged from custody until 1 of the following occurs:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The defendant has been credited with the amount due pursuant to subsection (5).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The amount due has actually been collected through execution of process or otherwise.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The amount due has been satisfied pursuant to a combination of subdivisions (a) and (b).</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Michigan has long been the hub of mobility, and for over 100 years, the economic fortunes of its businesses, communities, and families have been closely tied to that sector of industry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Today, the mobility sector is undergoing a period of unprecedented change.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The secretary is deemed to be an agent of the owner or operator of every uninsured motor vehicle for service of process in an action in this state arising out of the use or operation in this state of the uninsured motor vehicle. Where an action is commenced, summons and complaint shall be served on the secretary by certified or registered mail or by leaving a copy thereof with or at the office of the secretary who shall forward a copy of the summons and complaint forthwith by certified mail to the defendant at his last address as recorded with the secretary.

In actions where summons and complaint have been served upon the secretary, the secretary shall have the right to intervene in the action as a party defendant. This act does not apply to an accident occurring after the effective date of this amendatory act for which benefits are payable in whole or in part under sections 3101 to 3179 of Act No. 218 of the Public Acts of 1956, as amended.

In addition, the person is barred from asserting a mechanic's, garageman's, or similar lien upon a motor vehicle, including the repossession of a motor vehicle. A customer is entitled to recover any amount paid to an unregistered facility for the repair of a motor vehicle belonging to that customer.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Before beginning repair work, a motor vehicle repair facility shall give to the customer a written estimate that itemizes as closely as possible the price for labor and parts necessary for the work. A facility shall not charge for work done or parts supplied in excess of the estimated price, or in excess of the limit stated by the customer in the waiver described in subsection (3), without the knowing written or oral consent of the customer, obtained at some time after the facility determines that the estimated price or stated limit is insufficient and before any work that is not estimated or is in excess of the limit is done or the parts that are not estimated or are in excess of the limit are supplied. If a waiver is not signed under subsection (3) and the estimated price is exceeded by not more than 10% or $50.00, whichever is lesser, the facility is not required to obtain the written or oral consent of the customer for the excess charge unless specifically requested by the customer. This section shall not be construed as requiring a motor vehicle repair facility, mechanic, or mechanic trainee to give a written estimated price if the facility, mechanic, or trainee agrees not to perform the requested repair. If the actual cost of a repair is less than the agreed on estimated cost, the customer shall pay only the actual cost.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a facility or mechanic informs the customer that the price for repair will exceed the written estimate or the stated limit in the waiver and the customer does not want the repair work performed, the customer is responsible for all reasonable costs to return the vehicle to the condition it was in at the time it entered the facility. The facility shall indicate those costs in written form, itemizing the costs as closely as possible with a copy given to the customer. The cost of a diagnosis made by the facility, whether or not the customer authorizes the facility to perform those repairs, shall be included in the written estimate before the diagnosis is undertaken.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a customer initiates a request for service or parts for the repair of a motor vehicle without receiving a written estimate and voluntarily agrees to pay all reasonable costs of repair up to an amount stated by the customer, a facility may obtain from the customer a waiver of his or her right to receive a prior estimate of repair costs. The waiver shall be in 14 point or larger bold capital type face and executed with 1 copy to the customer who is requesting the repairs. The waiver shall read as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>"I, __________, voluntarily authorize __________ to provide services or parts in the repair of the below described motor vehicle without receiving an estimate of repair costs. By signing this form, I understand that I will give up my right to:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>1. Receive a written estimate of the cost for repairs;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>2. Approve in advance any repairs or costs with a total cost under $ __________; and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>3. Refuse to pay for repairs with a total cost less than the amount stated above.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The facility may exceed the amount stated above only after I give my written or oral approval.</div>

A motor vehicle repair facility or anyone in its employ shall not make use of a waiver described in subsection (3) in an attempt to evade this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A motor vehicle repair facility shall at all times display, in a place and manner conspicuous to its customers, a current and valid certificate of repair facility registration issued by the administrator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A motor vehicle repair facility shall include its registration number, as assigned by the administrator, on each copy of any instrument, form, contract, or other document used by the applicant in dealing with the public in the repair of motor vehicles, including, but not limited to, all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Any document on which the facility routinely requires the customer's signature.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A motor vehicle repair facility shall return replaced parts to the customer at the time the repair work is completed. All of the following apply to the obligation to return replaced parts under this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A facility is not required to return any of the following replaced parts to the customer:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Parts that are exempted from the return requirement by the administrator because of size, weight, or similar factors. However, a facility shall not prevent a customer from removing any heavy or large part, by the customer's own means and at his or her expense.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Subject to subsection (3), parts that the motor vehicle repair facility or mechanic is required to return to the manufacturer or distributor under a warranty or exchange arrangement. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) For reasons of safety, a gasoline tank or any other container-type part that was filled with or was otherwise in appreciable contact with flammable fuels, unless that part is rendered nonflammable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If any returned part presents an actual danger of flammability or explosiveness, the facility shall clearly inform the customer of that danger.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) When the repair work is completed, if requested by the customer, the facility shall reasonably clean the replaced parts that are to be returned or inspected by the customer. The facility shall place portable parts in a suitable container. The facility shall store any parts that it identifies as not portable in a suitable place in the facility for the customer's inspection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) If a facility charges a fee to a customer in connection with the return of replaced parts, the facility must disclose that fee to the customer in writing before the customer engages the facility to replace the part.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A customer shall be informed of his right to receive or inspect replaced parts as provided in this section before the customer executes any document or engages the facility or mechanic for the work. Subject to subsection (5), the facility shall provide this information to the customer by providing the following notice to the customer, printed or displayed on the face of any contract, work order form, or other document that evidences the engagement of the facility or mechanic in at least 12-point boldfaced letters that are at least 4 points larger that the principal size of the letters in that document, or providing the notice in a separate written document in at least 12-point, boldfaced, capital letters, as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>YOU ARE ENTITLED BY LAW TO THE RETURN OF ALL PARTS REPLACED, EXCEPT THOSE WHICH ARE TOO HEAVY OR LARGE, AND THOSE REQUIRED TO BE SENT BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER OR DISTRIBUTOR BECAUSE OF WARRANTY WORK OR AN EXCHANGE AGREEMENT. YOU ARE ENTITLED TO INSPECT THE PARTS WHICH CANNOT BE RETURNED TO YOU. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B> (3) If a facility is obligated to return a replaced part to the manufacturer or a distributor under a warranty agreement, or, subject to subsection (4), under an exchange agreement, the facility is not required to return that part to the customer. However, the facility or mechanic shall offer the customer an opportunity to inspect the replaced part. If the customer accepts the offer to inspect the part, or otherwise requests to inspect the part, the facility or mechanic shall allow the customer to inspect the part when the repair work is completed. A facility is not required to show a replacement part to a customer if the replacement is made without charge to the customer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If replacement of a part is contingent on the facility keeping the part under an exchange agreement, the facility shall explain, in a manner understandable to the customer, the precise terms of the exchange agreement, including if applicable a disclosure of the price to the customer if he or she wishes to reclaim the part. If a customer raises a question or dispute with the facility within 2 business days after the delivery of the repaired vehicle to the customer and the dispute involves an exchange part for which the facility required the customer pay a deposit in the amount of the facility's obligation, the facility shall refund the deposit to the customer if he or she returns the part to the facility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A facility that displays the notice described in subsection (2) on a clearly legible sign with lettering at least 1 inch high, conspicuously displayed in the part of the facility where customers routinely contract for repairs, is not required to provide the notice to a customer in the form of a document described in subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) All of the following apply to the disposition of replaced parts that are not returned to the customer:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Unless subdivision (b) applies, the facility shall not dispose of the parts for at least 2 business days after the customer takes possession of the repaired vehicle, unless the customer has specifically authorized immediate disposition of the parts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If a customer questions or disputes repairs performed by a facility or the charges for those repairs within 2 days after the customer takes possession of the repaired vehicle, the facility shall not dispose of the replaced parts until the question or dispute is resolved. If the dispute involves the replaced part, the facility shall, in the presence of the customer, immediately affix to the part a permanent mark sufficient to identify the part.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If requested by a customer, a facility shall explain exactly why a replaced part is defective or nonfunctional, or otherwise why it was replaced.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The motor vehicle repair facility shall display a clearly legible sign in a conspicuous place at the entrance of the facility that indicates that customers may make inquiries concerning repair service or complaints to the administrator and states the address and telephone number of the department.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If a new motor vehicle has any defect or condition that impairs the use or value of the new motor vehicle to the consumer or which prevents the new motor vehicle from conforming to the manufacturer's express warranty, the manufacturer or a new motor vehicle dealer of that type of motor vehicle shall repair the defect or condition as required under section 3 if the consumer initially reported the defect or condition to the manufacturer or the new motor vehicle dealer within 1 of the following time periods, whichever is earlier:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   During the term the manufacturer's express warranty is in effect.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Not later than 1 year from the date of delivery of the new motor vehicle to the original consumer.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 3.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a defect or condition that was reported to the manufacturer or new motor vehicle dealer pursuant to section 2 continues to exist and the new motor vehicle has been subjected to a reasonable number of repairs as determined under subsection (5), the manufacturer shall within 30 days, do either of the following as applicable:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the new motor vehicle was purchased, either replace the new motor vehicle with a comparable replacement motor vehicle currently in production and acceptable to the consumer or accept return of the vehicle and refund to the consumer the purchase price. A consumer shall have the right to demand a refund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the new motor vehicle was leased, the consumer has the right to a refund of the lease price paid by the consumer. The consumer may agree to accept a comparable replacement vehicle in lieu of a refund for the lease price paid. If the consumer agrees to accept a replacement vehicle, the lease agreement shall not be altered except with respect to the identification of the vehicle.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The purchase price or lease price includes the cost of any options or other modifications installed or made by or for the manufacturer, and the amount of all other charges made by or for the manufacturer, less a reasonable allowance for the consumer's use of the vehicle, and less an amount equal to any appraised damage that is not attributable to normal use or to the defect or condition. A reasonable allowance for use is the purchase or lease price of the new motor vehicle multiplied by a fraction having as the denominator 100,000 miles and having as the numerator the miles directly attributable to use by the consumer and any previous consumer prior to his or her first report of a defect or condition that impairs the use or value of the new motor vehicle plus all mileage directly attributable to use by a consumer beyond 25,000 miles. If a vehicle is replaced or refunded under the provisions of this section, if towing services and rental vehicles were not made available without cost to the consumer, the manufacturer shall also reimburse the consumer for those towing costs and reasonable costs for a comparable rental vehicle that were incurred as a direct result of the defect or condition.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a court or an alternative dispute settlement procedure described in section 5 determines that a consumer has provided sufficient evidence that the vehicle did not provide reliable transportation for ordinary personal or household use for any period beyond the first 25,000 mileage usage period of the vehicle, the court or the alternative dispute settlement procedure may reduce the vehicle usage deduction for mileage beyond the first 25,000 mileage usage period only for the period beyond the 25,000 mileage usage period that the court or alternative dispute settlement procedure determines that the vehicle did not provide useful transportation for ordinary personal or household use. To determine if the vehicle did or did not provide useful transportation for ordinary personal and household use, the court or the alternative dispute settlement procedure shall consider all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The number of repairs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The cost of the repairs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The number of days the vehicle was out of service.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Whether the vehicle's need for repair significantly affected the consumer's ability to use the vehicle for personal or household functions.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The provisions of this act do not affect the obligations of a consumer under a loan, sales, or lease contract or the secured interest of a secured party. The secured party shall consent to the replacement of the security interest with a corresponding security interest on a replacement motor vehicle that is accepted by the consumer in exchange for the motor vehicle having a defect or condition pursuant to subsection (1), if the replacement motor vehicle is comparable in value to the original motor vehicle. If for any reason the security interest in the new motor vehicle having a defect or condition pursuant to subsection (1) is not able to be replaced with a corresponding security interest on a new motor vehicle accepted by the consumer, the consumer shall accept a refund. A refund required under this subsection or subsection (1) shall be made to the consumer and the secured party, if any, as their interests exist at the time the refund is to be made. The lessor, if any, shall be notified if a refund is made to a lessee under this act. A lessor shall not assess a fee for early termination of a lease under this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   It shall be presumed that a reasonable number of attempts have been undertaken to repair a defect or condition if 1 of the following occurs:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The same defect or condition that substantially impairs the use or value of the new motor vehicle to the consumer has been subject to repair a total of 4 or more times by the manufacturer or new motor vehicle dealer within 2 years of the date of the first attempt to repair the defect or condition, and the defect or condition continues to exist. Any repair performed on the same defect made pursuant to subsection (6) shall be included in calculating the number of repairs under this section. The consumer or his or her representative, before availing himself or herself of a remedy provided under subsection (1), and any time after the third attempt to repair the same defect or condition, shall give written notification, by return receipt service, to the manufacturer of the need for repair of the defect or condition in order to allow the manufacturer an opportunity to cure the defect or condition. The manufacturer shall notify the consumer as soon as reasonably possible of a reasonably accessible repair facility. After delivery of the vehicle to the designated repair facility, the manufacturer has 5 business days to repair the defect or condition.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The new motor vehicle is out of service because of repairs for a total of 30 or more days or parts of days during the term of the manufacturer's express warranty, or within 1 year from the date of delivery to the original consumer, whichever is earlier. The consumer, or his or her representative, before availing himself or herself of a remedy provided under subsection (1), and after the vehicle has been out of service for at least 25 days in a repair facility, shall give written notification by return receipt service to the manufacturer of the need for repair of the defect or condition in order to allow the manufacturer an opportunity to cure the defect or condition. The manufacturer shall notify the consumer as soon as reasonably possible of a reasonably accessible repair facility. After delivery of the vehicle to the designated repair facility, the manufacturer has 5 business days to repair the defect or condition.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Any repairs required to be made under this act shall be made even if the repairs need to be performed after the expiration of the manufacturer's express warranty. The defect needing repair must be a continuation of the original attempt to repair the defect.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The term of an express warranty, and the 1-year, 30-day, and 5-day periods of time provided for in this section shall be extended because repair services were not available to the consumer because of war, invasion, strike, fire, flood, or other natural disaster.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The department of state police shall inspect each school bus annually, and as the department of state police determines necessary where school bus defects have been found, to determine if the school bus meets the requirements of this act and the rules promulgated pursuant to this act. The department of state police may delegate the inspection of school buses to publicly employed inspectors if the inspection complies with this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Inspection of a school bus may be accomplished at any time, at any location, on or off a school site, and as frequently as the department of state police considers necessary to secure passenger safety. A school bus may be rejected by the inspecting state police official for further use in transportation of passengers if it does not meet the requirements of this act and the rules promulgated pursuant to this act. However, if a school bus is determined to be safe for operation even though in unsatisfactory condition, the official may determine that not more than 60 days shall be allowed to effect a specific repair.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A person, school, or school bus owner shall not operate or permit to be operated a school bus which has not been inspected under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Any public or private entity that owns or uses a school bus for pupil transportation shall identify itself to the department of state police so an inspection can be scheduled. If an entity has had school buses inspected in the previous year, it is considered to have identified itself. If an entity stops pupil transportation in 1 year and restarts pupil transportation in a later year, it must identify itself to the department of state police as requiring inspection before restarting pupil transportation. An entity is considered to have identified itself by notifying a person of the department of state police responsible for conducting inspections under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) When an inspection is scheduled by the department of state police, an entity shall identify to the state police inspector all of the school buses that it intends to use for pupil transportation in that school year. Any school bus that is not submitted for inspection shall be rejected and have a red sticker affixed pursuant to section 41.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The department of state police may prohibit the placement and use of any device or equipment on a school bus that presents a safety hazard to the pupils, driver, or motorists during the loading, unloading, or transportation of pupils.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A school, before establishing a contract with a company for school bus services, shall require the company to verify in writing that the buses used by the contractor have been inspected by the department of state police and have passed that inspection. The school shall specify in a written contract that the contractor will not use any school buses that have not been inspected or have failed inspection, and that a violation of this provision of the contract will result in revocation of the contract. The contract shall specify that the contractor shall submit, in writing, the inspection results of its entire fleet of buses to the school within 30 days of the completion of the department of state police inspection. A school shall identify to the department of state police all of the contractors the school is using upon request.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A vehicle that is determined by a state police official to be unsafe for further operation as a school bus shall not be used. An unsafe vehicle shall have affixed to its windshield, by the state police official, a red sticker which shall read as follows: "This vehicle may not be driven. Utilization of this vehicle is in violation of law. {reverse side} Do not remove without State Police authorization." The sticker shall remain until the condition is corrected. A school bus may be transported to a maintenance facility for repair if the school bus driver provides written proof of destination to a state police official upon request.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A school bus that is considered to be in unsatisfactory condition, but that is safe for operation, shall have affixed to its windshield by the state police official a yellow sticker which shall read as follows: "This vehicle has equipment defects. {reverse side} Repairs and reinspection shall be obtained on or before _____. Do not remove without State Police authorization." If, upon reinspection, the vehicle defect has not been repaired, replaced, or corrected, the state police official shall remove the yellow sticker and affix a red sticker to the vehicle. Exceptions may be made when the necessary parts or equipment has been ordered but not received at the time of reinspection. Reinspection may take place within 60 days after the original inspection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A school bus that is considered to be in satisfactory condition after inspection by a state police official shall have a Michigan vehicle inspection passing sticker affixed to its windshield. The owner of a school bus shall remove or destroy the pass sticker before selling the school bus. The display of a pass sticker on a vehicle other than a school bus is a state civil infraction.

When the distance from the stopped bus to the end of the highway or roadway is less than 200 feet, clear and continuous visibility must be available from the bus to the end of the highway or roadway.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Within 50 feet of an intersection if the intersection is controlled by a traffic control signal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A school may provide instruction on proper school bus etiquette which may include, but not be limited to, boarding and leaving the bus, evacuation of the bus in an emergency, and road crossing procedures and the correct hand signal in the district, if any.
