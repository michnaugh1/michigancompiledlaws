<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) In weighing the varied interests of the residents of this state, the department shall consider the individual interest of any person, public or private corporation, local or regional transportation authority, local governmental unit, private carrier, group of rail users, state agency, other public or private entity, including a port authority established under the Hertel-Law-T. Stopczynski port authority act, 1978 PA 639, MCL 120.101 to 120.130, or any combination of these entities, expressing a desire to acquire or lease or secure an easement for the use of a portion or all of the real property owned by a railroad company. The property acquired by the department under this act may be conveyed or leased to an entity or combination of entities listed in this subsection with appropriate reimbursement, as determined by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Upon acquisition of a right-of-way, the department may preserve the right-of-way for future use as a railroad line and, if preserving it for that use, shall not permit any action that would render it unsuitable for future rail use. If the department determines a right-of-way or other property acquired under this act is no longer necessary for railroad transportation purposes, the department may preserve and utilize the right-of-way for other transportation purposes or may dispose of the right-of-way or other property acquired under this act for the purposes described in section 6, or may dispose of or lease the right-of-way or other property for other purposes, as appropriate. The department shall not dispose of or lease a right-of-way without first offering to transfer the right-of-way to the department of natural resources. If the department of natural resources desires to lease or purchase the right-of-way, the department of natural resources must indicate its desire to lease or purchase the right-of-way within 60 days and accept the offered transfer within 1 year after the offer is made. If the department of natural resources does not indicate a desire to lease or purchase the right-of-way within 60 days, the department may dispose of or lease the right-of-way as otherwise provided for in this act. If the department of natural resources does not accept the offered transfer within 1 year after indicating its desire to lease or purchase the right-of-way, the department may dispose of or lease the right-of-way as otherwise provided for in this act. When appropriate, a right-of-way or other property shall be transferred or leased to a public or private entity with appropriate reimbursement, as determined by the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In preserving a right-of-way for future rail use, the department may do 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Develop the right-of-way for use as a commuter trail where the use is feasible and needed or lease the right-of-way to a county, city, village, or township expressing a desire to develop the right-of-way as a commuter trail. The lease shall be for an indefinite period of time and is cancelable by the department only if the right-of-way is needed for rail usage. The trails, unless leased to a county, city, village, or township, shall remain under the jurisdiction of the department.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Transfer, for appropriate reimbursement, the right-of-way to the department of natural resources for use as a Michigan trailway pursuant to part 721 of the natural resources and environmental protection act, 1994 PA 451, MCL 324.72101 to 324.72116, if the deed includes restrictions on the use of the property that assure that the property remains viable for future rail usage, and includes a clause that requires the department of natural resources to transfer, for appropriate reimbursement, the right-of-way to the department, upon a determination of the director of the department that the right-of-way is needed for use as a railroad line.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Lease the right-of-way to the department of natural resources, or upon approval of the department of natural resources, to a county, city, village, or township for use as a recreational trail. The lease shall be for an indefinite period of time and is cancelable by the department only if the right-of-way is needed for rail usage. A recreational trail shall be reserved for non-motorized forms of recreation or snowmobiling only. Snowmobiling shall not be allowed on more than 50% of the mileage of the recreational trails established pursuant to this act. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) In cases where a trail serves both a significant commuter and recreation function, authorize the joint development of the trail by the department and the department of natural resources, or the department and any interested county, city, village, or township. Administration of the trail shall be determined jointly by the department and the department of natural resources.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) As a term of conveyance, the department may require restrictions on the use of the property that assure that the property remains viable for future rail use and that the rail line is made available by the purchaser for future freight or passenger rail uses and that the property will revert to the department if the purchaser fails to maintain the property so that it remains viable for future rail use.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) To maintain authorized status for a bus, a motor carrier shall ensure that the bus passes a valid inspection as provided in this section and that the condition of the bus is maintained between inspections.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Beginning on January 1, 2017, for an inspection of a bus to be a valid inspection, all of the following shall be satisfied:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An inspection has been scheduled at the department's convenience.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The inspector of the bus indicates on an inspection report prepared by the department that the bus has passed the inspection before the expiration of the previous inspection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the inspection is of a seasonal bus, the inspection occurred no earlier than 30 days before the beginning of the approved seasonal period for that bus.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The department shall accept an inspection conducted by the department of state police if that inspection meets the requirements of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A bus that does not have a valid inspection under this section shall not be operated over the public highways of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A motor carrier is subject to all of the following penalties for each bus that does not have a valid inspection as required by this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A motor carrier shall be assessed a fee of $250.00 for each inspection that is conducted between 1 and 30 days late, and a fee of $500.00 for each inspection that is conducted 31 or more days late. This fee shall be in addition to any fee assessed under subdivision (b). The department may waive the fee provided for in this subdivision if the late inspection was primarily caused by the schedule of the safety inspector. A vehicle that fails an inspection is subject to the late inspection fees described in this subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The motor carrier shall be assessed a $100.00 reinspection fee for each inspection after an initial failed inspection until the vehicle passes or is permanently removed from service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A motor carrier that is assessed a reinspection fee under subdivision (b) shall pay the reinspection fee before the department conducts the reinspection on the vehicle for which the reinspection fee was assessed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Instead of an inspection by the department under subsection (2), a motor carrier may, no later than the end of the month in which the inspection expires, provide evidence of a current year inspection by a state, district, province, or local municipality that has standards comparable to the federal motor carrier safety periodic inspection standards and that has been approved by the department. The department may issue a list of the states, districts, provinces, and local municipalities that have standards comparable to the federal standards promulgated under 49 CFR part 396.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A motor carrier shall maintain a copy of a current valid inspection report on board each bus at all times, and the report shall be made available for review upon demand by an authorized federal, state, or local official.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the department has reasonable cause to believe that a bus is unsafe for operation or has not been inspected as required by this act or rules promulgated under this act, a department safety inspector may inspect the bus. If the bus is not in compliance with this act, the department may require the motor carrier to place the bus out of service until all violations have been corrected or eliminated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Upon satisfactory completion of a valid inspection of a bus as required by this act and payment of all required fees by the motor carrier, the department shall issue a decal indicating the expiration date of the inspection for that bus. A decal issued under this subsection is property of this state. A motor carrier shall not use a bus displaying an expired decal to provide for-hire passenger service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) A motor carrier shall not operate a bus over the public highways of this state if that bus does not have a properly displayed current decal issued by the department under subsection (8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The department may require a motor carrier to return a decal issued under subsection (8) to the department if the bus upon which that decal was displayed is removed from the motor carrier's roster by the department or the motor carrier. A motor carrier that fails to return a decal within 30 days after a request by the department shall pay a $50.00 fee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The department may waive the inspection and renewal requirements of this act for a bus that is not being used in this state for a motor carrier that is located outside of this state if the motor carrier submits a roster that indicates which of its vehicles will be used exclusively outside of this state for at least 1 year. The roster must be submitted before the affected vehicle ceases to comply with this act. The motor carrier may put the bus back into service in this state after at least 1 year by submitting a revised roster and complying with all other provisions of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Until the department conducts an inspection as provided in this act, or January 1, 2018, whichever is later, an inspection that was conducted and passed in accordance with this act or the limousine transportation act, 1990 PA 271, MCL 257.1901 to 257.1939, before January 1, 2017 shall be considered a valid inspection.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A police officer or a peace officer may seize and impound a vehicle that is operated by a motor carrier in violation of this act or a rule promulgated by this act or is in such a condition that the continued operation of the vehicle upon the highway would constitute an immediate hazard to the public. Upon impoundment, the vehicle is subject to a lien, subordinate to a prior lien of record, in the amount of any fine, costs, and damages that the defendant may be ordered to pay under this act. Upon impoundment, a notice shall be sent to the owner and any lienholder of record as kept by the secretary of state of the vehicle that the vehicle is available for pickup by the owner or lienholder of record as kept by the secretary of state. The notice shall be accompanied by an invoice for any outstanding charges imposed under this act. The notice shall inform the owner and any lienholder of record as kept by the secretary of state that the owner and lienholder of record as kept by the secretary of state have 30 days from the date of the notice and upon payment of applicable charges to pick up the impounded vehicle. A notice under this subsection shall be sent by the agency authorizing the impoundment of the vehicle to the applicable address on record with the secretary of state by certified mail or by another commercially available delivery service providing proof of delivery. The defendant or a person with an ownership interest in the vehicle may post with the court a cash or surety bond in the amount of $750.00. If a bond is posted, the vehicle shall be released from impoundment. The vehicle shall also be released, and the lien shall be discharged, upon a judicial determination that the defendant is not responsible for a violation of this act or upon payment of the fine, costs, and damages. Additionally, if the defendant is determined to be not responsible for the violation of this act, the court shall assess against the governmental entity bringing the action costs, payable to the defendant, for any damages that the defendant has sustained due to the impoundment of the vehicle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the court determines that the defendant is responsible for the violation of this act and the defendant defaults in the payment of any fine, costs, or damages, or any installment, as ordered under this section, a bond posted under subsection (1) shall be forfeited and applied to the fine, costs, damages, or installment. The court shall certify any remaining unpaid amount to the attorney for the governmental entity bringing the action. If the owner or lienholder of record as kept by the secretary of state does not pick up the vehicle within the 30-day period described in subsection (1), the vehicle may be sold by foreclosure sale. The foreclosure sale shall be conducted in the manner provided and subject to the same rights as apply in the case of execution sales under sections 6031, 6032, 6041, 6042, and 6044 to 6047 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.6031, 600.6032, 600.6041, 600.6042, and 600.6044 to 600.6047.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Not less than 21 days before a foreclosure sale under subsection (2), the attorney for the governmental entity bringing the action shall by certified mail send written notice of the time and place of the foreclosure sale to the owner and any lienholder of record as kept by the secretary of state. In addition, not less than 10 days before the foreclosure sale, the attorney shall twice publish notice of the time and place of the foreclosure sale in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the vehicle was seized. The attorney for the governmental entity bringing the action shall provide the buyer and the secretary of state with a copy of the proof of notice under this subsection to the owner and lienholder of record as kept by the secretary of state, and a bill of sale. The secretary of state shall use the documentation provided to issue the appropriate certificate of title. The proceeds of the foreclosure sale shall be distributed in the following order of priority: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) To discharge any lien on the vehicle that was recorded prior to the creation of the lien under subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) To the clerk of the court for the payment of the fine, costs, and damages, that the defendant was ordered to pay.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) To discharge any lien on the vehicle that was recorded after the creation of the lien under subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) To the owner of the vehicle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The department may use any and all available legal and equitable remedies of a civil nature to enforce this act, an order issued, or a rule promulgated pursuant to this act. The department may employ experts, assistants, inspectors, and other personnel as necessary subject to civil service rules, to enable it to administer and enforce this act. An employee of the department shall not ask for or receive any fee from a person for the taking of acknowledgments or any other service. State and local police officers shall enforce this act and the rules promulgated pursuant to this act. A police officer or a peace officer may arrest, on sight or upon warrant, any person found violating or having violated a provision of this act or a rule promulgated pursuant to this act. The attorney general of this state and the prosecuting attorneys of the counties of this state shall prosecute all violations of this act.
