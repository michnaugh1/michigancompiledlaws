        Am. 1996, Act 374, Eff. Oct. 1, 1996 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> The Supreme Court in Judicial Attorneys Association v State of Michigan, 460 Mich 590; 597 NW2d 113 (1999), ruled that 1996 PA 374 did not violate Const 1963, art 9 § 29 (Headlee amendment) because Act 374 of 1996 neither imposed new activities nor increased the level of activities on local units.1996 PA 374 merged the Recorder's Court into the Third Circuit Court. In adopting a narrow interpretation of Const 1963, art 9, § 29, the Court held that the second sentence of § 29 is only triggered by a mandate that requires local units to perform an activity that the state previously did not require local units to perform or at an increased level from that previously required of local units and that the act did not trigger § 29 and did not violate the Headlee amendment.</p>

A judge of 1 county shall not be assigned to serve as a judge in another county unless no other trial court judge in the county needing assistance is able to render that assistance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Judges assigned pursuant to subsection (1) shall hold court and fulfill the duties of the office just as they would had they been elected in the respective court for the time they were assigned to serve.</DIV>

Mar. 22, 2002 <BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> Section 2 of Act 182 of 1981 provides: “(1) The fifty-fifth judicial circuit is not created and the circuit judgeship proposed for that circuit is not authorized unless all of the following occur:“(a) The counties of Clare and Gladwin, by resolutions adopted by each of their county boards of commissioners, approve the creation of the fifty-fifth judicial circuit and the judgeship proposed for that circuit.“(b) The clerk of each county in subdivision (a) files a copy of the county's respective resolution with the secretary of state not later than December 22, 1981.“(c) The county of Isabella approves the reformation of the twenty-first judicial circuit as provided in subsection (2).“(2) The twenty-first judicial circuit is not reformed unless all of the following occur:“(a) The county of Isabella, by resolution adopted by its county board of commissioners, approves the reformation of the twenty-first judicial circuit.“(b) The clerk of the county of Isabella files a copy of the resolution with the secretary of state not later than December 22, 1981.“(c) The counties of Clare and Gladwin approve the creation of the fifty-fifth judicial circuit as provided in subsection (1).“(3) If the reformation of the twenty-first judicial circuit and the creation of the fifty-fifth judicial circuit are approved pursuant to subsections (1) and (2), the secretary of state shall immediately notify the state court administrator.“(4) By proposing the creation of the fifty-fifth judicial circuit and a circuit judgeship for that circuit and the reformation of the twenty-first judicial circuit, the legislature is not creating the fifty-fifth judicial circuit or any judgeship in that circuit, or reforming the twenty-first judicial circuit. If the counties of Clare and Gladwin, acting through their respective boards of commissioners, approve the creation of the circuit and the circuit judgeship proposed by law for that circuit, or if the county of Isabella approves the reformation of the twenty-first judicial circuit each approval constitutes an exercise of the affected county's option to provide a new activity or service or to increase the level of activity or service offered in the county beyond that required by existing law, as the elements of that option are defined by Act No. 101 of the Public Acts of 1979, being sections 21.231 to 21.244 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, and a voluntary acceptance by the county of all expenses and capital improvements which may result from the creation of the circuit and judgeship, or from the reformation of the circuit. However, the exercise of the option does not affect the state's obligation to pay to each county a portion of the circuit judge's or judges' salary as provided by law, or to appropriate and disburse funds to each county for the necessary costs of state requirements established by a state law which becomes effective on or after December 23, 1978.“(5) If the county of Isabella approves the reformation of the twenty-first judicial circuit and the counties of Clare and Gladwin approve the creation of the fifty-fifth judicial circuit, then the incumbent circuit judge in the twenty-first judicial circuit who is a qualified elector in Clare or Gladwin county and who has been appointed to that office by the governor after January 1, 1981, becomes the circuit judge in the fifty-fifth judicial circuit on January 1, 1982, and serves as a circuit judge until January 1 next succeeding the first general election held after the vacancy to which he or she was appointed occurs, at which election a successor shall be elected for the remainder of the unexpired term which the predecessor incumbent serving on December 30, 1980, would have served had that incumbent remained in office in the twenty-first judicial circuit until his or her term would normally have expired.”</p>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An additional circuit judgeship permitted by this chapter shall not be authorized to be filled by election unless each county in the circuit, by resolution adopted by the county board of commissioners, approves the creation of that judgeship and unless the clerk of each county adopting such a resolution files a copy of the resolution with the state court administrator not later than 4 p.m. of the sixteenth Tuesday preceding the August primary for the election to fill the additional circuit judgeship. The state court administrator shall immediately notify the elections division of the department of state with respect to each new circuit judgeship authorized pursuant to this subsection.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A resolution required under subsection (1) that is filed before the effective date of the amendatory act that authorized that judgeship is a valid approval of the judgeship for purposes of this section only if the filing occurs within the 2-year state legislative session during which the amendatory act was enacted. A resolution required under subsection (1) that is filed after the effective date of the amendatory act that added that judgeship is a valid approval of the judgeship for purposes of this section only if the filing occurs not later than 4 p.m. of the sixteenth Tuesday preceding the August primary for the election immediately preceding the effective date of the additional judgeship.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) By permitting an additional judgeship, or by restoring a judgeship after a temporary reduction in judgeships as described in subsection (5), the legislature is not creating that judgeship. If a county, acting through its board of commissioners, approves the creation of an additional circuit judgeship, that approval constitutes an exercise of the county's option to provide a new activity or service or to increase the level of activity or service offered in the county beyond that required by existing law, as the elements of that option are defined by 1979 PA 101, MCL 21.231 to 21.244, and a voluntary acceptance by the county of all expenses and capital improvements which may result from the creation of the judgeship. However, the exercise of the option does not affect the state's obligation to pay the same portion of the additional judge's salary which is paid by the state to the other judges of the same circuit, or to appropriate and disburse funds to the county for the necessary costs of state requirements established by a state law which becomes effective on or after December 23, 1978.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Each additional circuit judgeship created pursuant to subsection (1) shall be filled by election pursuant to the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.1 to 168.992. The first term of each additional circuit judgeship shall be 6 years, unless the law permitting the additional judgeship provides for a term of a different length.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If, by law, the number of judgeships in a judicial circuit is temporarily reduced for a period of not more than 6 years and then restored to the number of judgeships that existed before the temporary reduction, the restored judgeship or judgeships are not considered additional circuit judgeships for purposes of this section, and a resolution of approval under subsection (1) is not required.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A temporary reduction in the number of circuit judgeships in a judicial circuit shall not take effect unless both of the following occur:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Each county in the circuit, by resolution adopted by the county board of commissioners, supports the temporary reduction in the number of judgeships.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The clerk of each county adopting the resolution files a copy of the resolution with the state court administrator not later than 4 p.m. of the sixteenth Tuesday preceding the date on which the August primary would have been held for the judgeship that is being eliminated. A resolution required under subdivision (a) that is filed before the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection is valid if the filing occurs within the 2-year state legislative session during which the amendatory act was enacted.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a new judicial circuit is proposed by law, that new circuit is not created and any circuit judgeship proposed for the circuit is not authorized or filled by election unless each county in the proposed circuit, by resolution adopted by the county board of commissioners, approves the creation of the new circuit and each judgeship proposed for the circuit and unless the clerk of each county adopting that resolution files a copy of the resolution with the state court administrator not later than 4 p.m. of the sixteenth Tuesday preceding the August primary immediately following the effective date of the amendatory act permitting the creation of the new circuit. The state court administrator shall immediately notify the elections division of the department of state with respect to each new judicial circuit and circuit judgeship authorized under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) By proposing a new judicial circuit and 1 or more circuit judgeships for the circuit, the legislature is not creating that circuit or any judgeship in the circuit. If a county, acting through its board of commissioners, approves the creation of a new circuit and 1 or more circuit judgeships proposed by law for that circuit, that approval constitutes an exercise of the county's option to provide a new activity or service or to increase the level of activity or service offered in the county beyond that required by existing law, as the elements of that option are defined by 1979 PA 101, MCL 21.231 to 21.244, and a voluntary acceptance by the county of all expenses and capital improvements that may result from the creation of the new circuit and each judgeship. However, the exercise of the option does not affect the state's obligation to pay a portion of the circuit judge's or judges' salary as provided by law, or to appropriate and disburse funds to the county for the necessary costs of state requirements established by a state law that takes effect on or after December 23, 1978.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Each circuit judgeship created under subsection (1) must be filled by election under the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.1 to 168.992. The first term of each circuit judgeship is 6 years, unless the law permitting the creation of the new circuit and 1 or more judgeships provides for a term of a different length.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The stipulation shall be filed with the chief judge of the court in which the action is pending together with a copy of a receipt from the clerk of the court indicating that the fees and costs were deposited with the clerk of the court for deposit in the funds established in each judicial circuit pursuant to sections 557a and 557b.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   Except for good cause shown to the chief judge of the court in which the action is pending, a final judgment shall be entered by the senior judge within 21 days after all parties have submitted their closing proofs and arguments. An order, decision, or judgment of the senior judge is conclusive, and appeal shall not be available to any party. The order, decision, or judgment is enforceable to the same extent as an order, decision, or judgment of the court in which the action was pending.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The parties to the stipulation may select 2 other senior judges from the list approved by the supreme court and resubmit the stipulation for approval and assignment of a senior judge to hear the action without the payment of an additional stipulation assignment fee under section 557a.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 557b.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   There is established in the circuit court in each judicial circuit a senior judge civil action fund. The senior judge civil action fund shall be used to pay the compensation and costs of actions under this section. The following money shall be deposited in the senior judge civil action fund:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A sum of money equal to the estimated compensation that will be due the senior judge for his or her services, costs, and actual and necessary expenses as provided in section 557(3)(b), (c), (d), and (f).</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Such other funds as provided by law or by court rule.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Before receiving payment from the fund, a senior judge shall file a detailed statement of services rendered and costs incurred. The chief judge of the court in which the action is pending shall review and approve the statement.

The chief judge may adjourn the trial until the additional amount is deposited. If the designated additional amount is not paid within 10 days after entry of an order for the additional amount, the chief judge may take such appropriate actions as considered necessary, including returning the action to the status it had before the filing of the stipulation, for failure to comply with the order for the additional amount.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Money deposited in the senior judge civil action fund in excess of the actual compensation and costs of the trial shall be refunded to the parties within a reasonable time after final judgment.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 591.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The county board of commissioners in each county shall annually appropriate, by line-item or lump-sum budget, funds for the operation of the circuit court in that county. However, before a county board of commissioners may appropriate a lump-sum budget, the chief judge of the judicial circuit shall submit to the county board of commissioners a budget request in line-item form with appropriate detail. A court that receives a line-item budget shall not exceed a line-item appropriation or transfer funds between line items without the prior approval of the county board of commissioners. A court that receives a lump-sum budget shall not exceed that budget without the prior approval of the county board of commissioners.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In a single-county circuit, the county is the employer of the county-paid employees of the circuit court in that county. In a multicounty circuit, the employer of the county-paid employees of the circuit court shall be as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   As determined pursuant to a contract entered into by the counties within the circuit under Act No. 8 of the Public Acts of the Extra Session of 1967, being sections 124.531 to 124.536 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the counties within the circuit do not enter into an agreement described in subdivision (a), each county is the employer of the county-paid employees who serve in that county or who are designated by agreement of the counties within the circuit as being employed by that county.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The employer of county-paid employees of the circuit court designated under subsection (2), in concurrence with the chief judge of the circuit court, has the following authority:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   To establish personnel policies and procedures, including, but not limited to, policies and procedures relating to compensation, fringe benefits, pensions, holidays, leave, work schedules, discipline, grievances, personnel records, probation, and hiring and termination practices.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   To make and enter into collective bargaining agreements with representatives of the county-paid employees of the circuit court in that county or in the counties covered by a contract entered into under subsection (2)(a).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the employer of the county-paid employees of the circuit court and the chief judge of the circuit court are not able to concur on the exercise of their authority as to any matter described in subsection (3)(a), that authority shall be exercised by either the employer or the chief judge as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The employer has the authority to establish policies and procedures relating to compensation, fringe benefits, pensions, holidays, and leave.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The chief judge has authority to establish policies and procedures relating to work schedules, discipline, grievances, personnel records, probation, hiring and termination practices, and other personnel matters not included in subdivision (a).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The employer of the county-paid employees of the circuit court designated under subsection (2) and the chief judge of the circuit court each may appoint an agent for collective bargaining conducted under subsections (3) and (4).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The chief judge of the circuit court in the county may elect not to participate in the collective bargaining process for county-paid employees of the circuit court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Except as otherwise provided by law, the chief judge of the circuit court in each judicial circuit shall appoint, supervise, discipline, or dismiss the employees of the circuit court in that judicial circuit in accordance with personnel policies and procedures developed pursuant to subsection (3) or (4) and any applicable collective bargaining agreement. Compensation of the employees of the circuit court in each judicial circuit shall be paid by the county or counties comprising the judicial circuit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If the implementation of the 1996 amendatory act that amended this section requires a transfer of court employees or a change of employers, all employees of the former court employer shall be transferred to, and appointed as employees of, the appropriate employer designated under subsection (2) subject to all rights and benefits they held with the former court employer. An employee who is transferred shall not, by reason of the transfer, be placed in any worse position with respect to worker's compensation, pension, seniority, wages, sick leave, vacation, health and welfare insurance, or any other terms and conditions of employment that the employee enjoyed as an employee of the former court employer. The rights and benefits protected by this subsection may be altered by a future collective bargaining agreement or, for employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements, by benefit plans as established and adopted by the employer designated under subsection (2). An employee who is transferred shall not be made subject to any residency requirements by the employer designated under subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   The employer designated under subsection (2) shall assume and be bound by any existing collective bargaining agreement held by the former court employer and, except where the existing collective bargaining agreement may otherwise permit, shall retain the employees covered by that collective bargaining agreement. A transfer of court employees shall not adversely affect any existing rights and obligations contained in the existing collective bargaining agreement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   When performing services in a courtroom, employees of the circuit court are subject to the control of the judge holding court in the courtroom.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   Subsections (2) to (9) shall not apply to the employees serving in the circuit court in the third judicial circuit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   The role of the chief judge under this section is that of the principal administrator of the officers and personnel of the court and is not that of a representative of a source of funding. The state is not a party to the contract. Except as otherwise provided by law, the state is not the employer of court officers or personnel and is not liable for claims arising out of the employment relationship of court officers or personnel or arising out of the conduct of court officers or personnel.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)   As used in this section, "county-paid employees of the circuit court" means persons employed in the circuit court in a county who receive any compensation as a direct result of an annual budget appropriation approved by the county board of commissioners of that county, but does not include a judge of the circuit court.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   Annual leave which an employee of the circuit court in the third judicial circuit or the recorder's court of the city of Detroit has accumulated before October 1, 1996, shall be transferred with the employee as a result of the employee becoming an employee of the employer designated under subsection (2) or (3).

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The additional judges of probate permitted by section 803 shall not be filled by election unless the county, by resolution adopted by the county board of commissioners, approves the creation of that judgeship and unless the clerk of that county files a copy of the resolution with the state court administrator not later than 4 p.m. of the thirteenth Tuesday preceding the August primary for the election to fill the additional judge of probate. The state court administrator shall immediately notify the county clerk with respect to any new judge of probate authorized for that county under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) By permitting an additional judgeship, the legislature is not creating that judgeship. If a county, acting through its board of commissioners, approves the creation of an additional judge of probate, that approval constitutes an exercise of the county's option to provide a new activity or service or to increase the level of activity or service offered in the county beyond that required by existing law, as the elements of that option are defined by 1979 PA 101, MCL 21.231 to 21.244, and a voluntary acceptance by the county of all expenses and capital improvements that may result from the creation of the judgeship. However, the exercise of the option does not affect the state's obligation to pay the same portion of the additional judge's salary that is paid by the state to the other judges of probate of the same county, or to appropriate and disburse funds to the county for the necessary costs of state requirements established by a state law that takes effect on or after December 23, 1978.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Each additional judgeship created under subsection (1) shall be filled by election under the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.1 to 168.992. The first term of each additional judgeship shall be 6 years unless the law permitting the additional judgeship provides for a term of a different length.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A combination of the office of probate judge with a judicial office of limited jurisdiction within a county under section 15 of article VI of the state constitution of 1963 that does not result in an increase in the total number of trial judgeships in the county does not require a resolution of approval by the county board of commissioners under this section.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 837.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The county board of commissioners in each county shall annually appropriate, by line-item or lump-sum budget, funds for the operation of the probate court in that county. However, before a county board of commissioners may appropriate a lump-sum budget, the chief judge of the probate court in that county or that probate district shall submit to the county board of commissioners a budget request in line-item form with appropriate detail. A court that receives a line-item budget shall not exceed a line-item appropriation or transfer funds between line items without the prior approval of the county board of commissioners. A court that receives a lump-sum budget shall not exceed that budget without the prior approval of the county board of commissioners.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In a county that is not part of a probate district, the county is the employer of the county-paid employees of the probate court in that county. In a probate district, the employer of the county-paid employees of the probate court shall be as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   As determined pursuant to a contract entered into by the counties within the probate district under Act No. 8 of the Public Acts of the Extra Session of 1967, being sections 124.531 to 124.536 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the counties within the probate district do not enter into an agreement described in subdivision (a), each county is the employer of the county-paid employees of the probate court who serve in that county or who are designated by agreement of the counties within the probate district as being employed by that county.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The employer of county-paid employees of the probate court designated under subsection (2), in concurrence with the chief judge of the probate court, has the following authority:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   To establish personnel policies and procedures, including, but not limited to, policies and procedures relating to compensation, fringe benefits, pensions, holidays, leave, work schedules, discipline, grievances, personnel records, probation, and hiring and termination practices.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   To make and enter into collective bargaining agreements with representatives of the county-paid employees of the probate court in that county or in the counties covered by a contract entered into under subsection (2)(a).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the employer of the county-paid employees of the probate court and the chief judge of the probate court are not able to concur on the exercise of their authority as to any matter described in subsection (3)(a), that authority shall be exercised by either the employer or the chief judge as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The employer has the authority to establish policies and procedures relating to compensation, fringe benefits, pensions, holidays, and leave.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The chief judge has authority to establish policies and procedures relating to work schedules, discipline, grievances, personnel records, probation, hiring and termination practices, and other personnel matters not included in subdivision (a).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The employer of the county-paid employees of the probate court designated under subsection (2) and the chief judge of the probate court each may appoint an agent for collective bargaining conducted under subsections (3) and (4).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The chief judge of the probate court in the county may elect not to participate in the collective bargaining process for county-paid employees of the probate court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Except as otherwise provided by law, the chief judge of the probate court in a county or probate court district shall appoint, supervise, discipline, or dismiss the employees of the probate court in that county or probate court district in accordance with personnel policies and procedures developed pursuant to subsection (3) or (4) and any applicable collective bargaining agreement. Compensation of the employees of the probate court shall be paid by the county or, in the case of a probate district, by the counties comprising the probate court district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If the implementation of the 1996 amendatory act that amended this section requires a transfer of court employees or a change of employers, all employees of the former court employer shall be transferred to, and appointed as employees of, the appropriate employer designated under subsection (2) subject to all rights and benefits they held with the former court employer. An employee who is transferred shall not, by reason of the transfer, be placed in any worse position with respect to worker's compensation, pension, seniority, wages, sick leave, vacation, health and welfare insurance, or any other terms and conditions of employment that the employee enjoyed as an employee of the former court employer. The rights and benefits protected by this subsection may be altered by a future collective bargaining agreement or, for employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements, by benefit plans as established and adopted by the employer designated under subsection (2). An employee who is transferred shall not be made subject to any residency requirements by the employer designated under subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   The employer designated under subsection (2) shall assume and be bound by any existing collective bargaining agreement held by the former court employer and, except where the existing collective bargaining agreement may otherwise permit, shall retain the employees covered by that collective bargaining agreement. A transfer of court employees shall not adversely affect any existing rights and obligations contained in the existing collective bargaining agreement.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   When performing services in a courtroom, employees of the probate court are subject to the control of the judge holding court in the courtroom.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   The role of the chief judge under this section is that of the principal administrator of the officers and personnel of the court and is not that of a representative of a source of funding. The state is not a party to the contract. Except as otherwise provided by law, the state is not the employer of court officers or personnel and is not liable for claims arising out of the employment relationship of court officers or personnel or arising out of the conduct of court officers or personnel.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   As used in this section, "county-paid employees of the probate court" means persons employed in the probate court in a county who receive any compensation as a direct result of an annual budget appropriation approved by the county board of commissioners of that county, but does not include a judge of the probate court.</DIV>

Oct. 1, 1996 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> The Michigan Supreme Court held in Judicial Attorneys Association v Michigan, 459 Mich 291; 597 NW2d 113 (1999), that MCL 600.593a (3)-(10) and parallel provisions of MCL 600.591, 600.837, 600.8271, 600.8273, and 600.8274 violate the separation of powers clause of Const 1963, art 3, § 2 and are unconstitutional.1996 PA 374 provided that a local council created pursuant to the act or Wayne County became the employer of the employees of the Third Circuit and Recorder's Courts. The Court ruled that because subsections (3)-(10) of MCL 600.593a are not a sufficiently limited exercise by one branch of another branch's power that they impermissibly interfere with the judiciary's inherent authority to manage its internal operations and, therefore, are unconstitutional because they violate the separation of powers clause of Const 1963, art 3, § 2.</p>

<P>Sec. 1064.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Each drug treatment court shall determine whether an individual may be admitted to the drug treatment court.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   To be admitted to a drug treatment court, an individual must cooperate with and complete a preadmissions screening and evaluation assessment and must agree to cooperate with any future evaluation assessment as directed by the drug treatment court. A preadmission screening and evaluation assessment shall include all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A complete review of the individual's criminal history, and a review of whether or not the individual has been admitted to and has participated in or is currently participating in a drug treatment court, whether admitted under this act or under section 11 of chapter II of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 762.11, section 7411 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7411, section 4a of chapter IX of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 769.4a, section 1 of chapter XI of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 771.1, section 350a of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.350a, or section 430 of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.430, and the results of the individual's participation. A review of the law enforcement information network may be considered sufficient for purposes of this subdivision unless a further review is warranted. The court may accept other verifiable and reliable information from the prosecution or defense to complete its review and may require the individual to submit a statement as to whether or not he or she has previously been admitted to a drug treatment court and the results of his or her participation in the prior program or programs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   An assessment of the risk of danger or harm to the individual, others, or the community.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   As much as practicable, a complete review of the individual's history regarding the use or abuse of any controlled substance or alcohol and an assessment of whether the individual abuses controlled substances or alcohol or is drug or alcohol dependent. It is the intent of the legislature that this assessment should be a clinical assessment as much as practicable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A review of any special needs or circumstances of the individual that may potentially affect the individual's ability to receive substance abuse treatment and follow the court's orders.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   For a juvenile, an assessment of the family situation including, as much as practicable, a comparable review of any guardians or parents.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Except as otherwise permitted in this act, any statement or other information obtained as a result of participating in a preadmission screening and evaluation assessment under subsection (3) is confidential and is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246, and shall not be used in a criminal prosecution, unless it reveals criminal acts other than, or inconsistent with, personal drug use.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The court may request that the department of state police provide to the court information contained in the law enforcement information network pertaining to an individual applicant's criminal history for the purposes of determining an individual's admission into the drug treatment court and general criminal history review, including whether the individual has previously been admitted to and participated in a drug treatment court under this act, or under section 11 of chapter II of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 762.11, section 7411 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.7411, section 4a of chapter IX of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 769.4a, section 1 of chapter XI of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 771.1, section 350a of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.350a, or section 430 of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.430, and the results of the individual's participation.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For an individual who pled guilty to, or admitted responsibility for, criminal charges for which he or she was admitted into the drug treatment court, the court shall do either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) In the case of an individual who pled guilty to an offense that is not a traffic offense and who may be eligible for discharge and dismissal pursuant to the agreement with the court and prosecutor upon successful completion of the drug treatment court program, the court shall not enter a judgment of guilt or, in the case of a juvenile, shall not enter an adjudication of responsibility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) In the case of an individual who pled guilty to a traffic offense or who pled guilty to an offense but may not be eligible for discharge and dismissal pursuant to the agreement with the court and prosecutor upon successful completion of the drug treatment court program, the court shall enter a judgment of guilt or, in the case of a juvenile, shall enter an adjudication of responsibility.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Unless a memorandum of understanding made pursuant to section 1088 between a receiving drug treatment court and the court of original jurisdiction provides otherwise, the original court of jurisdiction maintains jurisdiction over the drug treatment court participant as provided in this act until final disposition of the case, but not longer than the probation period fixed under section 2 of chapter XI of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 771.2. In the case of a juvenile participant, the court may obtain jurisdiction over any parents or guardians of the juvenile in order to assist in ensuring the juvenile's continued participation and successful completion of the drug treatment court, and may issue and enforce any appropriate and necessary order regarding the parent or guardian of a juvenile participant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The drug treatment court shall cooperate with, and act in a collaborative manner with, the prosecutor, defense counsel, treatment providers, the local substance abuse coordinating agency for that circuit or district, probation departments, and, to the extent possible, local law enforcement, the department of corrections, and community corrections agencies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The drug treatment court may require an individual admitted into the court to pay a reasonable drug court fee that is reasonably related to the cost to the court for administering the drug treatment court program as provided in the memorandum of understanding under section 1062.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A review of the individual's history regarding the use or abuse of any controlled substance or alcohol and an assessment of whether the individual abuses controlled substances or alcohol or is drug or alcohol dependent. It is the intent of the legislature that, to the extent practicable, an assessment under this subdivision shall be a clinical assessment completed by the VA.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A review of the individual's mental health history. It is the intent of the legislature that, to the extent practicable, this assessment shall be a clinical assessment completed by the VA.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A review of any special needs or circumstances of the individual that may potentially affect the individual's ability to receive substance abuse treatment and follow the court's orders.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Divide the number equal to the total number of names which appear on the list received pursuant to section 1310 by the result, obtaining the nearest integral quotient. Example: If there are 50,000 names on the combined list, divide 50,000 by 150.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The result is the key number for the period for which jurors are to be selected. Example: 50,000 divided by 150 equals 333-1/3, so 333 would be the key number in the example.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(16)   As used in this section:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Fee-generating case" means a case or matter that, if undertaken on behalf of an indigent by an attorney in private practice, reasonably would be expected to result in payment of a fee for legal services from an award to a client, from public funds, or from the opposing party.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   The service provider that represents an indigent in the case has determined that free referral is not possible for any of the following reasons:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)   The case has been rejected by the local lawyer referral service or, if there is no such service, by 2 attorneys in private practice who have experience in the subject matter of the case.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(B)   Neither the local lawyer referral service, if one exists, nor an attorney in private practice will consider the case without payment of a consultation fee.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(C)   The case is of a type that an attorney in private practice in the area ordinarily does not accept or does not accept without initial payment of a fee.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2146.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A writing or record, whether in the form of an entry in a book or otherwise, made as a memorandum of an act, transaction, occurrence, or event is admissible in evidence in a proceeding in a court or before an officer, arbitrator, or referee in proof of the act, transaction, occurrence, or event if it was made in the regular course of business and it was the regular course of business to make such a memorandum at the time of, or within a reasonable time after, the act, transaction, occurrence, or event. Other circumstances of the making of the writing or record, including lack of personal knowledge by the entrant or maker, may be shown to affect its weight but not its admissibility. The term "business" includes a business, profession, occupation, or calling of any kind. The lack of an entry regarding an act, transaction, occurrence, or event in a writing or record so proved may be received as evidence that the act, transaction, occurrence, or event did not, in fact, take place. A reproduction of such a writing or record is admissible in evidence in a trial, hearing, or proceeding by order of the court, made within its discretion, upon motion with notice of not less than 4 days. All circumstances of the making of the reproduction may be shown upon the trial, hearing, or proceeding to affect the weight but not the admissibility of the evidence.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2147.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Notwithstanding any law of this state to the contrary, an individual, firm, association, or corporation may introduce in evidence at a trial or hearing before a court, officer, arbiter, referee, board, or tribunal, a reproduction of a business record of the individual or institution prepared or entered in the regular course of business, the original of which would be admissible in evidence, including an existing record and including, but not by way of limitation, a check, bill, note, acceptance, or other type of commercial instrument, passbook, deposit slip, or statement furnished to depositors, whether or not the individual or institution regularly so reproduces any or all of such business records. The reproduction shall be in a medium pursuant to the records media act or consist of a printout or other output readable by sight from such a medium. The reproduction, if accompanied by the certificate of the individual or his or her employee or agent, or of the officer, agent, or employee of the firm, association, or corporation who supervised the making of the reproduction to the effect that the reproduction when made was a true, full, and complete reproduction of the original, shall be received as evidence at the trial or hearing with the same force and effect as though the original document were produced. However, the court, officer, arbiter, referee, board, or tribunal may in its discretion require that the original document be produced in evidence, and may also require the taking of testimony of the person who supervised the making of the reproduction. The reproduction is admissible only if the party offering it delivers a copy of it, or of so much of it as may relate to the controversy, to the adverse party a reasonable time before trial, unless in the opinion of the trial court, officer, arbiter, referee, board, or tribunal the adverse party has not been unfairly surprised by the failure to deliver the copy. Nevertheless, such a reproduction need not be submitted to the adverse party as herein prescribed unless the original instrument would be required to be so submitted. If necessary, the reproduction may be offered in evidence by the use of a projector or other similar device. All circumstances surrounding the making of the reproduction may be shown upon the trial, hearing, or proceeding for the purpose of affecting the weight but not the admissibility of the evidence.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2421c.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The court that conducts a civil action brought by or against the state as a party, except for a civil infraction action, shall award to a prevailing party other than the state the costs and fees incurred by that party in connection with the civil action, if the court finds that the position of the state to the civil action was frivolous. To find that the state's position was frivolous, the court shall determine that at least 1 of the following conditions has been met:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The state's primary purpose in initiating the action was to harass, embarrass, or injure the prevailing party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The state had no reasonable basis to believe that the facts underlying its legal position were in fact true.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The state's legal position was devoid of arguable legal merit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the parties to an action do not agree on the awarding of costs and fees under sections 2421a to 2421f, a motion may be brought regarding the awarding of costs and fees and the amount thereof. The party seeking an award of costs and fees under sections 2421a to 2421f shall establish all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   That the position of the state was frivolous.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   That the party was the prevailing party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The amount of costs and fees sought including an itemized statement from any attorney, agent, or expert witness who represented the party showing the rate at which the costs and fees were computed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   That the party is eligible to receive an award of costs and fees under sections 2421a to 2421f. For good cause shown a party may seek a protective order regarding the financial records of that party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The court may reduce the amount of the costs and fees to be awarded, or deny an award, to the extent that the party seeking the award engaged in conduct which unduly and unreasonably protracted the civil action.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Subject to subsection (5), the amount of costs and fees awarded under this section shall include those reasonable costs actually incurred by the party and any costs allowed by law or by court rule. Subject to subsection (5), the amount of fees awarded under this section shall be based upon the prevailing market rate for the kind and quality of the services furnished, except that an attorney fee shall not be awarded at a rate of more than $75.00 per hour unless the court determines that special circumstances existed justifying a higher rate or an applicable law or court rule provides for the payment of a higher rate.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The costs and fees awarded under this section shall only be awarded to the extent and amount that the state caused the prevailing party to incur those costs and fees.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   This section does not apply to an agency or department in establishing a rate; in approving, disapproving, or withdrawing approval of a form; nor in its role of hearing or adjudicating a case. Unless an agency had discretion to proceed, this section does not apply to an agency or department acting ex rel on the information and at the instigation of a nonagency or nondepartmental person who has a private interest in the matter nor to an agency or department required by law to commence a case upon the action or request of another nonagency or nondepartmental person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   This section does not apply to an agency or department that has such a minor role as a party in the case in comparison to other nonprevailing parties so as to make its liability for costs and fees under this section unreasonable, unjust, or unfair.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) For services under the direction of the court that are not specifically provided for in this section related to receiving, safekeeping, or expending money, purchasing, taking, or transferring a security, or collecting interest on a security, a party shall pay the allowance and compensation that the court determines to be just as ordered by the court after notice to the parties. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Upon appeal to the court of appeals or the supreme court, the appellant shall pay $25.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The applicant or requesting party shall pay $15.00 as a service fee for each writ of garnishment, attachment, or execution and each judgment debtor discovery subpoena issued.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The fees paid as provided in this section are payment in full for all clerk, entry, and judgment fees in an action from the commencement of the action to and including the issuance and return of the execution or other final process, and are taxable as costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the fees paid under this section must be paid to the county treasurer as required by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) At the end of each month, each fee collected under subsection (1)(d)(i) must be paid to the county treasurer and deposited by the county treasurer as provided under section 2530 to be used to fund services that are not title IV-D services. The fee collected under subsection (1)(d)(ii) must be paid to the county treasurer and deposited by the county treasurer as provided under section 2530.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The court shall order any of the fees prescribed in this section waived or suspended, in whole or in part, upon a showing by affidavit of indigency or inability to pay.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the person filing an action described in subsection (1)(d) is a public officer acting in his or her official capacity, if the final judgment or order is submitted with the initial filing as a consent judgment or order, or if other good cause is shown, the court shall order the fee under subsection (1)(d) waived or suspended. If a fee is waived or suspended and the action is contested, the court may require that 1 or more of the parties to the action pay the fee under subsection (1)(d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The court may order a party to pay the other party all or part of a fee paid by the other party under subsection (1)(d).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A party is not required to pay a fee under this section if the party is filing a child protective action or a delinquency action under section 2 of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.2, or under the young adult voluntary foster care act, 2011 PA 225, MCL 400.641 to 400.671.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Whenever a bond is required by law to be given by any person in order to entitle him to any right or privilege conferred by law or to commence any proceeding, it is not necessary that the bond conform in all respects to the form prescribed by the statute. It is sufficient if it substantially conforms to the form prescribed by the statute and does not vary so as to prejudice the rights of the party to whom or for whose benefit the bond is given.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Whenever a bond defective in any respect has been or is given, the court, officer, or body that would be authorized to receive the bond or to entertain any proceeding in consequence of the bond if it were perfect may amend the bond in any respect upon the application of the obligors of the bond or may allow a new bond bearing the date at which the earlier bond was required to be given to be substituted in the place of the defective bond upon the application of the person required to give the bond. The new bond shall then be deemed valid from the date of the execution of the earlier bond. When application is made to amend, the court, officer, or body is not limited to the particular amendment applied for but has power to amend the bond in any respect so as to make the defective bond meet the requirements that existed at the time it was given. When a new bond is allowed, it shall be substantially the same as might have been demanded when the defective bond was given.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   To render the filing of a complaint constructive notice to a purchaser of any real estate, the plaintiff shall file for record, with the register of deeds of the county in which the lands to be affected by such constructive notice are situated, a notice of the pendency of such action, setting forth the title of the cause, and the general object thereof, together with a description of the lands to be affected thereby.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Such a notice may be filed with the complaint before the service of the summons; but, in that case, personal or substituted service of the summons must be made upon a defendant, within 60 days after the filing, or else, before the expiration of the same time, publication must be commenced, or service thereof must be made without the state, as prescribed by law. If the defendant dies within 60 days after the filing of the notice and before commencement or completion of service of the summons, the summons may be served upon the person substituted for the defendant within 60 days after such substitution.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The register of deeds shall record such notice, in a book kept for that purpose, upon the payment of the fee as is provided by law.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In any pending or future action, other than an action to foreclose a mortgage or for the partition of real property or for dower, in which a notice of the pendency thereof has been filed and in which it appears to the court that adequate relief can be secured to the party who filed the same by the giving of a bond, where the cancellation of such notice is not otherwise expressly provided for or regulated, any person having an interest in the property affected by the action may apply for the cancellation thereof upon notice to all the parties to the action and to such other persons as the court may direct.</DIV>

The recovery may be obtained by a separate civil action, or by motion in the action as to which the notice was filed.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2911.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Words imputing a lack of chastity to any female or male are actionable in themselves and subject the person who uttered or published them to a civil action for the slander in the same manner as the uttering or publishing of words imputing the commission of a criminal offense.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)(a)   Except as provided in subdivision (b), in actions based on libel or slander the plaintiff is entitled to recover only for the actual damages which he or she has suffered in respect to his or her property, business, trade, profession, occupation, or feelings.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Exemplary and punitive damages shall not be recovered in actions for libel unless the plaintiff, before instituting his or her action, gives notice to the defendant to publish a retraction and allows a reasonable time to do so, and proof of the publication or correction shall be admissible in evidence under a denial on the question of the good faith of the defendant, and in mitigation and reduction of exemplary or punitive damages. For libel based on a radio or television broadcast, the retraction shall be made in the same manner and at the same time of the day as the original libel; for libel based on a publication, the retraction shall be published in the same size type, in the same editions and as far as practicable, in substantially the same position as the original libel; and for other libel, the retraction shall be published or communicated in substantially the same manner as the original libel.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the defendant in any action for slander or libel gives notice in a justification that the words spoken or published were true, this notice shall not be of itself proof of the malice charged in the complaint though not sustained by the evidence. In an action for slander or for publishing or broadcasting a libel even though the defendant has pleaded or attempted to prove a justification he or she may prove mitigating circumstances including the sources of his or her information and the ground for his or her belief. Damages shall not be awarded in a libel action for the publication or broadcast of a fair and true report of matters of public record, a public and official proceeding, or of a governmental notice, announcement, written or recorded report or record generally available to the public, or act or action of a public body, or for a heading of the report which is a fair and true headnote of the report. This privilege shall not apply to a libel which is contained in a matter added by a person concerned in the publication or contained in the report of anything said or done at the time and place of the public and official proceeding or governmental notice, announcement, written or recorded report or record generally available to the public, or act or action of a public body, which was not a part of the public and official proceeding or governmental notice, announcement, written or recorded report or record generally available to the public, or act or action of a public body.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A person against whom a judgment is recovered for damages arising out of the authorship or publication of a libel is entitled to recover contribution in a civil action from all persons who were originally jointly liable for the libel with the defendant or defendants, whether joined as defendants or not, to the same extent as and with the same effect that joint sureties are liable to contribute to each other in cases where they are sureties on the same contract. If the libel has been published in a newspaper, magazine, or other periodical publication or by a radio or television broadcast, the servants and agents of the publisher or proprietor of the periodical or radio or television station or network, and the news agents and other persons who have been connected with the libel only by selling or distributing the publication containing the libel and who have not acted maliciously in selling or publishing the libel, shall not be required to contribute and shall not be taken into account in determining the amount that any joint tort feasor is required to contribute under the provisions of this section. If the author of the libel acted maliciously in composing or securing the printing or the publication of the libel and the printer, publisher, or distributor of the libel acted in good faith and without malice in printing and publishing the libel, the author of the libel is liable in a civil action to that printer, publisher, or distributor for the entire amount of the damages which are recovered against and paid by that printer, publisher, or distributor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   In actions brought for the recovery of damages for libel in this state, it is competent for the defendant or defendants in the action to show in evidence upon the trial of the action that the plaintiff in the action has previously recovered a judgment for damages in an action for libel to the same or substantially the same purport or effect as the libel for the recovery of damages for which the action has been brought, or that the plaintiff in the action has previously brought an action for the libel or has received or agreed to receive compensation for the libel.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   An action for libel or slander shall not be brought based upon a communication involving public officials or public figures unless the claim is sustained by clear and convincing proof that the defamatory falsehood was published with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether or not it was false.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   An action for libel or slander shall not be brought based upon a communication involving a private individual unless the defamatory falsehood concerns the private individual and was published negligently. Recovery under this provision shall be limited to economic damages including attorney fees.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   As used in this section, "libel" includes defamation by a radio or television broadcast.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   After a bankrupt has been discharged from his debts pursuant to the federal laws relating to bankruptcy, the bankrupt, his receiver, his trustee, or any other interested person or corporation may apply to have a judgment debt canceled and discharged of record upon proof of the bankrupt's discharge. Application for equitable relief shall be made to the court in which the judgment was rendered against the bankrupt, or if it was rendered in a court not of record, application shall be made to the court in which it became a judgment by docketing. If it appears upon the hearing that he has been discharged from the payment of that judgment or the debt upon which that judgment was recovered, an order shall be made directing that the judgment be canceled and discharged of record. This order shall recite that the judgment is canceled and discharged because of the bankrupt's discharge in bankruptcy. The clerk of the court shall then discharge the judgment by marking on the docket that the judgment is canceled and discharged by order of the court because of the defendant's discharge in bankruptcy, and the clerk shall mark the date and entry of the order of discharge.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Notice of the application, accompanied by copies of the papers on which it is based, must be served on the judgment creditor or his attorney of record in the judgment, if the residence or place of business of either the creditor or his attorney of record is known, at least 30 days prior to the date of the hearing of the application. Upon proof by affidavit that the residences and places of business of both are unknown and after due diligence cannot be ascertained or upon proof by affidavit that the creditor is not a resident of this state and his attorney is dead or removed from this state or cannot be found within this state, the judge of the court before which the application is pending may make an order that the notice of the application be published once a week for 3 successive weeks in the newspaper that he shall designate. This publication shown by affidavit of the publisher shall be sufficient service of the application upon the judgment creditor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   No action or proceeding shall be prosecuted in any of the courts of this state to enforce any judgment rendered in any court of any other state of the United States which would be subject to cancellation and discharge under the provisions of this section had the judgment been rendered by a court of this state.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Any person who:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   cuts down or carries off any wood, underwood, trees, or timber or despoils or injures any trees on another's lands, or</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   digs up or carries away stone, ore, gravel, clay, sand, turf, or mould or any root, fruit, or plant from another's lands, or</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   cuts down or carries away any grass, hay, or any kind of grain from another's lands without the permission of the owner of the lands, or on the lands or commons of any city, township, village, or other public corporation without license to do so, is liable to the owner of the land or the public corporation for 3 times the amount of actual damages. If upon the trial of an action under this provision or any other action for trespass on lands it appears that the trespass was casual and involuntary, or that the defendant had probable cause to believe that the land on which the trespass was committed was his own, or that the wood, trees, or timber taken were taken for the purpose of making or repairing any public road or bridge judgment shall be given for the amount of single damages only.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)(a)   Any guardian, tenant in dower, life tenant, or tenant for years who commits or suffers any waste, during his term or estate, to the lands, tenements or hereditaments, without having a lawful license to do so, is liable for double the amount of actual damages. Any joint tenant or tenant in common who commits or suffers waste of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments held in joint tenancy, without having a lawful license in writing to do so, is liable for double the amount of actual damages at the suit of his cotenant.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A claim under this provision may be brought by the person having the next immediate estate, in fee, for life, or for years or by any person who has the remainder or reversion in fee or for life after an intervening estate for life or for years; and each of the parties shall recover damages according to his estate in the premises. A joint tenant or tenant in common may bring the claim in case of waste by one of his joint tenants or tenants in common. An heir, whether of full age or not, after coming into possession of his inheritance, may maintain a claim for waste done in the time of his ancestor as well as in his own time, unless recovery has been had by the executor or administrator of the ancestor. A tenant who assigns his full interest is not liable for waste done or suffered by his assignees while he remains out of possession of the premises.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)(a)   The circuit court shall grant injunctions to stay and prevent threatened trespass when the remedies provided by subsection (1), above, are not fully adequate and in any case where the trespass is of a continuing nature.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   In any case where there is not a plain, adequate, and complete remedy provided for waste by subsection (2), above, or where waste is threatened the circuit court may grant injunctions to stay and prevent waste.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Having taken jurisdiction of the case the circuit court may at the same time dispose of all questions involved, including the assessing and awarding of money damages.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   After the commencement of any action based on a claim for damages for waste, or for the recovery of land, or for the possession of land the defendant shall not make any waste of the land in demand or premises in question during the pendency of the action. If the defendant commits, threatens to commit, or makes preparations to commit waste the court in which the action is pending or any circuit judge or circuit court commissioner may make, on the application of the plaintiff, an order restraining the defendant from the commission of any waste or further waste of the land in demand or premises in question. Any person violating the terms of any such order is guilty of a contempt of the court in which the action is pending, which is punishable as other cases of contempt.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If any person commits, threatens to commit, or makes preparations to commit any waste on real estate which has been attached or levied upon by execution in any civil action, the court from which the execution or attachment issued or any circuit judge or circuit court commissioner may make, on the application of the plaintiff, an order restraining the person from committing any waste or further waste on the land which has been attached or levied upon. Any person who shall violate the terms of any such order is guilty of contempt of the court in which the action is pending and is punishable as in other cases of contempt.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)(a)   If, at any time after the sale of real estate on execution and before a deed is executed in pursuance of the sale, the defendant in the execution or any other person commits waste on the real estate or removes from it any buildings, fences, or other fixtures belonging to the land which would pass to the grantee by a deed of conveyance of the land, the purchaser at the sale or any person who has acquired his rights may have and maintain, against the person doing the injury and against any other person who has the buildings, fences, or fixtures in his possession after their removal, the same actions which the absolute owner of the premises would be entitled to.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Whenever any lands or tenements are sold by virtue of an execution issued upon any judgment, the person to whom the conveyance is executed by the sheriff pursuant to the sale has a claim for damages for any waste committed on the premises by any person after the sale.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Any person entitled to the possession of lands or tenements sold under execution may use and enjoy the premises until the period of redemption has run in the following ways without being guilty of waste:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   He may in all cases use and enjoy the premises sold in the same manner and for the same purposes in and for which they were used and enjoyed prior to the sale, doing no permanent injury to the freehold;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   If the premises sold were buildings or other erections he may make necessary repairs to them although he shall not make alterations in the form or structure of them;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   If the premises sold were land, he may use and improve the land in the ordinary course of husbandry, but he shall not be entitled to any crops growing on the premises at the expiration of the period of redemption;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)   He may apply any wood or timber on the land to the necessary repair of any fences, buildings, or erections which were on the premises at the time of sale;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(v)   If he is in actual occupation of the land sold he may take necessary firewood from the land for the use of his family.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   When an action is prosecuted in any court upon any bond of any public officer, or upon any bond for the breach of any condition, other than the payment of money, or for any penal sum for the nonperformance of any covenant or written agreement, the plaintiff shall assign the specific breaches for which the action is brought, and upon the trial of such action, the verdict and judgment shall be for such damages as are found arising from the specific breaches assigned; and such judgment shall not be a bar to any further action by the same, or any other plaintiff, for any subsequent breaches of the condition of said bond; but said bond shall stand as security for any further or subsequent breaches to the amount of the remainder of the penalty thereof.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   During the pendency of any suit upon such official bond, or after judgment rendered in such suit, any other party aggrieved by the default or delinquency of such officer, may, in like manner prosecute an action upon such official bond; and the pendency of any other suit on the same bond, or a judgment recovered by or against any other person on such bond shall not abate or in any manner affect such suit, or the proceedings therein, except as hereinafter provided.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   No such suit shall be barred, nor shall the amount which the plaintiff may be entitled to recover therein, be affected by any notice given by any surety in such bond, of a judgment recovered thereon, unless it is accompanied by an allegation that the sureties in such bond, some or 1 of them, have been obliged to pay the damages assessed by such judgment, or some part thereof, for want of sufficient property of such officer whereon to levy the same, or that they will be obliged to pay the same, or some part thereof for the same reason; nor unless such notice is verified by the oath of the defendant giving the same.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If it appears that the amount of any damages so recovered, which such surety has been obliged to pay, or will be obliged to pay, as specified in (3), is equal to the amount for which such defendant shall be liable, by virtue of the bond, he shall be acquitted and discharged of all further liability, and judgment shall be rendered in his favor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If it appears that the amount of any damages so recovered, which such surety has been obliged to pay, or which he will be obliged to pay, is not equal to the liability of such surety, the amount thereof shall be allowed to such defendant, in estimating the extent of his liability in any such action.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Whenever a judgment is obtained against an officer and his sureties, a direction shall be endorsed on the execution issued thereon, by the attorney issuing the same, to levy the amount of such execution, in the first place, of the property of such officer, and if sufficient property of such officer cannot be found to satisfy such execution, then to levy the deficiency of the property of the sureties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Whenever several judgments are obtained at the same term, upon any official bond of any officer, for damages, amounting in the whole to more than the sums for which the sureties therein shall be liable, the court shall order the moneys levied upon such judgments from the property of the sureties, to be distributed to the persons for whose use such judgments were recovered respectively, in proportion to the amount of their respective recoveries.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If executions are issued upon several judgments obtained at the same term, upon any such official bond, and sufficient money is not raised to satisfy all of the said executions, the court shall distribute the money collected on such executions to the plaintiffs in proportion to the amount of their respective recoveries.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A tort-feasor who satisfies all or part of a judgment entered in an action for injury or wrongful death is not entitled to contribution if the alleged contributee was not made a party to the action and if a reasonable effort was not made to notify him of the commencement of the action. Upon timely motion, a person receiving such notice may intervene in the action and defend as if joined as a third party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A liability insurer, who by payment has discharged in full or in part the liability of a tort-feasor and has thereby discharged in full its obligation as insurer, is subrogated to the tort-feasor's right of contribution to the extent of the amount it has paid in excess of the tort-feasor's pro rata share of the common liability. It may assert this right either in its own name or in the name of its insured. This provision does not limit or impair any right of subrogation arising from any other relationship.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   This section does not impair any right of indemnity under existing law. Where 1 tort-feasor is entitled to indemnity from another, the right of the indemnity obligee is for indemnity and not contribution, and the indemnity obligor is not entitled to contribution from the obligee for any portion of his indemnity obligation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   This section does not apply to breaches of trust or of other fiduciary obligations.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   This section shall not operate to increase the liability of the secretary of state under Act No. 198 of the Public Acts of 1965, as amended, being sections 257.1101 to 257.1132 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The parties to any mortgage, trust mortgage, or deed of trust of real property, or any extension thereof, may, by agreement herein contained to that effect, provide that the failure of the mortgagor or grantor, as the case may be, to pay any taxes assessed against such property or installments thereof, in the event said taxes are being paid under the provisions of Act No. 126 of the Public Acts of 1933, as amended, or any insurance premium upon policies covering any property located upon such premises constitutes waste.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2928.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The circuit court may order the sale, lease, exchange, conveyance, and if necessary or desirable, the platting, of all or any part of any lands, tenements, and hereditaments held by an infant or other incompetent person, by way of mortgage, in trust only for others, in fee, life tenancy, tenant for years, or in any other way when it appears that the sale, lease, exchange or conveyance is necessary and proper for the support, maintenance and education of the infant or other incompetent or that the interest of such person or the person for whom the property is held will be substantially promoted by the sale, lease, exchange, conveyance or platting. This power shall be exercised in accordance with the rules of court and in the manner and with the restrictions as the court deems expedient.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Whenever it is made to appear to the court that it will be manifestly for the interest and advantage of any infant or other incompetent person that any incumbrance upon the real estate of such person should be purchased and discharged, in whole or in part, the court may authorize the guardian of such person to purchase and discharge the same, and if necessary, to sell and dispose of such part of the real estate of such person as may be necessary for that purpose. Such purchase and discharge shall in no way be construed as vesting in said guardian any right, title or interest in such premises, to the prejudice of such person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   But no real estate or term for years shall be sold, leased or disposed of in any matter against the provisions of any last will, or of any conveyance, by which such estate or term was devised or granted to such infant or other incompetent person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   No sale made as aforesaid of the real estate of any infant or other incompetent person, shall give to such infant or other incompetent person, any other or greater interest or estate in the proceeds of such sale than he had in the estate sold; but the said proceeds shall be deemed real estate of the same nature as the property sold.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   With the consent of the person holding a dower interest in such property, the court may authorize that a lump sum settlement releasing dower be made with such person and taken from the proceeds received.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Every conveyance, lease, or other disposition of the property, and every plat, made pursuant to the order of the court and confirmed by the court, shall be as good and effective in law as if it were made by the infant or other incompetent person, when of lawful age and of sound mind.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The infant or other incompetent person, in an action under this section becomes a ward of the court for the property involved, its proceeds and income, and he and his guardian are subject to periodic orders of the court pertaining thereto.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Proceedings under this section are equitable in nature.</DIV>

If it appears to the best interest of the person for whom the lands, tenements, and hereditaments are held in trust the court may order, direct, and authorize the fiduciary to sell, grant, and convey the lands, tenements, and hereditaments at public or private sale.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Circuit courts may order any lands, tenements, or hereditaments which are held for life, with or without power of appointment by will or sale, or held in trust, without power of sale, sold under the direction of the court, whenever it satisfactorily appears that the rights of the interested parties will otherwise be jeopardized.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Upon making the order of sale the court may order that a bond be given with penalty and sureties, in the form the court directs. This bond shall run to the clerk of the court for the use and benefit of any person who is or may become interested in the lands, tenements, or hereditaments, or their proceeds, conditioned for the investment of and accounting for the proceeds of the lands, tenements, and hereditaments, and for the observance of all orders of the court in relation to the lands, tenements, and hereditaments, and their proceeds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   After the confirmation of the sale, the proceeds of the sale shall stand in lieu of the property sold, and the court shall make such orders as to the investment of the proceeds as may be necessary.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In accordance with the court rules, any person or persons who were stockholders of such corporation while it subsisted and who still retain their rights in the property in question, by virtue of having owned stock therein, and any creditor or creditors of such corporation, whose claims are subsisting and not barred by limitation of time, may appear and defend such action as fully as such corporation could have done while subsisting. Such right to appear and defend may be drawn in question by the plaintiff on the trial of the cause.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   All persons so appearing shall plead together and in the name of the corporation. Service on the corporation, in the manner prescribed by the court rules, is a full and complete service upon such corporation, and upon all persons natural or artificial, interested in said land, because of their having been stockholders in the corporation while subsisting, or creditors thereof. All persons so appearing and defending, or seeking to defend, are liable for costs in the action as fully as such corporation would be if defending.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)(a)   The judgment in such suit shall be against the corporation in the corporate name and shall be binding upon it and upon all persons claiming said land by virtue of their stock in or demands upon the same, and shall be conclusive against such corporation and such persons subject only to such exceptions as are or may be provided by general statute in other actions brought under section 2932.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2942.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If an action contesting the validity of any securities proposed to be issued or any aspect of such validity is brought against any public body, the public body may file a counterclaim against the plaintiff and a third party complaint against the state of Michigan and all persons, resident and nonresident, owning property or subject to taxation in the public body or in the political entity or entities it represents, and all other persons interested in or affected by the issuance of the securities, for the purpose of securing an adjudication, forever conclusive as against all the parties, as to the validity of the securities or as to those issues affecting such validity as are then properly justiciable or become so during the pendency of the proceedings. The court may grant continuances and permit amendments as may be appropriate to enable the issues affecting the validity of the securities to be adjudicated as fully as possible.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The counterclaim and third party complaint shall briefly set out by proper allegation, reference or exhibit, insofar as the circumstances of the case permit, such facts as may be necessary to show the authority of the public body to issue the securities and to take any other action essential to their validity, the taking of all proceedings and other action and the satisfaction of all legal requirements essential to the validity of the securities (including the holding of any required election and the result thereof), the nature and characteristics of the securities (including amount, date, purpose, maturities, maximum interest rate), the source of the funds from which the securities are to be paid, and any other essential matters relevant to the issues upon which an adjudication is sought. In case the public body was established for the purpose of constructing or acquiring a public improvement for which the securities are to be issued, the counterclaim shall also set forth the authority for the creation of the public body.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Upon the filing of the counterclaim and third party complaint, the court shall issue an order in general terms in the form of a notice directed against the plaintiff in the action and against the state of Michigan and, without naming them, all public bodies, property owners, taxpayers, citizens and others having or claiming any right or interest affected in any way by the issuance of the securities, requiring them, in general terms, and the state of Michigan, through its attorney general or his representative, to appear at a time and place designated in the order and show cause why the prayer of the counterclaim and third party complaint should not be granted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A copy of the counterclaim, the third party complaint, and the order shall be served upon the plaintiff in the action and upon the attorney general at least 20 days before the time fixed in the order for the hearing. The attorney general shall carefully examine the counterclaim and third party complaint and if it appears, or there is reason to believe, that it is defective, insufficient or untrue, or if in his opinion the securities have not been duly authorized or cannot be lawfully issued, or the taxes, assessments, rates, tolls or other charges or revenues provided for payment of said securities cannot be lawfully levied, collected and pledged for such purpose, he shall make such defense thereto as may seem proper.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Prior to the date set for hearing, the clerk of the court shall publish a copy of the order once each week for 3 consecutive weeks in each of the newspapers designated below, the first publication in each newspaper to be not less than 20 nor more than 30 days prior to the date set for hearing:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the public body embraces, or the project for which the securities are to be issued extends into, territory in only 1 county, the notice shall be published in the county in a newspaper of general circulation in the territory.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the public body embraces, or the project for which the securities are to be issued extends into, territory in more than 1 but not more than 5 counties, the notice shall be published in each of the counties in a newspaper of general circulation therein.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   If the public body embraces, or the project for which the securities are to be issued extends into, territory in more than 5 counties, the notice shall be published in each of the 5 most populous counties in a newspaper of general circulation therein, and also in a newspaper or newspapers of general circulation in the territory outside of the 5 counties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   If the public body is the state of Michigan (as distinguished from a political subdivision thereof) or any department, commission, agency or official thereof, or if the project extends throughout the state, the notice shall also be published in the county wherein the seat of state government is located, in a newspaper of general circulation therein.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   At least 10 days prior to the date set for the hearing, the clerk of the court shall give such notice of the filing of the counterclaim and the third party complaint and of the hearing on the order to show cause to all known parties as the court shall direct in the order</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Upon motion of the public body, whether before or after the date set for hearing as provided in (3), the court may enjoin the commencement by any person or public body, of any other action contesting the validity of the security issue described in the counterclaim, may order a joint hearing or trial before him of all issues raised by the counterclaim and third party complaint which are then pending in any action or proceeding in any court, may order all such actions or proceedings consolidated with the action pending before him, and may make such orders as may be necessary and proper to effect such consolidation and as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delays and multiplicity of actions. Such order shall not be appealable.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Any public body, property owner, taxpayer, citizen or other person affected by or interested in the issuance of the securities may become a named party to the proceedings by pleading to the third party complaint on or before the time set for hearing as provided in (3) or thereafter by intervention upon leave of court. At the time and place designated in the order for hearing, the court shall proceed to hear and determine all questions of law and fact in the proceedings and may make such orders as to the proceedings and such adjournments as will enable the court properly to try and determine the same and to render a final judgment therein with the least possible delay. Such final judgment shall be based upon a written opinion of the court which shall find the facts specially and shall state separately the court's conclusions of law therein.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   Any parties to the cause, whether plaintiff, defendant, third party plaintiff, third party defendant, intervenor or otherwise, dissatisfied with the final judgment, may appeal therefrom to the supreme court. The supreme court, insofar as practicable, shall expedite and give priority to the hearing and decision on the appeal.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   In the event that the judgment upholds the validity of the securities or such aspects thereof as have been adjudicated, and no appeal is taken therefrom, or if an appeal is taken and the judgment is affirmed, the judgment shall be forever binding and conclusive against the public body and all other parties to the cause, named or unnamed, and shall constitute a permanent injunction against the institution by any person of any action contesting any aspect of the validity of the security issue which has been adjudicated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   For the purposes of this section, the term:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Public body" means the state of Michigan or any political subdivision thereof, including any county, township, city, village, school district, metropolitan district, port district, drainage district, public authority or other political entity, or any department, commission, agency or official of any of the foregoing.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   "Validity" as applied to any securities means the authority of the public body to issue the securities, to levy and collect the taxes, assessments, rates, tolls or other charges or revenues as are provided for the payment thereof, to pledge the same for payment, and to take any action essential to any of the foregoing; and also the legality of all proceedings and other action taken, and the satisfaction of all legal requirements, in connection with the issuance of the securities and the levy and collection of the taxes, assessments, rates, tolls or other charges or revenues and the pledge thereof.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   This section shall be known and may be cited as the "public securities validation act".</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) It is admissible as evidence in a product liability action that the production of the product was in accordance with the generally recognized and prevailing nongovernmental standards in existence at the time the specific unit of the product was sold or delivered by the defendant to the initial purchaser or user.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) In a product liability action brought against a manufacturer or seller for harm allegedly caused by a production defect, the manufacturer or seller is not liable unless the plaintiff establishes that the product was not reasonably safe at the time the specific unit of the product left the control of the manufacturer or seller and that, according to generally accepted production practices at the time the specific unit of the product left the control of the manufacturer or seller, a practical and technically feasible alternative production practice was available that would have prevented the harm without significantly impairing the usefulness or desirability of the product to users and without creating equal or greater risk of harm to others. An alternative production practice is practical and feasible only if the technical, medical, or scientific knowledge relating to production of the product, at the time the specific unit of the product left the control of the manufacturer or seller, was developed, available, and capable of use in the production of the product and was economically feasible for use by the manufacturer. Technical, medical, or scientific knowledge is not economically feasible for use by the manufacturer if use of that knowledge in production of the product would significantly compromise the product's usefulness or desirability.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) With regard to the production of a product that is the subject of a product liability action, evidence of a philosophy, theory, knowledge, technique, or procedure that is learned, placed in use, or discontinued after the event resulting in the death of the person or injury to the person or property, which if learned, placed in use, or discontinued before the event would have made the event less likely to occur, is admissible only for the purpose of proving the feasibility of precautions, if controverted, or for impeachment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In a product liability action brought against a manufacturer or seller for harm allegedly caused by a product, there is a rebuttable presumption that the manufacturer or seller is not liable if, at the time the specific unit of the product was sold or delivered to the initial purchaser or user, the aspect of the product that allegedly caused the harm was in compliance with standards relevant to the event causing the death or injury set forth in a federal or state statute or was approved by, or was in compliance with regulations or standards relevant to the event causing the death or injury promulgated by, a federal or state agency responsible for reviewing the safety of the product. Noncompliance with a standard relevant to the event causing the death or injury set forth in a federal or state statute or lack of approval by, or noncompliance with regulations or standards relevant to the event causing the death or injury promulgated by, a federal or state agency does not raise a presumption of negligence on the part of a manufacturer or seller. Evidence of compliance or noncompliance with a regulation or standard not relevant to the event causing the death or injury is not admissible.</div>

<P>Sec. 2946a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In an action for product liability, the total amount of damages for noneconomic loss shall not exceed $280,000.00, unless the defect in the product caused either the person's death or permanent loss of a vital bodily function, in which case the total amount of damages for noneconomic loss shall not exceed $500,000.00. On the effective date of the amendatory act that added this section, the state treasurer shall adjust the limitations set forth in this subsection so that the limitations are equal to the limitations provided in section 1483. After that date, the state treasurer shall adjust the limitations set forth in this subsection at the end of each calendar year so that they continue to be equal to the limitations provided in section 1483.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In awarding damages in a product liability action, the trier of fact shall itemize damages into economic and noneconomic losses. Neither the court nor counsel for a party shall inform the jury of the limitations under subsection (1). The court shall adjust an award of noneconomic loss to conform to the limitations under subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The limitation on damages under subsection (1) for death or permanent loss of a vital bodily function does not apply to a defendant if the trier of fact determines by a perponderance of the evidence that the death or loss was the result of the defendant's gross negligence, or if the court finds that the matters stated in section 2949a are true.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If damages for economic loss cannot readily be ascertained by the trier of fact, then the trier of fact shall calculate damages for economic loss based on an amount that is equal to the state average median family income as reported in the immediately preceding federal decennial census and adjusted by the state treasurer in the same manner as provided in subsection (1).</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2947.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A manufacturer or seller is not liable in a product liability action for harm caused by an alteration of the product unless the alteration was reasonably foreseeable. Whether there was an alteration of a product and whether an alteration was reasonably foreseeable are legal issues to be resolved by the court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A manufacturer or seller is not liable in a product liability action for harm caused by misuse of a product unless the misuse was reasonably foreseeable. Whether there was misuse of a product and whether misuse was reasonably foreseeable are legal issues to be resolved by the court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A manufacturer or seller is not liable in a product liability action if the purchaser or user of the product was aware that use of the product created an unreasonable risk of personal injury and voluntarily exposed himself or herself to that risk and the risk that he or she exposed himself or herself to was the proximate cause of the injury. This subsection does not relieve a manufacturer or seller from a duty to use reasonable care in a product's production.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Except to the extent a state or federal statute or regulation requires a manufacturer to warn, a manufacturer or seller is not liable in a product liability action for failure to provide an adequate warning if the product is provided for use by a sophisticated user.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 2950l.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and the court shall enforce a foreign protection order other than a conditional release order or probation order issued by a court in a criminal proceeding in the same manner that they would enforce a personal protection order issued in this state under section 2950 or 2950a or section 2(h) of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.2, unless indicated otherwise in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A foreign protection order that is a conditional release order or a probation order issued by a court in a criminal proceeding shall be enforced pursuant to section 2950m of this act, section 15(1)(g) of chapter IV of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 764.15, the uniform criminal extradition act, 1937 PA 144, MCL 780.1 to 780.31, or the uniform rendition of accused persons act, 1968 PA 281, MCL 780.41 to 780.45.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A law enforcement officer may rely upon a copy of any protection order that appears to be a foreign protection order and that is provided to the law enforcement officer from any source if the putative foreign protection order appears to contain all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The names of the parties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The date the protection order was issued, which is prior to the date when enforcement is sought.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The terms and conditions against respondent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The name of the issuing court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The signature of or on behalf of a judicial officer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   No obvious indication that the order is invalid, such as an expiration date that is before the date enforcement is sought.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The fact that a putative foreign protection order that an officer has been shown cannot be verified on L.E.I.N. or the NCIC national protection order file is not grounds for a law enforcement officer to refuse to enforce the terms of the putative foreign protection order, unless it is apparent to the officer that the putative foreign protection order is invalid. A law enforcement officer may rely upon the statement of petitioner that the putative foreign protection order that has been shown to the officer remains in effect and may rely upon the statement of petitioner or respondent that respondent has received notice of that order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a person seeking enforcement of a foreign protection order does not have a copy of the foreign protection order, the law enforcement officer shall attempt to verify through L.E.I.N., or the NCIC protection order file, administrative messaging, contacting the court that issued the foreign protection order, contacting the law enforcement agency in the issuing jurisdiction, contacting the issuing jurisdiction's protection order registry, or any other method the law enforcement officer believes to be reliable, the existence of the foreign protection order and all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The names of the parties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The date the foreign protection order was issued, which is prior to the date when enforcement is sought.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Terms and conditions against respondent.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The name of the issuing court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   No obvious indication that the foreign protection order is invalid, such as an expiration date that is before the date enforcement is sought.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If subsection (5) applies, the law enforcement officer shall enforce the foreign protection order if the existence of the order and the information listed under subsection (5) are verified, subject to subsection (9).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If a person seeking enforcement of a foreign protection order does not have a copy of the foreign protection order, and the law enforcement officer cannot verify the order as described in subsection (5), the law enforcement officer shall maintain the peace and take appropriate action with regard to any violation of criminal law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   When enforcing a foreign protection order, the law enforcement officer shall maintain the peace and take appropriate action with regard to any violation of criminal law. The penalties provided for under sections 2950 and 2950a and chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.1 to 712A.32, may be imposed in addition to a penalty that may be imposed for any criminal offense arising from the same conduct.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   If there is no evidence that the respondent has been served with or received notice of the foreign protection order, the law enforcement officer shall serve the respondent with a copy of the foreign protection order, or advise the respondent about the existence of the foreign protection order, the name of the issuing court, the specific conduct enjoined, the penalties for violating the order in this state, and, if the officer is aware of the penalties in the issuing jurisdiction, the penalties for violating the order in the issuing jurisdiction. The officer shall enforce the foreign protection order and shall provide the petitioner, or cause the petitioner to be provided, with proof of service or proof of oral notice. The officer also shall provide the issuing court, or cause the issuing court to be provided, with a proof of service or proof of oral notice, if the address of the issuing court is apparent on the face of the foreign protection order or otherwise is readily available to the officer. If the foreign protection order is entered into L.E.I.N. or the NCIC protection order file, the officer shall provide the L.E.I.N. or the NCIC protection order file entering agency, or cause the L.E.I.N. or NCIC protection order file entering agency to be provided, with a proof of service or proof of oral notice. If there is no evidence that the respondent has received notice of the foreign protection order, the respondent shall be given an opportunity to comply with the foreign protection order before the officer makes a custodial arrest for violation of the foreign protection order. The failure to comply immediately with the foreign protection order is grounds for an immediate custodial arrest. This subsection does not preclude an arrest under section 15 or 15a of chapter IV of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 764.15 and 764.15a, or a proceeding under section 14 of chapter XIIA of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 712A.14.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   A law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or court personnel acting in good faith are immune from civil and criminal liability in any action arising from the enforcement of a foreign protection order. This immunity does not in any manner limit or imply an absence of immunity in other circumstances.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 2953.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In addition to applicable penal sanctions, a person who commits an act for which he or she could be charged with retail fraud in the first, second, or third degree under sections 356c and 356d of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.356c and 750.356d, is liable to the merchant who is the victim of the act for the full retail price of unrecovered property or recovered property that is not in salable condition, and civil damages of 10 times the retail price of the property, but not less than $50.00 and not more than $200.00.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The merchant who is the victim of retail fraud in the first, second, or third degree, or an agent of the merchant, may make a written demand for payment of the amount for which the person who committed the act is liable under subsection (1). Except for a sole proprietorship, a member of management, other than the initial detaining person, shall evaluate the validity of the accusation that the person committed the act and shall approve the accusation in writing before a written demand for payment is issued. The demand for payment may be delivered to the person from whom payment is demanded by first-class mail. The text of the written demand shall be as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   "We have cause to believe that on (date) you, or your minor child (child's name), committed retail fraud in the first, second, or third degree by (description of action and property involved) in our store or in its immediate vicinity.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   State law authorizes us to demand in writing that you do all of the following, as applicable:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   [   ] Return the property in salable condition or pay to us $ ______, which represents the full retail price or the remaining balance of the full retail price of the property.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   [   ] Pay to us civil damages in an amount equal to 10 times the retail price of the property involved, but not less than $50.00 or more than $200.00, equaling a total amount of $ ______.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   This notice is a formal demand for return of the property involved, if applicable, and the payment of the amounts indicated above, equaling a total amount of $ ______. If you return any unrecovered property and pay the amounts indicated above to us within 30 days after the date this notice was mailed, we will not take any further civil action against you.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   You are not required to respond to this demand if you believe that you or your minor child are not guilty of committing retail fraud or if you choose not to respond. If you fail to comply with this demand, we will be authorized by state law to bring a civil action against you to determine your legal responsibility for the return of any unrecovered property and the payment of the amounts indicated above plus the cost of the action, including reasonable attorney fees.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   These civil proceedings do not prevent criminal prosecution for the alleged act of retail fraud.".</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the person to whom a written demand is made under subsection (2) complies with the written demand within 30 days after the date the written demand is mailed, that person shall incur no further civil liability to the merchant from the act of retail fraud.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A person who commits an act described in subsection (1) and who fails to comply with a written demand under subsection (2) is liable to the merchant for the full retail price of the property, unless the property was recovered in salable condition, plus civil damages of 10 times the retail price of the property but not less than $50.00 or more than $200.00, and costs of the action, including reasonable attorney fees.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a civil action is filed pursuant to this section and before the trial of the action is commenced the person to whom a written demand was made under subsection (2) pays the merchant in cash the amount demanded, subsection (4) does not apply.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   An action under this section may be brought in the small claims division of the district court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction. If the amount demanded exceeds the jurisdiction of the small claims division, the action may still be brought in the small claims division, but the amount recovered shall not exceed the jurisdiction of the small claims division.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A merchant may recover damages in an amount allowable under this section in a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the parent or parents of an unemancipated minor who lives with his or her parent or parents and who commits an act described in subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   A merchant may recover the amount for which a person is civilly liable under this section only if a formal police report is filed with a local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction over the location where the violation took place, which report sets forth facts alleging that the person has committed retail fraud in the first, second, or third degree or violated a local ordinance substantially corresponding to section 218, 356, 356c, or 356d of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.218, 750.356, 750.356c, and 750.356d, regardless of the outcome of any criminal action.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a merchant shall not recover civil damages for an act of retail fraud in the first, second, or third degree with regard to a particular item of property if the merchant violated section 3 of 1976 PA 449, MCL 445.353, with regard to that item of property and the violation was not caused by the person who committed the act of retail fraud.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, in an action based on tort or another legal theory seeking damages for personal injury, property damage, or wrongful death, if a claim against an employer requires proof that the employer was negligent in hiring an individual by disregarding a prior criminal conviction, a certificate of employability issued to an individual under section 34d of the corrections code of 1953, 1953 PA 232, MCL 791.234d, conclusively establishes that the employer did not act negligently in hiring the individual, if the employer knew of the certificate at the time of hire.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) This section does not relieve an employer from a duty or requirement established in another law concerning a background check or verification that an individual is qualified for a position, and does not relieve the employer of liability arising from failure to comply with any such law.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Upon motion of a party within 91 days after identification of a nonparty, the court shall grant leave to the moving party to file and serve an amended pleading alleging 1 or more causes of action against that nonparty.

</P>
<P>Sec. 2963.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a prisoner under the jurisdiction of the department of corrections submits for filing a civil action as plaintiff in a court of this state or submits for filing an appeal in a civil action in a court of this state and states that he or she is indigent and therefore is unable to pay the filing fee and costs required by law, the prisoner making the claim of indigency shall submit to the court a certified copy of his or her institutional account, showing the current balance in the account and a 12-month history of deposits and withdrawals for the account. The court then shall order the prisoner to pay fees and costs as provided in this section. The court shall suspend the filing of the civil action or appeal until the filing fee or initial partial filing fee ordered under subsection (2) or (3) is received by the court. If the court orders that a prisoner pay a filing fee or partial filing fee, all documents submitted by the prisoner that relate to that action or appeal shall be returned to the prisoner by the court along with 2 certified copies of the court order. An additional certified copy of the court order shall be sent to the department of corrections facility where the prisoner is housed. The prisoner then shall, within 21 days after the date of the court order, resubmit to the court all documents relating to the action or appeal, accompanied by the required filing fee or partial filing fee and 1 certified copy of the court order. If the filing fee or initial partial filing fee is not received within 21 days after the day on which it was ordered, the court shall not file that action or appeal, and shall return to the plaintiff all documents submitted by the plaintiff that relate to that action or appeal.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If, upon commencement of the civil action or the filing of the appeal, the balance in the prisoner's institutional account equals or exceeds the full amount of the filing fee required by law, the court shall order the prisoner to pay that amount.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If, upon commencement of the civil action or the filing of the appeal, the balance in the prisoner's institutional account is less than the full amount of the filing fee required by law, the court shall require the prisoner to pay an initial partial filing fee in an amount equal to 50% of the greater of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The average monthly deposits to the prisoner's institutional account for the 12 months preceding the date on which the civil action is commenced or the appeal is filed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The average monthly balance in the prisoner's institutional account for the 12 months preceding the date on which the civil action is commenced or the appeal is filed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In determining the balance in a prisoner's institutional account for purposes of subsection (2) or (3), the court shall disregard amounts in the institutional account that are required by law or by another court order to be paid for any other purposes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   In addition to an initial partial filing fee under subsection (3), the court shall order the prisoner to make monthly payments in an amount equal to 50% of the deposits made to the account. Payments under this subsection shall continue until the full amount of the filing fee is paid. The collection of payments from the account, and their remittal by the department of corrections, shall be conducted as provided in section 68 of 1953 PA 232, MCL 791.268. If costs are assessed against a prisoner, and if the balance of the prisoner's institutional account is not sufficient to pay the full amount of the costs assessed, the court shall order the prisoner to make payments in the same manner required in this section for the payment of filing fees, and the full amount of the costs shall be collected and paid in the manner provided in this subsection and in section 68 of 1953 PA 232, MCL 791.268.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The total amount collected from a prisoner under subsections (3) to (5) shall not exceed the full amount of the filing fee and costs required by law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   For purposes of this section, the fact of a prisoner's incarceration cannot be the sole basis for a determination of indigency. However, this section shall not prohibit a prisoner from commencing a civil action or filing an appeal in a civil action if the prisoner has no assets and no means by which to pay the initial partial filing fee. If the court, pursuant to court rule, waives or suspends the payment of fees and costs in an action described in subsection (1) because the prisoner has no assets and no means by which to pay the initial partial filing fee, the court shall order the fees and costs to be paid by the prisoner in the manner provided in this section when the reason for the waiver or suspension no longer exists.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   A prisoner who has failed to pay outstanding fees and costs as required under this section shall not commence a new civil action or appeal until the outstanding fees and costs have been paid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   If a prisoner is ordered by a court to make monthly payments for the purpose of paying the balance of filing fees or costs under this section, the agency having custody of the prisoner shall remove those amounts from the institutional account of the prisoner subject to the order and, when an amount equal to the balance of the filing fees or costs due is removed, remit that amount as directed in the order.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If there is a settlement of a dispute concerning the insurance coverage between the transferor or successor and its insurers before the effective date of the amendatory act that added this section, the amount of the settlement is the amount of the liability insurance to be included in the total gross assets.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The amount of any liability insurance coverage included in the total gross assets under subsection (7)(b) shall not be included in the adjustment under subsection (9).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The action is filed on or after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Not later than 180 days before the initial date set for the trial of an asbestos action, the plaintiff shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Provide the court and parties with a sworn statement signed by the plaintiff and plaintiff's counsel indicating that an investigation has been conducted and that, based on information reasonably available to the plaintiff and plaintiff's counsel, all asbestos trust claims that can be made by the plaintiff or any person on the plaintiff's behalf have been completed and filed. If the plaintiff or plaintiff's counsel later becomes aware that additional trust claims can be filed, the sworn statement must be supplemented under subsection (2). A deferral or placeholder claim that is missing necessary documentation for the asbestos trust to review and pay the claim does not meet the requirements of this subdivision. The sworn statement must indicate whether there has been a request to defer, delay, suspend, or toll, withdraw, or otherwise alter the standing of any asbestos trust claim, and provide the status and disposition of each asbestos trust claim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Provide all parties with all trust claims materials, including trust claims materials that relate to conditions other than those that are the basis for the asbestos action and including all trust claims materials from all law firms connected to the plaintiff in relation to exposure to asbestos, including anyone at a law firm involved in the asbestos action, any referring law firm, and any other law firm that has filed an asbestos trust claim for the plaintiff or on the plaintiff's behalf. Documents provided under this subdivision must be accompanied by an affidavit certifying that the trust claims materials submitted are true and complete.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the plaintiff's asbestos trust claim is based on exposure to asbestos through another individual, produce all trust claims materials submitted by the other individual to any asbestos trust if the materials are available to the plaintiff or plaintiff's counsel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A plaintiff has a continuing duty to supplement the information and materials required to be provided under subsection (1), and shall do so within 30 days after the plaintiff or a person on the plaintiff's behalf supplements an existing asbestos trust claim, receives additional information or materials related to an asbestos trust claim, or files an additional asbestos trust claim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The court may dismiss the asbestos action if the plaintiff fails to comply with this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Not less than 60 days before trial, the defendant shall confer with the plaintiff if the defendant believes the plaintiff has not filed all asbestos trust claims as required under section 3012. After conferring with the plaintiff under this subsection, the defendant may move the court for an order to require the plaintiff to file additional trust claims. The motion must identify the asbestos trust claims that the defendant believes the plaintiff can file. The defendant shall produce or describe the information it possesses or is aware of in support of the motion. If the defendant has previously filed a motion under this section, the court shall not grant a subsequent motion if the defendant knew that the plaintiff met the criteria for payment for the additional trust claim identified in the subsequent motion at the time the earlier motion was filed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Within 10 days after receiving a motion under subsection (1), the plaintiff shall do 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) File the asbestos trust claims.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) File a written response with the court requesting a determination that the cost to file the asbestos trust claims exceeds the plaintiff's reasonably anticipated recovery.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Within 10 days after the plaintiff files a written response to the defendant's motion, the court shall determine if there is sufficient basis for the plaintiff to file the asbestos trust claims identified in the motion. If the court determines that there is a sufficient basis for the plaintiff to file the asbestos trust claim that is the subject of a motion under subsection (1), the court shall stay the asbestos action until the plaintiff files the asbestos trust claim and produces all related trust claims materials.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the court determines that the cost of submitting an asbestos trust claim that is the subject of a motion under subsection (1) exceeds the plaintiff's reasonably anticipated recovery, the court shall stay the asbestos action until the plaintiff files with the court and provides all parties with a verified statement of the plaintiff's history of exposure to, usage of, or other connection to asbestos covered by the asbestos trust.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   When a complaint is filed in any circuit court for the foreclosure of any trust mortgage or deed of trust given to a trustee or trustees to secure bonds or other obligations issued and authenticated as set forth in the trust instrument, and on the sale of the mortgaged property had under the judgment on the complaint, no bid is made or appears to be obtainable for a sum which in the judgment of the court represents the then fair and reasonable value of the interest in the premises of the holders of the bonds or other obligations secured by the trust mortgage or deed in trust, the court may authorize the trustee or trustees to bid for and acquire the mortgaged property for a sum which in the judgment of the court represents the then fair and reasonable value of the interest. The court shall authorize the trustees to bid only if the court believes that to do so will be for the best interest of the holders of the bonds or obligations as a whole, and only if the persons requesting the authorization shall be representative in number of the persons holding bonds or obligations and hold at least a majority in value of the bonds or obligations.

The bid and acquisition and full title if not redeemed shall be for and on behalf of all holders of the bonds or other obligations secured by the mortgage and then outstanding according to their several and respective interests and the property shall be held and administered accordingly. The bid shall be satisfied by a pro rata credit on each bond or other obligation to the extent of the net distribution which would have been distributed on the bonds or other obligations if the bid were to be paid in cash.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Any property so acquired shall be managed and administered by the trusts under and in accordance with the rules and principles of law and equity pertaining to express trusts generally subject to the jurisdiction of the court to be exercised in the cause by proceedings subsequent to the judgment and order.

The trustee has power and authority to repair, maintain, and operate or lease the property until a sale or other disposal of the property is approved or directed. The trustee may borrow money for the payment of the portion of the bid required to be paid in cash and for any other purpose of the trust or for the benefit of the holders of the bonds, obligations, or beneficial certificates under the trust and secure that borrowed money by mortgage of the property of the trust. This mortgage shall be superior to and binding upon the interests of the holders of the bonds or obligations or beneficial certificates provided for by this section. It is the duty of the trustee to negotiate and effect a sale or other disposal of the property at the earliest time at which it can be done without sacrifice of the fair and reasonable value of the property. Any sale may be for cash or in whole or in part for bonds, notes, debentures, stocks, or other securities. No operating contract which is for more than 2 years or borrowing of money, mortgage, sale, or other disposal shall be made except by and with the approval and authorization of the court upon consent of or due notice to a majority in interest of the then beneficiaries of the trust. The court in the order authorizing the trustee to bid and acquire the property as provided above or by any order made subsequent to it may provide any other terms, conditions, powers, duties, and authority of the trust and of the trustee not inconsistent with the foregoing and any limitations on the foregoing which the court considers just and which are approved by a majority in interest of the beneficiaries of the trust. The court may likewise provide for the surrender and cancellation or for the pro rata cancellation, as the case may be, of the bonds or other obligations and for the issuance of certificates evidencing the beneficial interests in and under the trust. Upon a sale or other disposal of all the trust property and the complete consummation of the disposal the trustee shall render in writing a full and complete report and account of the administration of the trust and of the distribution of the assets of the trust upon which a hearing shall be had after due notice to the holders of beneficial interests whose appearances are then on file. If any trust continues more than 1 year an account and report of its administration shall be rendered when required by the court but at least annually and when any report has been made the final account and report required above shall be required to cover only from the date of the then last account and report.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   This section is intended to be remedial and to be liberally construed and to be supplemented by rule of court if necessary or expedient to the accomplishment or furtherance of its intents and purposes.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Every mortgage of real estate, which contains a power of sale, upon default being made in any condition of such mortgage, may be foreclosed by advertisement, in the cases and in the manner specified in this chapter.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A party may foreclose a mortgage by advertisement if all of the following circumstances exist:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A default in a condition of the mortgage has occurred, by which the power to sell became operative.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An action or proceeding has not been instituted, at law, to recover the debt secured by the mortgage or any part of the mortgage or, if an action or proceeding has been instituted, either the action or proceeding has been discontinued or an execution on a judgment rendered in the action or proceeding has been returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part. For purposes of this subdivision, neither of the following is an action or proceeding to recover the debt:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) An action or proceeding for the appointment of a receiver. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) An action or proceeding under the Michigan uniform assignment of rents act to enforce an assignment of rents.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The party foreclosing the mortgage is either the owner of the indebtedness or of an interest in the indebtedness secured by the mortgage or the servicing agent of the mortgage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a mortgage is given to secure the payment of money by installments, each of the installments mentioned in the mortgage after the first must be treated as a separate and independent mortgage. The mortgage for each of the installments may be foreclosed in the same manner and with the same effect as if a separate mortgage were given for each subsequent installment. A redemption of a sale by the mortgagor has the same effect as if the sale for the installment had been made upon an independent prior mortgage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the party foreclosing a mortgage by advertisement is not the original mortgagee, a record chain of title must exist before the date of sale under section 3216 evidencing the assignment of the mortgage to the party foreclosing the mortgage.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) After a foreclosure sale under this chapter and providing notice under section 3237, the purchaser at the sale may inspect the property, including the exterior and interior of any structures on the property, as provided in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The purchaser may conduct an initial inspection of the interior of any structures on the property. In addition to the notice provided in section 3237, the purchaser shall provide notice to the mortgagor by certified mail, physical posting on the property, or in any manner reasonably calculated to achieve actual notice of the purchaser's intent to inspect the property at least 72 hours in advance and shall set the time of the inspection at a reasonable time of day, in coordination with the mortgagor if possible.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The purchaser may conduct any number of exterior inspections of the property and any structures on the property during the redemption period.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) After the initial inspection described in subsection (2), the purchaser may request by certified mail, physical posting on the property, or in any manner reasonably calculated to achieve actual notice that the mortgagor provide information on or evidence of the condition of the interior of any structures on the property, in any form reasonably necessary to assess the condition of the property. The purchaser shall not make such a request more than once in a calendar month or more often than 3 times in any 6 months of the redemption period, unless the purchaser has reasonable cause to believe that damage to the property is imminent or has occurred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the mortgagor refuses to provide information or evidence requested under subsection (4) within 5 business days after receipt of the request, or if the information or evidence provided reveals that damage has occurred or is imminent, the purchaser may schedule an inspection of the interior of any structures on the property. For an inspection under this subsection, the purchaser shall provide notice as described in subsection (2) of the purchaser's intent to inspect the property at least 72 hours in advance, and shall set the time of the inspection at a reasonable time of day, in coordination with the mortgagor if possible. If the mortgagor provides the information or evidence requested under subsection (4) and damage has not occurred or does not appear imminent, the purchaser shall not conduct an interior inspection under this subsection related to that request.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If an inspection under this section is unreasonably refused or if damage to the property is imminent or has occurred, the purchaser may immediately commence summary proceedings for possession of the property under chapter 57 or file an action for any other relief necessary to protect the property from damage. If a purchaser commences an action for possession or any other relief under this section, the purchaser may also name as a party to the action any person who may redeem the property under section 3240.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Before commencing summary proceedings for possession of the property under this section, the purchaser shall provide notice to the mortgagor by certified mail, physical posting on the property, or in any other manner reasonably calculated to achieve actual notice, that the purchaser intends to commence summary proceedings if the damage or condition causing reasonable belief that damage is imminent is not repaired or corrected within 7 days after receipt of the notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A purchaser shall not commence summary proceedings for possession under this section if either of the following conditions exists:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The damage or condition causing reasonable belief that damage is imminent is repaired or corrected within the 7-day period described in the notice of intent under subsection (7).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The mortgagor and the purchaser agree on procedures and a timeline to repair the damage or correct the condition causing reasonable belief that damage is imminent and the procedures are completed by the original date agreed to by the mortgagor and purchaser or by an extended date that is agreed to by the mortgagor and purchaser.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) In determining whether to enter judgment for possession in favor of the purchaser in summary proceedings under this section, the judge shall consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the damage or condition that threatens imminent damage, including, but not limited to, all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The cause of the damage or condition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Whether the mortgagor has taken appropriate steps to repair the damage or correct the condition and to secure the property from further damage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Whether the mortgagor has promptly contacted the purchaser and any property insurer regarding the damage or condition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Whether any delay in repairs or corrections is affirmatively caused by the purchaser or the property insurer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If a judgment for possession is entered in favor of the purchaser in an action under chapter 57 as described in subsection (6), the right of redemption under section 3240 is extinguished and title to the property vests in the purchaser as provided in section 3236 as to all persons against whom judgment was entered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) As used in this section, "damage" includes, but is not limited to, any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The failure to comply with local ordinances regarding maintenance of the property or blight prevention, if the failure is the subject of enforcement action by the appropriate governmental unit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) An exterior condition that presents a significant risk to the security of the property or significant risk of criminal activity occurring on the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Stripped plumbing, electrical wiring, siding, or other metal material.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A purchaser's deed under section 3232 is void if the mortgagor, the mortgagor's heirs or personal representative, or any person that has a recorded interest in the property lawfully claiming under the mortgagor or the mortgagor's heirs or personal representative redeems the entire premises sold by paying the amount required under subsection (2) and any amount required under subsection (4), within the applicable time limit prescribed in subsections (7) to (12), to the purchaser or the purchaser's personal representative or assigns, or to the register of deeds in whose office the deed is deposited for the benefit of the purchaser.</div>

Except as provided in subsection (14), the register of deeds shall not determine the amount necessary for redemption. The purchaser shall provide an affidavit with the deed to be recorded under this section that states the exact amount required to redeem the property under this subsection, including any daily per diem amounts, and the date by which the property must be redeemed shall be stated on the certificate of sale. The purchaser may include in the affidavit the name of a designee responsible on behalf of the purchaser to assist the person redeeming the property in computing the exact amount required to redeem the property. The designee may charge a fee of not more than $250.00 as stated in the affidavit and may be authorized by the purchaser to receive redemption money. The purchaser shall accept the amount computed by the designee. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a distinct lot or parcel separately sold is redeemed, leaving a portion of the premises unredeemed, the deed is void only to the redeemed parcel or parcels. </div>

This subsection does not apply unless all of the following are filed with the register of deeds with whom the deed is deposited:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An affidavit by the purchaser or someone in his or her behalf who has knowledge of the facts of the payment showing the amount and items paid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The receipt or copy of the canceled check evidencing the payment of the taxes, amounts necessary to redeem senior liens from foreclosure, condominium assessments, homeowner association assessments, community association assessments, or insurance premiums.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An affidavit of an insurance agent of the insurance company stating that the payment was made and what portion of the payment covers the premium for the period before the expiration of the period of redemption.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the redemption payment in subsection (4) includes an amount used to redeem a senior lien from a nonjudicial foreclosure, the mortgagor has the same defenses against the purchaser with respect to the amount used to redeem the senior lien as the mortgagor would have had against the senior lien.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The register of deeds shall indorse on documents filed under subsection (4) the time they are received. The register of deeds shall record the affidavit of the purchaser only and shall preserve in his or her files the recorded affidavit, receipts, insurance receipts, and insurance agent's affidavit until expiration of the period of redemption.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Subject to section 3238, for a mortgage executed on or after January 1, 1965, of commercial or industrial property, or multifamily residential property in excess of 4 units, the redemption period is 6 months from the date of the sale.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Subject to subsections (9) to (11) and section 3238, for a mortgage executed on or after January 1, 1965, of residential property not exceeding 4 units, if the amount claimed to be due on the mortgage at the date of the notice of foreclosure is more than 66-2/3% of the original indebtedness secured by the mortgage, the redemption period is 6 months.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) For a mortgage of residential property not exceeding 4 units, if the property is abandoned as determined under section 3241, the redemption period is 1 month.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If the property is abandoned as determined under section 3241a, the redemption period is 30 days or until the time to provide the notice required by section 3241a(c) expires, whichever is later.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) Subject to section 3238, for a mortgage of property that is used for agricultural purposes, the redemption period is 1 year from the date of the sale.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If subsections (7) to (11) do not apply, and subject to section 3238, the redemption period is 1 year from the date of the sale.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The amount stated in any affidavits recorded under this section is the amount necessary to satisfy the requirements for redemption under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) The register of deeds of a county with a population of more than 750,000 and less than 1,500,000, at the request of a person entitled to redeem the property under this section, shall determine the amount necessary for redemption. In determining the amount, the register of deeds shall consider only the affidavits recorded under subsections (2) and (4). A county, register of deeds, or employee of a county or register of deeds is not liable for damages proximately caused by an incorrect determination of an amount necessary for redemption under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) A register of deeds may charge not more than $50.00 for determining the amount necessary for redemption under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) For purposes of this section, there is a presumption that the property is used for agricultural purposes if, before the foreclosure sale under this chapter, the mortgagor provides the party foreclosing the mortgage and the foreclosing party's attorney proof that the mortgagor filed a schedule F to the mortgagor's federal income tax form 1040 for the year preceding the year in which the proceedings to foreclose the mortgage were commenced and records an affidavit with the register of deeds for the county in which the property is located stating that the proof has been delivered. If the mortgagor fails to provide proof and record an affidavit as required by this subsection before the foreclosure sale, there is a presumption that the property is not used for agricultural purposes. The party foreclosing the mortgage or the mortgagor may file a civil action to produce evidence to rebut a presumption created by this subsection. An action under this subsection must be filed before the expiration of the redemption period that would apply if the property is determined not to be used for agricultural purposes.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A garnishment proceeding shall not be commenced against a person for money owing to a defendant on account of labor performed by the defendant until after the plaintiff's claim has been reduced to judgment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A sheriff or other public officer is not subject to garnishment for money or things received or collected by him or her pursuant to an execution or other legal process in the favor of the defendant or because of any money in his or her hands for which he or she is accountable merely as a public officer to the defendant.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A garnishment of periodic payments remains in effect until the balance of the judgment is satisfied.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) A garnishee is not liable for a garnishment of periodic payments under subsection (1) to the extent that the garnishee is required to satisfy another garnishment against the same defendant having a higher priority or having the same priority but received at an earlier date. For purposes of this subsection, garnishments have priority in the order in which they are received. Both of the following have priority over a garnishment, regardless of the order in which they are received:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An order of income withholding as that term is defined in section 2 of the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.602.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A levy of this state or a governmental unit of this state to satisfy a tax liability.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a garnishment of periodic payments is suspended pursuant to an order under sections 6201 to 6251 and the order is subsequently set aside, the garnishment retains its priority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A garnishment of periodic payments or a notice of failure is not valid or enforceable unless the garnishment is served on the garnishee in accordance with the Michigan court rules.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) While a garnishment of periodic payments is in effect, the plaintiff shall do both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) At least once every 6 months after the plaintiff receives the first payment under the garnishment, provide to the garnishee and defendant a statement setting forth the balance remaining on the judgment, including interest and costs. A failure to send a timely statement under this subdivision does not affect the garnishment or any obligation of the garnishee under the garnishment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Within 21 days after the balance of the judgment has been paid in full, including all interest and costs, provide to the garnishee and defendant a release of garnishment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A plaintiff shall not request that a default be entered against a garnishee under a garnishment of periodic payments unless both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the garnishee fails to file a disclosure within 14 days after service of the garnishment or fails to perform any other required act, the plaintiff has served on the garnishee a notice of failure setting forth the required act or acts that the garnishee has failed to perform.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The garnishee has failed, within 28 days after the date of service of the notice of failure under subdivision (a), to cure the identified failure by mailing to the plaintiff and defendant a disclosure certifying that the garnishee will immediately begin withholding any available funds pursuant to the garnishment as provided by statute or court rule, or has commenced performing any other required act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The plaintiff shall attach to a request for entry of a default as allowed under subsection (6) proof of serving the notice of failure. The plaintiff shall send a copy of the request for entry of a default by certified mail to the garnishee at the garnishee's principal place of business or registered agent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) After entry of a default under subsection (6) and before entry of a default judgment, the garnishee may cure the identified failure by mailing to the court, plaintiff, and defendant a disclosure certifying that the garnishee will immediately begin withholding any available funds pursuant to the garnishment as provided by statute or court rule or that it has commenced performing any other required act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) After a default has been entered under subsection (6), the plaintiff may file with the court a request for default judgment for an amount that does not exceed the full amount of the unpaid judgment, interest, and costs, as stated in the request and garnishment. The plaintiff shall send a copy of the request for default judgment by certified mail to the garnishee at the garnishee's principal place of business or resident agent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) On motion of the garnishee filed within 21 days after entry of a default judgment under subsection (9), the court shall do 1 or more of the following, as applicable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the garnishee certifies by affidavit that its failure to comply with the garnishment was inadvertent or caused by an administrative error, mistake, or other oversight and it will immediately begin withholding any available funds or immediately begin performing any other required act pursuant to the garnishment as provided by statute or court rule, reduce the default judgment to not more than the amount that would have been withheld if the garnishment had been in effect for 56 days.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If any of the following circumstances exist, set aside the default judgment:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The garnishee was not liable to the defendant for any periodic payments after service of the garnishment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The garnishment, notice of failure, request for entry of a default, or request for default judgment was not properly served or sent as required by this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The notice of failure was materially inaccurate or incomplete.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) A garnishee may recover an amount for which the garnishee is liable because of the entry of a default judgment under subsection (9) or (10) from future periodic payments to the defendant as provided in section 7 of 1978 PA 390, MCL 408.477.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Except as otherwise provided by statute, a plaintiff shall pay a fee of $35.00 to the garnishee at the time a garnishment of periodic payments is served on the garnishee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) This section does not apply to any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An order of income withholding as that term is defined in section 2 of the support and parenting time enforcement act, 1982 PA 295, MCL 552.602.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A levy for tax liability.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A levy under section 15(m) of the Michigan employment security act, 1936 (Ex Sess) PA 1, MCL 421.15.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) As used in this section and section 8410a, "periodic payments" means wages, salary, commissions, and other earnings, land contract payments, rent, and other periodic debt or contract payments that are or become payable during the effective period of the garnishment. Periodic payments do not mean any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Payments by a financial institution of interest on a deposit account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Charges made by a financial institution automatically against an account that are applied to a debt under an automatic payment authorization executed by the account owner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Payments made by a financial institution to honor a check or draft or to comply with an account holder's order of withdrawal of funds from an account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Interest earned on a certificate of deposit that is paid into a deposit account.</div>

Upon intercepting a state tax refund or credit pursuant to a writ of garnishment, the state treasurer shall do all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Calculate the amount available from the interception to satisfy all or part of the garnishment, and within 90 days after establishing other liability for which the state tax refund or credit may be applied under section 30a of Act No. 122 of the Public Acts of 1941, being section 205.30a of the Michigan Compiled Laws, do both of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   File with the court a verified disclosure that identifies the intercepted amount, less any setoff, counterclaim, or other demand of the state against the defendant.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Serve upon the plaintiff and defendant a copy of the disclosure described in subparagraph (i).</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A disclosure described in subsection (1) is not required to be made under oath.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The state's liability to the plaintiff under a writ of garnishment issued under this section is limited to the amount of the tax refund or credit due to the defendant for the period the writ is in effect, less any setoff, counterclaim, or other demand of the state against the defendant. As used in this subsection, "state" includes the state treasurer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If all or a portion of an intercepted state tax refund or credit is deposited with the clerk of the court under subsection (1), the court shall convey the deposited amount to the plaintiff's attorney of record in the garnishment action or, if the plaintiff is not represented by counsel, to the plaintiff.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The attorney general, or the prosecuting attorney or the city or township attorney for the local unit of government in which the property is located, may apply ex parte for an order authorizing the filing of a lien notice against real property subject to forfeiture under this chapter.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A person who did not have prior knowledge of, or consent to the commission of, the crime, or a transferee under section 4703(7), may move the court having jurisdiction to return the property or discharge the lien on the grounds that the property was illegally seized, that the property is not subject to forfeiture under this chapter, or that the person has an ownership or security interest in the property and did not have prior knowledge of, or consent to the commission of, the crime, or acquired an ownership or security interest by a transfer that is not void under section 4703(7). The court shall hear the motion within 28 days after the motion is filed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) At the hearing on the motion filed under subsection (1), the attorney general, or the prosecuting attorney or the city or township attorney for the local unit of government in which the property was seized or the lien was filed, shall establish the following:</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 5072.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The court shall not order a party to participate in arbitration unless each party to the domestic relations matter acknowledges, in writing or on the record, that he or she has been informed in plain language of all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Arbitration is voluntary.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Arbitration is binding and the right of appeal is limited.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Arbitration is not recommended for cases involving domestic violence.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Arbitration may not be appropriate in all cases.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   The arbitrator's powers and duties are delineated in a written arbitration agreement that all parties must sign before arbitration commences.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   During arbitration, the arbitrator has the power to decide each issue assigned to arbitration under the arbitration agreement. The court will, however, enforce the arbitrator's decisions on those issues.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   The party may consult with an attorney before entering into the arbitration process or may choose to be represented by an attorney throughout the entire process.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   If the party cannot afford an attorney, the party may wish to seek free legal services, which may or may not be available.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   A party to arbitration will be responsible, either solely or jointly with other parties, to pay for the cost of the arbitration, including fees for the arbitrator's services. In comparison, a party does not pay for the court to hear and decide an issue, except for payment of filing and other court fees prescribed by statute or court rule for which the party is responsible regardless of the use of arbitration.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If either party is subject to a personal protection order involving domestic violence or if, in the pending domestic relations matter, there are allegations of domestic violence or child abuse, the court shall not refer the case to arbitration unless each party to the domestic relations matter waives this exclusion. A party cannot waive this exclusion from arbitration unless the party is represented by an attorney throughout the action, including the arbitration process, and the party is informed on the record concerning all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The arbitration process.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The suspension of the formal rules of evidence.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The binding nature of arbitration.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If, after receiving the information required under subsection (2), a party decides to waive the domestic violence exclusion from arbitration, the court and the party's attorney shall ensure that the party's waiver is informed and voluntary. If the court finds a party's waiver is informed and voluntary, the court shall place those findings and the waiver on the record.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A child abuse or neglect matter is specifically excluded from arbitration under this act.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 5201.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   All assignments commonly called common law assignments for the benefit of creditors are void unless the same are without preferences as between such creditors and are of all the property of the assignor not exempt from execution, and the instrument of assignment (or a duplicate thereof), a list of creditors of the assignor, and a bond for the faithful performance of the trust by the assignee are filed in the office of the clerk of the circuit court where said assignor resides, or if he is not a resident of the state, then of the county where the assigned property is principally located, within 10 days after the making thereof.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   No attachment or execution levied upon any assigned property of such assignor after such assignment and before the expiration of the time provided herein for filing such bond, is valid, and does not create any lien upon such property.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   That the rent allegedly due, in an action where possession is claimed for nonpayment of rent, was paid into an escrow account under section 130 of Act No. 167 of the Public Acts of 1917, being section 125.530 of the Michigan Compiled Laws; was paid pursuant to a court order under section 134(5) of Act No. 167 of the Public Acts of 1917, as amended, being section 125.534 of the Michigan Compiled Laws; or was paid to a receiver under section 135 of Act No. 167 of the Public Acts of 1917, being section 125.535 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a defendant who alleges a retaliatory termination of the tenancy shows that within 90 days before the commencement of summary proceedings the defendant attempted to secure or enforce rights against the plaintiff or to complain against the plaintiff, as provided in subsection (1)(a), (b), (c), or (e), by means of official action to or through a court or other governmental agency and the official action has not resulted in dismissal or denial of the attempt or complaint, a presumption in favor of the defense of retaliatory termination arises, unless the plaintiff establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the termination of tenancy was not in retaliation for the acts. If the defendant's alleged attempt to secure or enforce rights or to complain against the plaintiff occurred more than 90 days before the commencement of proceedings or was terminated adversely to the defendant, a presumption adverse to the defense of retaliatory termination arises and the defendant has the burden to establish the defense by a preponderance of the evidence.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an action involving a claim based on medical malpractice may be commenced at any time within the applicable period prescribed in section 5805 or sections 5851 to 5856, or within 6 months after the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the existence of the claim, whichever is later. However, except as otherwise provided in section 5851(7) or (8), the claim shall not be commenced later than 6 years after the date of the act or omission that is the basis for the claim. The burden of proving that the plaintiff, as a result of physical discomfort, appearance, condition, or otherwise, neither discovered nor should have discovered the existence of the claim at least 6 months before the expiration of the period otherwise applicable to the claim is on the plaintiff.

</P>
<P>Sec. 5851.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (7) and (8), if the person first entitled to make an entry or bring an action under this act is under 18 years of age or insane at the time the claim accrues, the person or those claiming under the person shall have 1 year after the disability is removed through death or otherwise, to make the entry or bring the action although the period of limitations has run. This section does not lessen the time provided for in section 5852.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The term insane as employed in this chapter means a condition of mental derangement such as to prevent the sufferer from comprehending rights he or she is otherwise bound to know and is not dependent on whether or not the person has been judicially declared to be insane.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   To be considered a disability, the infancy or insanity must exist at the time the claim accrues. If the disability comes into existence after the claim has accrued, a court shall not recognize the disability under this section for the purpose of modifying the period of limitations.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A person shall not tack successive disabilities. A court shall recognize only those disabilities that exist at the time the claim first accrues and that disable the person to whom the claim first accrues for the purpose of modifying the period of limitations.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A court shall recognize both of the disabilities of infancy or insanity that disable the person to whom the claim first accrues at the time the claim first accrues. A court shall count the year of grace provided in this section from the termination of the last disability to the person to whom the claim originally accrued that has continued from the time the claim accrued, whether this disability terminates because of the death of the person disabled or for some other reason.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   With respect to a claim accruing before the effective date of the age of majority act of 1971, Act No. 79 of the Public Acts of 1971, being sections 722.51 to 722.55 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, the disability of infancy is removed as of the effective date of Act No. 79 of the Public Acts of 1971, as to persons who were at least 18 years of age but less than 21 years of age on January 1, 1972, and is removed as of the eighteenth birthday of a person who was under 18 years of age on January 1, 1972.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (8), if, at the time a claim alleging medical malpractice accrues to a person under section 5838a the person has not reached his or her eighth birthday, a person shall not bring an action based on the claim unless the action is commenced on or before the person's tenth birthday or within the period of limitations set forth in section 5838a, whichever is later. If, at the time a claim alleging medical malpractice accrues to a person under section 5838a, the person has reached his or her eighth birthday, he or she is subject to the period of limitations set forth in section 5838a.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If, at the time a claim alleging medical malpractice accrues to a person under section 5838a, the person has not reached his or her thirteenth birthday and if the claim involves an injury to the person's reproductive system, a person shall not bring an action based on the claim unless the action is commenced on or before the person's fifteenth birthday or within the period of limitations set forth in section 5838a, whichever is later. If, at the time a claim alleging medical malpractice accrues to a person under section 5838a, the person has reached his or her thirteenth birthday and the claim involves an injury to the person's reproductive system, he or she is subject to the period of limitations set forth in section 5838a. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   If a person was serving a term of imprisonment on the effective date of the 1993 amendatory act that added this subsection, and that person has a cause of action to which the disability of imprisonment would have been applicable under the former provisions of this section, an entry may be made or an action may be brought under this act for that cause of action within 1 year after the effective date of the 1993 amendatory act that added this subsection, or within any other applicable period of limitation provided by law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   If a person died or was released from imprisonment at any time within the period of 1 year preceding the effective date of the 1993 amendatory act that added this subsection, and that person had a cause of action to which the disability of imprisonment would have been applicable under the former provisions of this section on the date of his or her death or release from imprisonment, an entry may be made or an action may be brought under this act for that cause of action within 1 year after the date of his or her death or release from imprisonment, or within any other applicable period of limitation provided by law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   As used in this section, "release from imprisonment" means either of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A final release or discharge from imprisonment in a county jail.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Release on parole or a final release or discharge from imprisonment in a state or federal correctional facility.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) For complaints filed before June 1, 1980, in an action involving other than a written instrument having a rate of interest exceeding 6% per year, the interest on the judgment is calculated from the date of filing the complaint to June 1, 1980, at the rate of 6% per year and on and after June 1, 1980, to the date of satisfaction of the judgment at the rate of 12% per year compounded annually.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) For a complaint filed before June 1, 1980, in an action involving a written instrument having a rate of interest exceeding 6% per year, the interest on the judgment is calculated from the date of filing the complaint to the date of satisfaction of the judgment at the rate specified in the instrument if the rate was legal at the time the instrument was executed. However, the rate after the date judgment is entered shall not exceed either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Seven percent per year compounded annually for a period of time between the date judgment is entered and the date of satisfaction of the judgment that elapses before June 1, 1980.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Thirteen percent per year compounded annually for a period of time between the date judgment is entered and the date of satisfaction of the judgment that elapses after May 31, 1980.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) For a complaint filed on or after June 1, 1980, but before January 1, 1987, interest is calculated from the date of filing the complaint to the date of satisfaction of the judgment at the rate of 12% per year compounded annually unless the judgment is rendered on a written instrument having a higher rate of interest. In that case, interest is calculated at the rate specified in the instrument if the rate was legal at the time the instrument was executed. The rate under this subsection shall not exceed 13% per year compounded annually after the date judgment is entered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as provided in subsection (6), for a complaint filed on or after January 1, 1987, but before July 1, 2002, if a judgment is rendered on a written instrument, interest is calculated from the date of filing the complaint to the date of satisfaction of the judgment at the rate of 12% per year compounded annually, unless the instrument has a higher rate of interest. In that case, interest shall be calculated at the rate specified in the instrument if the rate was legal at the time the instrument was executed. The rate under this subsection shall not exceed 13% per year compounded annually after the date judgment is entered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For a complaint filed on or after January 1, 1987, but before July 1, 2002, if the civil action has not resulted in a final, nonappealable judgment as of July 1, 2002, and if a judgment is or has been rendered on a written instrument that does not evidence indebtedness with a specified interest rate, interest is calculated as provided in subsection (8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For a complaint filed on or after July 1, 2002, if a judgment is rendered on a written instrument evidencing indebtedness with a specified interest rate, interest is calculated from the date of filing the complaint to the date of satisfaction of the judgment at the rate specified in the instrument if the rate was legal at the time the instrument was executed. If the rate in the written instrument is a variable rate, interest shall be fixed at the rate in effect under the instrument at the time the complaint is filed. The rate under this subsection shall not exceed 13% per year compounded annually. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (5) and (7) and subject to subsection (13), for complaints filed on or after January 1, 1987, interest on a money judgment recovered in a civil action is calculated at 6-month intervals from the date of filing the complaint at a rate of interest equal to 1% plus the average interest rate paid at auctions of 5-year United States treasury notes during the 6 months immediately preceding July 1 and January 1, as certified by the state treasurer, and compounded annually, according to this section. Interest under this subsection is calculated on the entire amount of the money judgment, including attorney fees and other costs. In an action for medical malpractice, interest under this subsection on costs or attorney fees awarded under a statute or court rule is not calculated for any period before the entry of the judgment. The amount of interest attributable to that part of the money judgment from which attorney fees are paid is retained by the plaintiff, and not paid to the plaintiff's attorney. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If a bona fide, reasonable written offer of settlement in a civil action based on tort is made by the party against whom the judgment is subsequently rendered and is rejected by the plaintiff, the court shall order that interest is not allowed beyond the date the bona fide, reasonable written offer of settlement is filed with the court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (1) and subject to subsections (11) and (12), if a bona fide, reasonable written offer of settlement in a civil action based on tort is not made by the party against whom the judgment is subsequently rendered, or is made and is not filed with the court, the court shall order that interest be calculated from the date of filing the complaint to the date of satisfaction of the judgment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If a civil action is based on medical malpractice and the defendant in the medical malpractice action failed to allow access to medical records as required under section 2912b(5), the court shall order that interest be calculated from the date notice was given in compliance with section 2912b to the date of satisfaction of the judgment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) If a civil action is based on medical malpractice and the plaintiff in the medical malpractice action failed to allow access to medical records as required under section 2912b(5), the court shall order that interest be calculated from 182 days after the date the complaint was filed to the date of satisfaction of the judgment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (1), if a bona fide, reasonable written offer of settlement in a civil action based on tort is made by a plaintiff for whom the judgment is subsequently rendered and that offer is rejected and the offer is filed with the court, the court shall order that interest be calculated from the date of the rejection of the offer to the date of satisfaction of the judgment at a rate of interest equal to 2% plus the rate of interest calculated under subsection (8).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) A bona fide, reasonable written offer of settlement made according to this section that is not accepted within 21 days after the offer is made is rejected. A rejection under this subsection or otherwise does not preclude a later offer by either party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) As used in this section:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Bona fide, reasonable written offer of settlement" means either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) With respect to an offer of settlement made by a defendant against whom judgment is subsequently rendered, a written offer of settlement that is not less than 90% of the amount actually received by the plaintiff in the action through judgment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) With respect to an offer of settlement made by a plaintiff, a written offer of settlement that is not more than 110% of the amount actually received by the plaintiff in the action through judgment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Defendant" means a defendant, a counter-defendant, or a cross-defendant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) "Party" means a plaintiff or a defendant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) "Plaintiff" means a plaintiff, a counter-plaintiff, or a cross-plaintiff.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Upon inventory and appraisal, the defendant in execution, or his authorized agent, may select from the inventory the number of items or animals, or the amount of property not exceeding, according to the inventory and appraisal, the number, amount, or value exempted by law from execution. If no selection is made within 10 days following completion of inventory and appraisal, the officer shall make it.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Whenever a levy is made upon, or the clerk of any court advertises for sale under any judgment upon the foreclosure of any mortgage not valid as against the homestead and so stated in the judgment, the lands and tenements of a householder whose homestead has not been platted and set apart by metes and bounds, the householder shall notify the officer at the time of making the levy or at the time of the advertising for sale what he regards as his homestead, with a description thereof, within the limits above prescribed, and the remainder alone is subject to sale under the levy or judgment. If at the time of the levy or advertising for sale the householder fails to notify the officer making the levy or advertising the property for sale, what he regards as his homestead with a description thereof, the officer making the levy or advertising the property for sale, shall call upon the householder to make his selection of a homestead out of the land, describing it minutely. If after the notice the owner of the land fails to select his homestead, the officer may select the homestead out of the land for him and the remainder over and above that part selected by the officer or by the owner of the land alone is subject to sale under the levy or judgment. If the officer making the levy or advertising the property for sale makes the selection of the homestead out of the lands levied upon or advertised for sale, he shall select lands in compact form, which shall include the dwelling house and its appurtenances thereon.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the plaintiff in execution or in the judgment is dissatisfied with the quantity of land selected and set apart as aforesaid either by the owner of the land or by the officer making the levy or advertising the land for sale, he shall cause it to be surveyed beginning at a point to be designated by the owner or by the officer making the levy or advertising for sale, and set off land in compact form including the dwelling house and its appurtenances, to the amount specified in section 6023. The expense of the survey is chargeable on the execution or judgment and collectible thereupon.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   After the survey is made, the officer may sell the property levied upon or included in the judgment, and not included in the set off, in the same manner as provided in other like cases for the sale of real estate. In giving a deed of the property he may describe it according to the original levy or as described in the judgment, excepting therefrom by metes and bounds, according to the certificate of the survey, the quantity as set off as aforesaid.</DIV>

If at the sale no bid is made for such property, in excess of the amount of the exemption allowed therein, such property shall not be sold, but shall be returned to the defendant. If the defendant in execution, before such sale, pays to the officer the difference between the appraised value of such property, and the amount of the exemption therein, not to exceed the amount due on such execution with costs of such levy, to be applied upon the execution, such property shall not be sold, but shall be returned to the defendant: Provided, That if after such officer has completed the levy upon such property, the defendant in execution gives to such officer a sufficient bond, to be approved by him, conditioned that said defendant will deliver said property to such officer or before the time of sale, pay to him the difference between the appraised value of such property, and the amount of his exemption, not to exceed the amount due on such execution with costs accrued, then such officer may permit such defendant to have possession of such property during the period intervening between the making of the levy and the time of sale.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Any creditor of a person against whom the execution issues having in his own name, or as assignee, representative, trustee, or otherwise, a judgment under which execution has issued and levied upon the real estate sold, or a judgment which is a lien without execution and levy, or any purchaser at a subsequent sale under a junior levy whose title has not become absolute, at any time before the expiration of 15 months from the time of the sale, by paying the sum of money which was paid on the sale of the premises, together with the interest thereon, computed at the rate borne by the judgment under which the sale was made, from the time of the sale, shall acquire all the rights of the original purchaser, subject to be defeated in the manner hereinafter mentioned.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the execution issued and levied under the creditor's judgment, or the judgment is a lien upon any lot, tract, or parcel, that has been separately sold, the creditor having the same by paying as before provided the sum bid for the lot, tract, or parcel, with interest as above mentioned, shall acquire all the rights of the original purchaser to the lot, tract, or parcel, subject to be defeated as hereinafter provided.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the execution so levied, or the judgment, is a lien only on a specific portion of a lot, tract, or parcel sold, the creditor may acquire the title of the purchaser to the whole of the lot, tract, or parcel, in the same manner as if the lien extended to the whole.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A creditor having the judgment or execution so levied or any purchaser at a subsequent sale under a junior levy whose title has not become absolute, which is a lien upon any undivided share or interest in any real estate sold under execution, may, within the same time, on the same terms, and in the same manner, acquire the title of the original purchaser to the share or interest by paying such part of the whole purchase money of the real estate as shall be in just proportion to the share or interest.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   By reimbursing to the first creditor, his personal representatives, or assigns, the sum which may have been paid by him to acquire the title, together with interest thereon, computed as hereinbefore provided, from the time of the payment to the time of the reimbursement;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the levy under the execution or judgment, by virtue of which the first creditor acquired the title of the original purchaser, be prior to the levy or judgment of the second creditor, then the second creditor shall also pay to the first creditor the amount due on his judgment;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   But if the levy under the execution or the judgment of the first creditor, at the time of his acquiring the title of the original purchaser, shall have ceased to be a lien as against the second creditor, it shall not be necessary to pay the amount thereof.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In the same manner any third or other creditor or purchaser at subsequent sale under a junior levy whose title has not become absolute, who might, according to the foregoing provisions, acquire the title of the original purchaser, may become a purchaser thereof, from the second, third, or any other creditor, who may have become such purchaser from any other creditor upon the same terms and conditions specified in (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the original purchaser of any premises sold, is also a creditor of the defendant against whom the execution issued, and as such might acquire the title of any purchaser, according to the preceding provisions, he may avail himself of his judgment in the same manner, and on the same terms herein prescribed, to acquire the title which any creditor may have obtained.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The plaintiff under whose execution any real estate has been sold shall not acquire the title of the original purchaser, or of any creditor, to the premises sold, by virtue of the judgment on which the execution issued; but if he has any other judgment which would entitle him to acquire the title, according to the preceding provisions, he may avail himself of the other judgment, in the same manner, and on the same terms as any other creditor.</DIV>

The creditor shall also reimburse, with interest, the amount paid by the mortgagee, his representatives, or assigns, to acquire the rights of the original purchaser.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A person arrested on civil process and brought before the proper judge for hearing, may controvert any of the facts and circumstances on which the warrant issued, and may, at his option, verify his allegations by his own affidavit. In such case the plaintiff may examine the defendant on oath touching any fact or circumstance material to the inquiry. The answers of the defendant on the examination shall be reduced to writing, and subscribed by him. The judge conducting the inquiry shall also receive such other proofs as the parties may offer, either at the time of the first appearance, or at such other time as the hearing shall be adjourned to. In case of an adjournment, the judge may take a recognizance with surety from the defendant for his appearance at the adjourned meeting, and conditioned that the defendant will not meanwhile secrete, destroy, dispose of, or in any manner make away with, or put out of his possession, any of his property not exempt from sale on execution.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The judge conducting the inquiry has the same authority to issue subpoenas for witnesses, to enforce obedience to the subpoenas, and to punish witnesses refusing to testify as is conferred by law upon such judges in cases of other proceedings before them. The defendant may demand a jury of 6 jurors to try the issue joined in the matters charged or alleged against him in the affidavit or affidavits exhibited to or before the judge conducting the inquiry. The jury shall be selected and summoned in the same manner, as near as may be, as in the trial of criminal cases. The judge has the same power in relation to the selection, summoning, and swearing the jury and conducting the jury trial, as near as may be, as in the trial of criminal cases.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 6093.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Whenever judgment is recovered against any township, village, or city, or against the trustees or common council, or officers thereof, in any action prosecuted by or against them in their name of office, the clerk of the court shall, on the application of the party in whose favor judgment is rendered, his attorney, executor, administrator, or assigns, make and deliver to the party so applying a certified transcript of the judgment, showing the amount and date thereof, with the rate of interest thereon, and of the costs as taxed under the seal of the court, if in a court having a seal. The party obtaining the certified transcript may file it with the supervisor of the township, if the judgment is against the township, or with the assessing officer or officers of the city or village, if the judgment is against a city or village. The supervisor or assessing officer receiving the certified transcript or transcripts of judgment shall proceed to assess the amount thereof with the costs and interests from the date of rendition of judgment to the time when the warrant for the collection thereof will expire upon the taxable property of the township, city, or village upon the then next tax roll of such township, city, or village, without any other or further certificate than the certified transcript as a part of the township, city, or village tax, adding the total amount of the judgment to the other township, city, or village taxes and assessing it in the same column with the general township, city, or village tax.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The supervisor or assessing officer shall set forth in the warrant attached to the tax roll each judgment separately, stating the amount thereof and to whom payable, and it shall be collected and returned in the same manner as other taxes. The supervisor or assessing officer, at the time when he delivers the tax roll to the treasurer or collecting officer of any township, city, or village, shall deliver to the township clerk or to the clerk or recording officer of the city or village, a statement in writing under his hand, setting forth in detail and separately the judgment stating the amount with costs and interest as herein provided, and to whom payable. The treasurer or collecting officer of the township, city, or village, shall collect and pay the judgment to the owner thereof or his attorney, on or before the date when the tax roll and warrant shall be returnable. In case any supervisor, treasurer, or other assessing or collecting officer neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of this section he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 and costs of prosecution, or imprisonment in the county jail for a period not exceeding 3 months, or by both fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to exclude other remedies given by law for the enforcement of the judgment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In any case where a judgment is recovered against a village which, by reason of holding no municipal elections, or for any other reason has no available assessing officer within the jurisdiction of the court wherein the judgment is rendered, the owner of the judgment or any person knowing the facts, acting on behalf of the owner, may make an affidavit showing that the village against which a judgment is pending and unsatisfied, has no available assessing officer within the jurisdiction, and file it with the clerk of the court wherein the judgment is written. The officer who makes the certified transcript shall attach thereto a copy of the affidavit, the correctness of which copy shall also be certified to in the certificate. Any party receiving the certified transcript of judgment and affidavit may file it with the supervisor of the township in which the village, having no assessing officer is located. The supervisor shall assess the amount of the judgment with costs and interest, upon the taxable property of the village, which is without an assessing officer, and thereafter the same steps and proceedings shall be had in the premises as though it were a judgment against the township within which the village is located, except that it shall be assessed against the property within the corporate limits of the village only.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   When judgment is recovered against any county or the board of supervisors or any county officer in an action prosecuted by or against him in his name of office, the judgment unless reversed shall be levied and collected as other county charges, and when collected shall be paid by the county treasurer to the person to whom the judgment has been adjudged upon the delivery of a proper voucher therefor.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Whether or not the judgment creditor has resorted to any remedy available under the garnishment or execution statutes, the court may order the judgment debtor to pay to the judgment creditor or apply on the judgment, in installments, such portion of his income, however or whenever earned or acquired, as the court may deem proper, after due regard for the reasonable requirements of the judgment debtor and his family, if dependent upon him, as well as any payments required to be made by the judgment debtor under any legal process.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Where the judgment debtor claims or is proved to be rendering services to or employed by a relative or other person or by a corporation owned or controlled by a relative or other person, without salary or compensation, or at a salary or compensation so inadequate as to satisfy the court that such salary or compensation is merely colorable and designed to defraud or impede the creditors of such debtor, the court may direct such debtor to make payments on account of the judgment, in installments, based upon a reasonable value of the services rendered by such judgment debtor under his said employment or upon said debtor's then earning ability.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 6303.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In a personal injury action in which the plaintiff seeks to recover for the expense of medical care, rehabilitation services, loss of earnings, loss of earning capacity, or other economic loss, evidence to establish that the expense or loss was paid or is payable, in whole or in part, by a collateral source shall be admissible to the court in which the action was brought after a verdict for the plaintiff and before a judgment is entered on the verdict. Subject to subsection (5), if the court determines that all or part of the plaintiff's expense or loss has been paid or is payable by a collateral source, the court shall reduce that portion of the judgment which represents damages paid or payable by a collateral source by an amount equal to the sum determined pursuant to subsection (2). This reduction shall not exceed the amount of the judgment for economic loss or that portion of the verdict which represents damages paid or payable by a collateral source.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The court shall determine the amount of the plaintiff's expense or loss which has been paid or is payable by a collateral source. Except for premiums on insurance which is required by law, that amount shall then be reduced by a sum equal to the premiums, or that portion of the premiums paid for the particular benefit by the plaintiff or the plaintiff's family or incurred by the plaintiff's employer on behalf of the plaintiff in securing the benefits received or receivable from the collateral source.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Within 10 days after a verdict for the plaintiff, plaintiff's attorney shall send notice of the verdict by registered mail to all persons entitled by contract to a lien against the proceeds of plaintiff's recovery. If a contractual lien holder does not exercise the lien holder's right of subrogation within 20 days after receipt of the notice of the verdict, the lien holder shall lose the right of subrogation. This subsection shall only apply to contracts executed or renewed on or after the effective date of this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   As used in this section, "collateral source" means benefits received or receivable from an insurance policy; benefits payable pursuant to a contract with a health care corporation, dental care corporation, or health maintenance organization; employee benefits; social security benefits; worker's compensation benefits; or medicare benefits. Collateral source does not include life insurance benefits or benefits paid by a person, partnership, association, corporation, or other legal entity entitled by law to a lien against the proceeds of a recovery by a plaintiff in a civil action for damages. Collateral source does not include benefits paid or payable by a person, partnership, association, corporation, or other legal entity entitled by contract to a lien against the proceeds of a recovery by a plaintiff in a civil action for damages, if the contractual lien has been exercised pursuant to subsection (3).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   For purposes of this section, benefits from a collateral source shall not be considered payable or receivable unless the court makes a determination that there is a previously existing contractual or statutory obligation on the part of the collateral source to pay the benefits.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 6304.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In an action based on tort or another legal theory seeking damages for personal injury, property damage, or wrongful death involving fault of more than 1 person, including third-party defendants and nonparties, the court, unless otherwise agreed by all parties to the action, shall instruct the jury to answer special interrogatories or, if there is no jury, shall make findings indicating both of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The total amount of each plaintiff's damages.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The percentage of the total fault of all persons that contributed to the death or injury, including each plaintiff and each person released from liability under section 2925d, regardless of whether the person was or could have been named as a party to the action.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In determining the percentages of fault under subsection (1)(b), the trier of fact shall consider both the nature of the conduct of each person at fault and the extent of the causal relation between the conduct and the damages claimed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The court shall determine the award of damages to each plaintiff in accordance with the findings under subsection (1), subject to any reduction under subsection (5) or section 2955a or 6303, and shall enter judgment against each party, including a third-party defendant, except that judgment shall not be entered against a person who has been released from liability as provided in section 2925d. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Liability in an action to which this section applies is several only and not joint. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (6), a person shall not be required to pay damages in an amount greater than his or her percentage of fault as found under subsection (1). This subsection and section 2956 do not apply to a defendant that is jointly and severally liable under section 6312.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   In an action alleging medical malpractice, the court shall reduce an award of damages in excess of 1 of the limitations set forth in section 1483 to the amount of the appropriate limitation set forth in section 1483. The jury shall not be advised by the court or by counsel for either party of the limitations set forth in section 1483 or any other provision of section 1483.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If an action includes a medical malpractice claim against a person or entity described in section 5838a(1), 1 of the following applies:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   If the plaintiff is determined to be without fault under subsections (1) and (2), the liability of each defendant is joint and several, whether or not the defendant is a person or entity described in section 5838a(1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If the plaintiff is determined to have fault under subsections (1) and (2), upon motion made not later than 6 months after a final judgment is entered, the court shall determine whether all or part of a party's share of the obligation is uncollectible from that party, and shall reallocate any uncollectible amount among the other parties, whether or not another party is a person or entity described in section 5838a(1), according to their respective percentages of fault as determined under subsection (1). A party is not required to pay a percentage of any uncollectible amount that exceeds that party's percentage of fault as determined under subsection (1). The party whose liability is reallocated continues to be subject to contribution and to any continuing liability to the plaintiff on the judgment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   Notwithstanding subsection (6), a governmental agency, other than a governmental hospital or medical care facility, is not required to pay a percentage of any uncollectible amount that exceeds the governmental agency's percentage of fault as determined under subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   As used in this section, "fault" includes an act, an omission, conduct, including intentional conduct, a breach of warranty, or a breach of a legal duty, or any conduct that could give rise to the imposition of strict liability, that is a proximate cause of damage sustained by a party.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The judgment entered by the court of claims upon any claim described in subsection (1), either against or in favor of the state or any of its departments or officers, upon becoming final is res judicata of that claim. Upon the trial of any cause in which any demand is made by the state or any of its departments or officers against the claimant either by way of setoff, recoupment, or cross declaration, the court shall hear and determine each claim or demand, and if the court finds a balance due from the claimant to the state, the court shall render judgment in favor of the state for the balance. Writs of execution or garnishment may issue upon the judgment the same as from the circuit court of this state. The judgment entered by the court of claims upon any claim, either for or against the claimant, is final unless appealed from as provided in this chapter.</div>

<P>Sec. 6455.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Interest shall not be allowed upon any claim up to the date of the rendition of judgment by the court, unless upon a contract expressly stipulating for the payment of interest. All judgments from the date of the rendition of the judgment shall carry interest at the rate of 12% per annum compounded annually, except that judgment upon a contract expressly providing for interest shall carry interest at the rate provided by the contract in which case provision to that effect shall be incorporated in the judgment entered. This subsection shall apply to any civil action based on tort filed on or after July 9, 1984 but before January 1, 1987 and any action pending before the court of claims on July 9, 1984. This subsection shall apply to any action, other than a civil action based on tort, filed on or after July 1, 1984 and any action pending before the court of claims on July 9, 1984.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, for complaints filed on or after January 1, 1987, interest on a money judgment recovered in a civil action shall be calculated from the date of filing the complaint at a rate of interest which is equal to 1% plus the average interest rate paid at auctions of 5-year United States treasury notes during the 6 months immediately preceding July 1 and January 1, as certified by the state treasurer, and compounded annually, pursuant to this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   For complaints filed on or after October 1, 1986, interest shall not be allowed on future damages from the date of filing the complaint to the date of entry of the judgment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If a bona fide, reasonable written offer of settlement in a civil action based on tort is made by the party against whom the judgment is subsequently rendered, the court shall order that interest shall not be allowed beyond the date the written offer of settlement which is made and rejected by the plaintiff, and is filed with the court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3), if a bona fide, reasonable written offer of settlement in a civil action based on tort is not made by the party against whom the judgment is subsequently rendered, or is made and that offer is not filed with the court, the court shall order that interest be calculated from the date of filing the complaint to the date of satisfaction of the judgment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3), if a bona fide, reasonable written offer of settlement in a civil action based on tort is made by a plaintiff for whom the judgment is subsequently rendered and that offer is rejected and the offer is filed with the court, the court shall order that interest be calculated from the date of the rejection of the offer to the date of satisfaction of the judgment at a rate of interest equal to 2% plus the rate of interest computed under subsection (2).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   An offer made pursuant to this section which is not accepted within 21 days after the offer is made shall be considered rejected. A rejection, under this subsection or otherwise, does not preclude a later offer by either party.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   As used in this section:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   "Bona fide, reasonable written offer of settlement" means:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   With respect to an offer of settlement made by a defendant against whom judgment is subsequently rendered, an offer of settlement that is not less than 90% of the amount actually received by the plaintiff in the action through judgment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   With respect to an offer of settlement made by a plaintiff, an offer of settlement that is not more than 110% of the amount actually received by the plaintiff in the action through judgment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Defendant" means a defendant, a counter-defendant, or a cross-defendant.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   "Party" means a plaintiff or a defendant.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In rendering any judgment against the state, or any department, commission, board, institution, arm, or agency, the court shall determine and specify in that judgment the department, commission, board, institution, arm, or agency from whose appropriation that judgment shall be paid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Upon any judgment against the state or any department, commission, board, institution, arm, or agency becoming final, or upon allowance of any claim by the state administrative board and upon certification by the secretary of the state administrative board to the clerk of the court of claims, the clerk of the court shall certify to the state treasurer the fact that that judgment was entered or that the claim was allowed and the claim shall thereupon be paid from the unencumbered appropriation of the department, commission, board, institution, arm, or agency if the state treasurer determines the unencumbered appropriation is sufficient for the payment. In the event that funds are not available to pay the judgment or allowed claim, the state treasurer shall instruct the clerk of the court of claims to issue a voucher against an appropriation made by the legislature for the payment of judgment claims and allowed claims. In the event that funds are not available to pay the judgment or allowed claim, that fact, together with the name of the claimant, date of judgment, date of allowance of claim by the state administrative board and amount shall be reported to the legislature at its next session, and the judgment or allowed claim shall be paid as soon as money is available for that purpose.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The clerk shall approve vouchers under the direction of the court for the payment of the several judgments rendered by the court.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in subsection (4), the fifty-fourth-a district consists of the city of Lansing, is a district of the third class, and has 4 judges. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as provided in subsection (4), the fifty-fourth-b district consists of the city of East Lansing, is a district of the third class, and has 2 judges.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as provided in subsection (4), the fifty-fifth district consists of the county of Ingham except the cities of Lansing and East Lansing, is a district of the second class, and has 2 judges.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the governing body of the county of Ingham and the cities of Lansing and East Lansing approve by resolutions the consolidation of the fifty-fourth-a, fifty-fourth-b, and fifty-fifth districts before November 1, 2019, all of the following apply beginning March 1, 2020:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The fifty-fourth-a and fifty-fourth-b districts are abolished. The fifty-fifth district consists of all of the territory of the former fifty-fourth-a and fifty-fourth-b district courts and the fifty-fifth district court prior to the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subdivision, the newly constituted fifty-fifth district is a district of the first class, and has 8 judges.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) All full-time employees of the former fifty-fourth-a and fifty-fourth-b districts must be transferred to the fifty-fifth district under this subsection.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) By proposing or authorizing the consolidation of the fifty-fourth-a, fifty-fourth-b, and fifty-fifth districts, the legislature is not creating a new obligation for any affected district control unit. If a district control unit, acting through its governing body, approves the consolidation, then the approval constitutes an exercise of the district control unit's option to increase the level of activity and service offered in that district control unit beyond that required by existing law, as the elements of that option are provided by 1979 PA 101, MCL 21.231 to 21.244, and a voluntary acceptance by that district control unit of all expenses and capital improvements that may result from the consolidation of the districts. However, the exercise of the option does not affect the state's obligation to pay the same portion of each judge's salary that is paid by the state to other district judges as provided by law, or to appropriate and disburse funds to the district control unit for the necessary costs of state requirements established by a state law that takes effect on or after December 23, 1978.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the consolidated district is created under subsection (4), all of the following apply until 8 years after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The fifty-fifth district is divided into the following election divisions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The first division consists of the city of Lansing and the township of Lansing and has 4 judges.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The second division consists of the city of East Lansing and has 2 judges.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The third division consists of the county of Ingham, except the cities of Lansing and East Lansing and the township of Lansing, and has 2 judges.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Each incumbent district judge from the former fifty-fourth-a and fifty-fourth-b districts and the fifty-fifth district shall serve as a district judge in the consolidated district. Each judge from the former fifty-fourth-a and fifty-fourth-b districts and the fifty-fifth district is considered an incumbent in the election division created under subdivision (a) in which he or she resides. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Upon the expiration of 8 years after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection, the election divisions created under subsection (5) are abolished and the judges of the fifty-fifth district must be elected at large. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the consolidated district is created under subsection (4), a jury trial in the fifty-fifth district conducted in connection with a criminal offense or any other cause of action that occurred in the city of Lansing or the township of Lansing must be before a jury of citizens who are residents of those 2 political subdivisions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If the consolidated district is created under subsection (4), a jury trial in the fifty-fifth district conducted in connection with a criminal offense or any other cause of action that occurred in the city of East Lansing must be before a jury of citizens who are residents of that political subdivision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If the consolidated district is created under subsection (4), a jury trial in the fifty-fifth district conducted in connection with a criminal offense or any other cause of action that occurred in the county of Ingham, except for the cities of Lansing and East Lansing or the township of Lansing, must be before a jury of citizens who are residents of the county of Ingham, except for the cities of Lansing or East Lansing or the township of Lansing.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) By proposing or authorizing the consolidation of the sixty-seventh and sixty-eighth districts, the legislature is not creating a new obligation for any affected district control unit. If a district control unit, acting through its governing body, approves the consolidation, then the approval constitutes an exercise of the district control unit's option to increase the level of activity and service offered in that district control unit beyond that required by existing law, as the elements of that option are provided by 1979 PA 101, MCL 21.231 to 21.244, and a voluntary acceptance by that district control unit of all expenses and capital improvements that may result from the consolidation of the districts. However, the exercise of the option does not affect the state's obligation to pay the same portion of each judge's salary that is paid by the state to other district judges as provided by law, or to appropriate and disburse funds to the district control unit for the necessary costs of state requirements established by a state law that takes effect on or after December 23, 1978.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Sections 8177 and 8178 do not apply to the consolidation of the sixty-seventh and sixty-eighth districts.</div>

<P>Sec. 8175.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The additional district judgeships permitted by this chapter shall not be authorized to be filled by election unless each district control unit of the district, by resolution adopted by the governing body of the district control unit, approves the creation of that judgeship and unless the clerk of each district control unit adopting such a resolution files a copy of the resolution with the state court administrator not later than 4 p.m. of the sixteenth Tuesday preceding the August primary for the election to fill the additional district judgeship. The state court administrator shall immediately notify the elections division of the department of state with respect to each new district judgeship authorized pursuant to this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A resolution required under subsection (1) that is filed before the effective date of the amendatory act that authorized that judgeship is a valid approval of the judgeship for purposes of this section only if the filing occurs within the 2-year state legislative session during which the amendatory act was enacted. A resolution required under subsection (1) that is filed after the effective date of the amendatory act that added that judgeship is a valid approval of the judgeship for purposes of this section only if the filing occurs not later than 4 p.m. of the sixteenth Tuesday preceding the August primary for the election immediately preceding the effective date of the additional judgeship.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   By permitting an additional judgeship, the legislature is not creating that judgeship. If a district control unit, acting through its governing body, approves the creation of an additional district judgeship, that approval constitutes an exercise of the district control unit's option to provide a new activity or service or to increase the level of activity or service offered in the district control unit beyond that required by existing law, as the elements of that option are defined by Act No. 101 of the Public Acts of 1979, being sections 21.231 to 21.244 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, and a voluntary acceptance by the district control unit of all expenses and capital improvements which may result from the creation of the judgeship. However, the exercise of the option does not affect the state's obligation to pay the same portion of the additional judge's salary which is paid by the state to the other district judges in the same district, or to appropriate and disburse funds to the district control unit for the necessary costs of state requirements established by a state law which becomes effective on or after December 23, 1978.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Each additional district judgeship created pursuant to subsection (1) shall be filled by election pursuant to the Michigan election law, Act No. 116 of the Public Acts of 1954, as amended, being sections 168.1 to 168.992 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. The first term of each additional district judgeship shall be 6 years, unless the law permitting the additional judgeship provides for a term of a different length.</DIV>

If another judicial office of the same court is to be filled by election in the same circuit, county, or district, a candidate for a new judgeship authorized in that circuit, county, or district by this amendatory act shall indicate, at the time of filing nominating petitions, whether the candidate is filing for a new judgeship or for 1 of the other judicial offices of the same court to be filled by election in 1980. Petitions for a new judgeship created pursuant to this amendatory act shall bear signatures affixed to the petition after the date by which all counties in the circuit, all district control units in the district, or, in the case of a probate judgeship, the county, have adopted the resolutions required by law to create that office. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a nonreturnable filing fee of $250.00 may be paid up to 4 p.m. on June 3, 1980 in lieu of petitions for new judgeships authorized by this 1980 amendatory act which are to be filled by election in 1980.“Additional circuit judgeship for third judicial circuit; terms.“Section 3. If the additional circuit judgeship permitted by this amendatory act for the third judicial circuit is created pursuant to law, the candidate receiving the highest number of votes in the 1980 general election shall be elected for a term of 8 years, and the candidate receiving the second highest number of votes shall be elected for a term of 6 years.“Additional circuit judgeship for sixteenth judicial circuit; term.“Section 4.

<P>Sec. 8707.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An authorized local official who witnesses a person violate an ordinance a violation of which is a municipal civil infraction shall prepare and subscribe, as soon as possible and as completely as possible, an original and 3 copies of a citation, except as provided in subsection (6).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An authorized local official may issue a citation to a person if, based upon investigation, the official has reasonable cause to believe that the person is responsible for a municipal civil infraction. An authorized local official may issue a citation to a person if, based upon investigation of a complaint by someone who allegedly witnessed the person violate an ordinance a violation of which is a municipal civil infraction, the official has reasonable cause to believe that the person is responsible for a municipal civil infraction and if the prosecuting attorney or other attorney for the political subdivision employing the authorized local official approves in writing the issuance of the citation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as otherwise provided under subsection (4), the authorized local official shall personally serve the third copy of the citation upon the alleged violator.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In a municipal civil infraction action involving the use or occupancy of land or a building or other structure, a copy of the citation need not be personally served upon the alleged violator but may be served upon an owner or occupant of the land, building, or structure by posting the copy on the land or attaching the copy to the building or structure. In addition, a copy of the citation shall be sent by first-class mail to the owner of the land, building, or structure at the owner's last known address.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A citation served under subsection (4) for a violation involving the use or occupancy of land or a building or other structure shall be processed in the same manner as a citation served personally upon a defendant pursuant to subsection (1) or (2).</DIV>

If an authorized local official issues and serves a municipal ordinance violation notice and if an admission of responsibility is not made and the civil fine and costs, if any, prescribed by ordinance for the violation are not paid at the municipal ordinance violations bureau, a citation may be filed with the court described in section 8703(4) and a copy of the citation may be served by first-class mail upon the alleged violator at his or her last known address. The citation filed with the court pursuant to this subsection need not comply in all particulars with sections 8705 and 8709 but shall consist of a sworn complaint containing the allegations stated in the municipal ordinance violation notice and shall fairly inform the defendant how to respond to the citation. A citation issued under this subsection shall be processed in the same manner as a citation issued personally to a defendant pursuant to subsection (1) or (2). As used in this subsection, "municipal ordinance violation notice" means a notice, other than a citation, directing a person to appear at a municipal ordinance violations bureau in the city, village, township, or county in which the notice is issued and to pay the fine and costs, if any, prescribed by ordinance for the violation of the ordinance.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Unless the defendant shows that the default was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the order of the court or to a failure on his or her part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for payment, the court shall find that the default constitutes a civil contempt and may order the defendant committed until all or a specified part of the amount due is paid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If it appears that the default in the payment of a fine, costs, assessment, or damages or expenses does not constitute civil contempt, the court may enter an order allowing the defendant additional time for payment, reducing the amount of payment or of each installment, or revoking the fine, costs, assessment, or damages or expenses.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The term of imprisonment on civil contempt for nonpayment of a civil fine, costs, assessment, or damages or expenses shall be specified in the order of commitment and shall not exceed 1 day for each $30.00 due. A person committed for nonpayment of a civil fine, costs, assessment, or damages or expenses shall be given credit toward payment for each day of imprisonment and each day of detention in default of recognizance before judgment at the rate of $30.00 per day.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A defendant committed to imprisonment for civil contempt for nonpayment of a civil fine, costs, assessment, or damages or expenses shall not be discharged from custody until 1 of the following occurs:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The defendant is credited with the amount due pursuant to subsection (5).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The amount due is collected through execution of process or otherwise.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The amount due is satisfied pursuant to a combination of subdivisions (a) and (b).</DIV>

<P>Sec. 8731.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a defendant does not pay a civil fine, costs, or assessment or an installment ordered under section 8727 within 30 days after the date on which payment is due under section 8727 in a municipal civil infraction action brought for a violation involving the use or occupation of land or a building or other structure, the plaintiff may obtain a lien against the land, building, or structure involved in the violation by recording a copy of the court order requiring payment of the fines, costs, and assessment with the register of deeds for the county in which the land, building, or structure is located. The court order shall not be recorded unless a legal description of the property is incorporated in or attached to the court order. The lien is effective immediately upon recording of the court order with the register of deeds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The court order recorded with the register of deeds shall constitute notice of the pendency of the lien. In addition, a written notice of the lien shall be sent by the plaintiff by first-class mail to the owner of record of the land, building, or structure at the owner's last known address.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The lien may be enforced and discharged by a county, city, village, or township in the manner prescribed by its charter, by the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157, or by an ordinance duly passed by the governing body of the county, city, village, or township. However, property is not subject to sale under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157, for nonpayment of a civil fine, costs, or assessment or an installment ordered under section 8727 unless the property is also subject to sale under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.157, for delinquent property taxes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A lien created under this section has priority over any other lien unless 1 or more of the following apply:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The other lien is a lien for taxes or special assessments.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The other lien is created before May 1, 1994.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Federal law provides that the other lien has priority.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The other lien is recorded before the lien under this section is recorded.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   A political subdivision may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for the collection of the judgment imposed by a court order for a municipal civil infraction. However, an attempt by a county, city, village, or township to collect the judgment by any process does not invalidate or waive the lien upon the land, building, or structure.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A lien provided for by this section shall not continue for a period longer than 5 years after a copy of the court order imposing a fine, costs, or assessment is recorded, unless within that time an action to enforce the lien is commenced.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 8733.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An authorized local official may seize and impound a vehicle operated in the commission of a trailway municipal civil infraction. Upon impoundment, the vehicle is subject to a lien, subordinate to a prior lien of record, in the amount of any fine, costs, or assessment that the defendant may be ordered to pay under section 8727 and any expenses described in subsection (2) that the defendant may be ordered to pay under section 8727. The defendant or a person with an ownership interest in the vehicle may post with the court a cash or surety bond in the amount of $750.00. If such a bond is posted, the vehicle shall be released from impoundment. The vehicle shall also be released, and the lien shall be discharged, upon a judicial determination that the defendant is not responsible for the trailway municipal civil infraction or upon payment of the fine, costs, assessment, and damages and expenses.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In a trailway municipal civil infraction action, an order under section 8727 may require the defendant to pay 1 or both of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The amount of damages to any land, water, wildlife, vegetation, or other natural resource or to any facility damaged by the violation of the ordinance. Money collected under this subdivision shall be distributed to the governmental entity that has jurisdiction over the recreational trailway.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The reasonable expense of impoundment under subsection (1). Money collected under this subdivision shall be distributed to the governmental entity employing the authorized local official who impounded the vehicle involved in the trailway municipal civil infraction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the court determines that the defendant is responsible for the trailway municipal civil infraction and the defendant defaults in the payment of the fine, costs, assessment, or damages or expenses, or in any installment, as ordered pursuant to section 8727, any bond posted under subsection (1) shall be forfeited and applied to the fine, costs, assessment, damages, expenses, or installment. The court shall certify any remaining unpaid amount to the attorney for the governmental entity whose ordinance was violated. The attorney for the governmental entity may enforce the lien by a foreclosure sale. The foreclosure sale shall be conducted in the manner provided and subject to the same rights as apply in the case of execution sales under sections 6031, 6032, 6041, 6042, and 6044 to 6047. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Not less than 21 days before the foreclosure sale, the attorney for the governmental entity whose ordinance was violated shall by certified mail send written notice of the time and place of the foreclosure sale to each person with a known ownership interest in or lien of record on the vehicle. In addition, not less than 10 days before the foreclosure sale, the attorney shall twice publish notice of the time and place of the foreclosure sale in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the vehicle was seized. The proceeds of the foreclosure sale shall be distributed in the following order of priority:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   To discharge any lien on the vehicle that was recorded prior to the creation of the lien under subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   To the clerk of the court for the payment of the fine, costs, assessment, damages, and expenses that the defendant was ordered to pay under section 8727.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   To discharge any lien on the vehicle that was recorded after the creation of the lien under subsection (1).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   To the owner of the vehicle.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 8829.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If a defendant defaults in the payment of a civil fine, costs, or assessment or of any installment, as ordered pursuant to section 8827, the court, upon the motion of the plaintiff or upon its own motion, may require the defendant to show cause why the default should not be treated as in civil contempt and may issue a summons, order to show cause, or a bench warrant of arrest for the defendant's appearance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a corporation or an association is ordered to pay a civil fine, costs, or assessment, the individuals authorized to make disbursement shall pay the fine or costs, and their failure to do so shall be civil contempt unless they make the showing required in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Unless the defendant shows that the default was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the order of the court or to a failure on his or her part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for payment, the court shall find that the default constitutes a civil contempt and may order the defendant committed until all or a specified part of the civil fine, costs, or assessment, or any combination of those amounts, is paid.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If it appears that the default in the payment of a fine, costs, or assessment does not constitute civil contempt, the court may enter an order allowing the defendant additional time for payment, reducing the amount of payment or of each installment, or revoking the fine or costs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The term of imprisonment on civil contempt for nonpayment of a civil fine, costs, or assessment shall be specified in the order of commitment and shall not exceed 1 day for each $30.00 of the fine and costs. A person committed for nonpayment of a civil fine or costs shall be given credit toward payment for each day of imprisonment and each day of detention in default of recognizance before judgment at the rate of $30.00 per day.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A defendant committed to imprisonment for civil contempt for nonpayment of a civil fine, costs, or assessment shall not be discharged from custody until 1 of the following occurs:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The defendant is credited with the amount due pursuant to subsection (5).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The amount due is collected through execution of process or otherwise.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The amount due is satisfied pursuant to a combination of subdivisions (a) and (b).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The civil contempt shall be purged upon discharge of the defendant pursuant to subsection (6).</DIV>

Commencing with the 1968 general elections, the number of district judges to be elected in a district of the third class or an election division thereof shall be reduced by the number of municipal and associate municipal judges made district judges under this subsection. As the term of each such municipal and associate municipal judge becoming a judge of the district court expires, the number of district judges to be elected within such district or election division thereof shall be increased by 1.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Effective January 1, 1971, the district court shall function in those districts in which municipal courts were retained under section 9928 except as otherwise provided in subsection (8). In such districts, district judges shall be elected in 1970 as provided in chapter 21a of Act No. 116 of the Public Acts of 1954, being sections 168.467 to 168.467m of the Compiled Laws of 1948.

The district court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine all cases transferred under this section. All causes of action so transferred shall be as valid and subsisting as they were in the court from which they were transferred. All orders and judgments entered prior to January 1, 1971, by municipal courts abolished by this section shall be appealable in like manner and to the same courts as applicable prior to January 1, 1971.</DIV>

Under this subsection the term "municipal judge" or "municipal judges" shall be deemed to include an associate municipal judge only if such associate municipal judge is prohibited from practicing law pursuant to city charter or ordinance.

A local funding unit may report additional 1990-91 fiscal year trial court operational expenses if the information on the expenses that has already been reported to the state court administrative office is incomplete or incorrect and the additional information is confirmed by an independent audit, paid for by the local funding unit and approved by the state court administrator. Information confirmed by an independent audit shall be included by the state court administrative office in its calculation of trial court operational expenses under this subsection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The state court administrative office shall monitor the trends in the ratio of trial court operational expenses to court revenues for each county and district funding unit. In analyzing differences in the ratio of court operational expenses to court revenues for a county or district funding unit from the ratio of expenses to court revenues based on expense data reported by that county or district funding unit for 1990-91 and court revenue data reported by that county or district funding unit for 1990-91, the state court administrator shall consider changes in fees impacting revenue generation, changes in court responsibilities impacting workload, statewide trends in expenses to revenue ratios, and increases in expenses due to inflation. Upon determining that the ratio of expenses to court revenues for a county and district funding unit differs significantly from statewide trends, the state court administrator shall conduct a review of the budget and court management of the court or courts funded by that county or district funding unit. The state court administrator shall then submit a report to the senate and house appropriations subcommittees on general government. In the following state fiscal year, the legislature may authorize adjustments to the funding from the state court fund created in section 151a for which those counties or district funding units would otherwise be entitled pursuant to this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The funds to which a county or district funding unit is entitled under subsection (1) shall be offset by the sum of court revenues collected by that county or district funding unit in the 1990-91 state fiscal year and any state funding in the 1990-91 fiscal year received by the county or district funding unit for trial court operational expenses, including judges' salaries, Michigan friend of the court funds, and child care funds. The amount of the offset of court revenues shall be equal to the percentage of trial court operational expenses funded for that county, or, in the case of a district of the third class, that district funding unit. However, an offset under this subsection shall not reduce the funding to which the county or district control unit is entitled to less than zero.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   As used in this section, "court revenues" means all fees, fines, and court costs, except the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Penal fines.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Revenue dedicated to the state general fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Revenue dedicated to a restricted state fund or state purpose.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Revenue dedicated to a friend of the court fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   A county or political subdivision shall receive funds under this section based on the trial court operational expenses of the courts in the county for which the county or a political subdivision of the county is responsible, offset by the portion of court revenues from those courts to which the county or political subdivision is entitled.</DIV>
