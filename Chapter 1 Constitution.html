<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A person who, within the 15 years immediately preceding a motion for bail pending the disposition of an indictment for a violent felony or of an arraignment on a warrant charging a violent felony, has been convicted of 2 or more violent felonies under the laws of this state or under substantially similar laws of the United States or another state, or a combination thereof, only if the prior felony convictions arose out of at least 2 separate incidents, events, or transactions.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A person who is indicted for, or arraigned on a warrant charging, murder or treason.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A person who is indicted for, or arraigned on a warrant charging, criminal sexual conduct in the first degree, armed robbery, or kidnapping with intent to extort money or other valuable thing thereby, unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is not likely to flee or present a danger to any other person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   A person who is indicted for, or arraigned on a warrant charging, a violent felony which is alleged to have been committed while the person was on bail, pending the disposition of a prior violent felony charge or while the person was on probation or parole as a result of a prior conviction for a violent felony.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If a person is denied admission to bail under this section, the trial of the person shall be commenced not more than 90 days after the date on which admission to bail is denied. If the trial is not commenced within 90 days after the date on which admission to bail is denied and the delay is not attributable to the defense, the court shall immediately schedule a bail hearing and shall set the amount of bail for the person.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   As used in this section, "violent felony" means a felony, an element of which involves a violent act or threat of a violent act against any other person.</DIV>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>§ 4 Place and manner of elections.</B><P>Sec. 4.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Every citizen of the United States who is an elector qualified to vote in Michigan shall have the following rights:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The fundamental right to vote, including but not limited to the right, once registered, to vote a secret ballot in all elections. No person shall: (1) enact or use any law, rule, regulation, qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure; (2) engage in any harassing, threatening, or intimidating conduct; or (3) use any means whatsoever, any of which has the intent or effect of denying, abridging, interfering with, or unreasonably burdening the fundamental right to vote.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Any Michigan citizen or citizens shall have standing to bring an action for declaratory, injunctive, and/or monetary relief to enforce the rights created by this part (a) of subsection (4)(1) on behalf of themselves.  Those actions shall be brought in the circuit court for the county in which a plaintiff resides. If a plaintiff prevails in whole or in part, the court shall award reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and disbursements.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>For purposes of this part (a) of subsection (4)(1), "person" means an individual, association, corporation, joint stock company, labor organization, legal representative, mutual company, partnership, unincorporated organization, the state or a political subdivision of the state or an agency of the state, or any other legal entity, and includes an agent of a person.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The right, if serving in the military or living overseas, to have an absent voter ballot sent to them at least forty-five (45) days before an election upon application and to have their absent voter ballot deemed timely received if postmarked on or before election day and received by the appropriate election official within six (6) days after such election.  For purposes of this part (b) of subsection (4)(1), a postmark shall include any type of mark applied by the United States Postal Service or any delivery service to the return envelope, including but not limited to a bar code or any tracking marks, which indicates when a ballot was mailed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The right, once registered, to a "straight party" vote option on partisan general election ballots. In partisan elections, the ballot shall include a position at the top of the ballot by which the voter may, by a single selection, record a straight party ticket vote for all the candidates of one (1) party. The voter may vote a split or mixed ticket.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The right to be automatically registered to vote as a result of conducting business with the secretary of state regarding a driver's license or personal identification card, unless the person declines such registration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The right to register to vote for an election by mailing a completed voter registration application on or before the fifteenth (15th) day before that election to an election official authorized to receive voter registration applications.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) The right to register to vote for an election by (1) appearing in person and submitting a completed voter registration application on or before the fifteenth (15th) day before that election to an election official authorized to receive voter registration applications, or (2) beginning on the fourteenth (14th) day before that election and continuing through the day of that election, appearing in person, submitting a completed voter registration application and providing proof of residency to an election official responsible for maintaining custody of the registration file where the person resides, or their deputies. Persons registered in accordance with subsection (1)(f) shall be immediately eligible to receive a regular or absent voter ballot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The right, once registered, to prove their identity when voting in person or applying for an absent voter ballot in person by (1) presenting their photo identification, including photo identification issued by a federal, state, local, or tribal government or an educational institution, or (2) if they do not have photo identification or do not have it with them, executing an affidavit verifying their identity. A voter shall not be required to vote a provisional ballot solely because they executed an affidavit to prove their identity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The right, once registered, to vote an absent voter ballot without giving a reason, during the forty (40) days before an election, and the right to choose whether the absent voter ballot is applied for, received and submitted in person or by mail. During that time, election officials authorized to issue absent voter ballots shall be available in at least one (1) location to issue and receive absent voter ballots during the election officials' regularly scheduled business hours and for at least eight (8) hours during the Saturday and/or Sunday immediately prior to the election. Those election officials shall have the authority to make absent voter ballots available for voting in person at additional times and places beyond what is required herein. Voters shall have the right to prove their identity when applying for or voting an absent voter ballot other than in person by providing their signature to the election official authorized to issue absent voter ballots. Those election officials shall: (1) verify the identity of a voter who applies for an absent voter ballot other than in person by comparing the voter's signature on the absent voter ballot application to the voter's signature in their registration record; and (2) verify the identity of a voter who votes an absent voter ballot other than in person by comparing the signature on the absent voter ballot envelope to the signature on the voter's absent voter ballot application or the signature in the voter's registration record.  If those election officials determine from either of the comparisons in (1) or (2) of this part (h) of subsection (4)(1) that the signatures do not sufficiently agree, or if the voter's signature on the absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot envelope is missing, the voter has a right to be notified immediately and afforded due process, including an equitable opportunity to correct the issue with the signature.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The right to: (1) state-funded prepaid postage to return an absent voter ballot application provided to them by a Michigan election official; (2) state-funded prepaid postage to return a voted absent voter ballot; and (3) a state-funded system to track submitted absent voter ballot applications and absent voter ballots. The system shall permit voters to elect to receive electronic notifications regarding the status of the voter's submitted absent voter ballot application and absent voter ballot, inform voters of any deficiency with the voter's submitted absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot, and provide instructions for addressing any such deficiency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) The right to at least one (1) state-funded secure drop-box for every municipality, and for municipalities with more than fifteen thousand (15,000) registered voters at least one (1) drop-box for every fifteen thousand (15,000) registered voters, for the return of completed absent voter ballot applications and voted absent voter ballots.  Secure drop­boxes shall be distributed equitably throughout the municipality and shall be accessible twenty-four (24) hours per day during the forty (40) days prior to any election and until eight (8) pm on election day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) The right, once registered, to have an absent voter ballot sent to the voter before each election by submitting a single signed absent voter ballot application covering all future elections. An election official responsible for issuing absent voter ballots shall issue an absent voter ballot for each election to every voter in the jurisdiction who has exercised the right in this part (k) of subsection (4)(1) and shall not require such voter to submit a separate application for an absent voter ballot for any election. A voter's exercise of this right shall be rescinded only if: (1) the voter submits a signed request to rescind; (2) the voter is no longer qualified to vote; (3) the secretary of state or the election official responsible for issuing the voter an absent voter ballot receives reliable information that the voter has moved to another state, or has moved within this state without updating their voter registration address; or (4) the voter does not vote for six (6) consecutive years. The exercise of the right in this part (k) of subsection (4)(1) shall remain in effect without the need for a new absent voter ballot application when the voter changes their residence in this state and updates their voter registration address.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) The right to have the results of statewide elections audited, in such a manner as prescribed by law, to ensure the accuracy and integrity of elections. The secretary of state shall conduct election audits, and shall supervise and direct county election officials in the conduct of such audits.  No officer or member of the governing body of a national, state, or local political party, and no political party precinct delegate, shall have any role in the direction, supervision, or conduct of an election audit. Public election officials shall maintain the security and custody of all ballots and election materials during an election audit.  Election audits shall be conducted in public based on methods finalized and made public prior to the election to be audited. All funding of election audits shall be publicly disclosed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) The right, once registered, to vote in each statewide and federal election in person at an early voting site prior to election day. Voters at early voting sites shall have the same rights and be subject to the same requirements as voters at polling places on election day. An early voting site is a polling place and shall be subject to the same requirements as an election day polling place, except that an early voting site may serve voters from more than six (6) precincts and may serve voters from more than one (1) municipality within a county. An early voting site shall also be subject to the same requirements as an election day precinct, except that any statutory limit on the number of voters assigned to a precinct shall not apply to an early voting site. Each early voting site shall be open for at least nine (9) consecutive days beginning on the second Saturday before the election and ending on the Sunday before the election, for at least eight (8) hours each day, and may be open for additional days and hours beyond what is required herein at the discretion of the election official authorized to issue ballots in the jurisdiction conducting the election. Jurisdictions conducting elections within a county may enter into agreements to share early voting sites. A jurisdiction conducting an election may enter into an agreement with the clerk of the county in which it is located authorizing the county clerk to conduct early voting for the jurisdiction. Jurisdictions conducting non-statewide elections may offer early voting for such elections in accordance with the provisions of this part (m) of subsection (4)(1). No early voting results shall be generated or reported until after eight (8) pm on election day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>All rights set forth in this subsection shall be self-executing. This subsection shall be liberally construed in favor of voters' rights in order to effectuate its purposes. Nothing contained in this subsection shall prevent the legislature from expanding voters' rights beyond what is provided herein. This subsection and any portion hereof shall be severable. If any portion of this subsection is held invalid or unenforceable as to any person or circumstance, that invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity, enforceability, or application of any other portion of this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as otherwise provided in this constitution or in the constitution or laws of the United States the legislature shall enact laws to regulate the time, place and manner of all nominations and elections, to preserve the purity of elections, to preserve the secrecy of the ballot, to guard against abuses of the elective franchise, and to provide for a system of voter registration and absentee voting. No law shall be enacted which permits a candidate in any partisan primary or partisan election to have a ballot designation except when required for identification of candidates for the same office who have the same or similar surnames.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A county, city, or township conducting an election may accept and use publicly-disclosed charitable donations and in-kind contributions to conduct and administer elections. The county, city, or township shall retain discretion over whether to accept or use any such donations or contributions.  Charitable donations and in-kind contributions of foreign funds or from foreign sources are prohibited.</div>

The power of initiative extends only to laws which the legislature may enact under this constitution. The power of referendum does not extend to acts making appropriations for state institutions or to meet deficiencies in state funds and must be invoked in the manner prescribed by law within 90 days following the final adjournment of the legislative session at which the law was enacted. To invoke the initiative or referendum, petitions signed by a number of registered electors, not less than eight percent for initiative and five percent for referendum of the total vote cast for all candidates for governor at the last preceding general election at which a governor was elected shall be required.</DIV>

Laws approved by the people under the referendum provision of this section may be amended by the legislature at any subsequent session thereof.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vi) Any person who is registered as a lobbyist agent with the Michigan bureau of elections, or any employee of such person; or</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(vii) An unclassified state employee who is exempt from classification in state civil service pursuant to article XI, section 5, except for employees of courts of record, employees of the state institutions of higher education, and persons in the armed forces of the state;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Not be a parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, or spouse of any individual disqualified under part (1)(b) of this section; or</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Not be otherwise disqualified for appointed or elected office by this constitution.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) For five years after the date of appointment, a commissioner is ineligible to hold a partisan elective office at the state, county, city, village, or township level in Michigan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Commissioners shall be selected through the following process:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The secretary of state shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Make applications for commissioner available to the general public not later than January 1 of the year of the federal decennial census. The secretary of state shall circulate the applications in a manner that invites wide public participation from different regions of the state.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Require applicants to provide a completed application.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) Require applicants to attest under oath that they meet the qualifications set forth in this section; and either that they affiliate with one of the two political parties with the largest representation in the legislature (hereinafter, "major parties"), and if so, identify the party with which they affiliate, or that they do not affiliate with either of the major parties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Subject to part (2)(c) of this section, the secretary of state shall mail additional applications for commissioner to Michigan registered voters selected at random until 30 qualifying applicants that affiliate with one of the two major parties have submitted applications, 30 qualifying applicants that identify that they affiliate with the other of the two major parties have submitted applications, and 40 qualifying applicants that identify that they do not affiliate with either of the two major parties have submitted applications, each in response to the mailings.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) By September 1 of the year of the federal decennial census, the secretary of state shall randomly draw the names of four commissioners from each of the two pools of remaining applicants affiliating with a major party, and five commissioners from the pool of remaining non-affiliating applicants.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as provided below, commissioners shall hold office for the term set forth in part (18) of this section. If a commissioner's seat becomes vacant for any reason, the secretary of state shall fill the vacancy by randomly drawing a name from the remaining qualifying applicants in the selection pool from which the original commissioner was selected.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Beginning no later than December 1 of the year preceding the federal decennial census, and continuing each year in which the commission operates, the legislature shall appropriate funds sufficient to compensate the commissioners and to enable the commission to carry out its functions, operations and activities, which activities include retaining independent, nonpartisan subject-matter experts and legal counsel, conducting hearings, publishing notices and maintaining a record of the commission's proceedings, and any other activity necessary for the commission to conduct its business, at an amount equal to not less than 25 percent of the general fund/general purpose budget for the secretary of state for that fiscal year. Within six months after the conclusion of each fiscal year, the commission shall return to the state treasury all moneys unexpended for that fiscal year. The commission shall furnish reports of expenditures, at least annually, to the governor and the legislature and shall be subject to annual audit as provided by law. Each commissioner shall receive compensation at least equal to 25 percent of the governor's salary. The State of Michigan shall indemnify commissioners for costs incurred if the legislature does not appropriate sufficient funds to cover such costs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The commission shall have legal standing to prosecute an action regarding the adequacy of resources provided for the operation of the commission, and to defend any action regarding an adopted plan. The commission shall inform the legislature if the commission determines that funds or other resources provided for operation of the commission are not adequate. The legislature shall provide adequate funding to allow the commission to defend any action regarding an adopted plan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The secretary of state shall issue a call convening the commission by October 15 in the year of the federal decennial census. Not later than November 1 in the year immediately following the federal decennial census, the commission shall adopt a redistricting plan under this section for each of the following types of districts: state senate districts, state house of representative districts, and congressional districts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Before commissioners draft any plan, the commission shall hold at least ten public hearings throughout the state for the purpose of informing the public about the redistricting process and the purpose and responsibilities of the commission and soliciting information from the public about potential plans. The commission shall receive for consideration written submissions of proposed redistricting plans and any supporting materials, including underlying data, from any member of the public. These written submissions are public records.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) After developing at least one proposed redistricting plan for each type of district, the commission shall publish the proposed redistricting plans and any data and supporting materials used to develop the plans. Each commissioner may only propose one redistricting plan for each type of district. The commission shall hold at least five public hearings throughout the state for the purpose of soliciting comment from the public about the proposed plans. Each of the proposed plans shall include such census data as is necessary to accurately describe the plan and verify the population of each district, and a map and legal description that include the political subdivisions, such as counties, cities, and townships; man-made features, such as streets, roads, highways, and railroads; and natural features, such as waterways, which form the boundaries of the districts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Each commissioner shall perform his or her duties in a manner that is impartial and reinforces public confidence in the integrity of the redistricting process. The commission shall conduct all of its business at open meetings. Nine commissioners, including at least one commissioner from each selection pool shall constitute a quorum, and all meetings shall require a quorum. The commission shall provide advance public notice of its meetings and hearings. The commission shall conduct its hearings in a manner that invites wide public participation throughout the state. The commission shall use technology to provide contemporaneous public observation and meaningful public participation in the redistricting process during all meetings and hearings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The commission, its members, staff, attorneys, and consultants shall not discuss redistricting matters with members of the public outside of an open meeting of the commission, except that a commissioner may communicate about redistricting matters with members of the public to gain information relevant to the performance of his or her duties if such communication occurs (a) in writing or (b) at a previously publicly noticed forum or town hall open to the general public. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>The commission, its members, staff, attorneys, experts, and consultants may not directly or indirectly solicit or accept any gift or loan of money, goods, services, or other thing of value greater than $20 for the benefit of any person or organization, which may influence the manner in which the commissioner, staff, attorney, expert, or consultant performs his or her duties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Except as provided in part (14) of this section, a final decision of the commission requires the concurrence of a majority of the commissioners. A decision on the dismissal or retention of paid staff or consultants requires the vote of at least one commissioner affiliating with each of the major parties and one non-affiliating commissioner. All decisions of the commission shall be recorded, and the record of its decisions shall be readily available to any member of the public without charge.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The commission shall abide by the following criteria in proposing and adopting each plan, in order of priority:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Districts shall be of equal population as mandated by the United States constitution, and shall comply with the voting rights act and other federal laws.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Districts shall be geographically contiguous. Island areas are considered to be contiguous by land to the county of which they are a part.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Districts shall reflect the state's diverse population and communities of interest. Communities of interest may include, but shall not be limited to, populations that share cultural or historical characteristics or economic interests. Communities of interest do not include relationships with political parties, incumbents, or political candidates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Districts shall not provide a disproportionate advantage to any political party. A disproportionate advantage to a political party shall be determined using accepted measures of partisan fairness.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Districts shall not favor or disfavor an incumbent elected official or a candidate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Districts shall reflect consideration of county, city, and township boundaries.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Districts shall be reasonably compact.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) The commission shall follow the following procedure in adopting a plan:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Before voting to adopt a plan, the commission shall ensure that the plan is tested, using appropriate technology, for compliance with the criteria described above.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Before voting to adopt a plan, the commission shall provide public notice of each plan that will be voted on and provide at least 45 days for public comment on the proposed plan or plans. Each plan that will be voted on shall include such census data as is necessary to accurately describe the plan and verify the population of each district, and shall include the map and legal description required in part (9) of this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A final decision of the commission to adopt a redistricting plan requires a majority vote of the commission, including at least two commissioners who affiliate with each major party, and at least two commissioners who do not affiliate with either major party. If no plan satisfies this requirement for a type of district, the commission shall use the following procedure to adopt a plan for that type of district:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Each commissioner may submit one proposed plan for each type of district to the full commission for consideration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Each commissioner shall rank the plans submitted according to preference. Each plan shall be assigned a point value inverse to its ranking among the number of choices, giving the lowest ranked plan one point and the highest ranked plan a point value equal to the number of plans submitted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The commission shall adopt the plan receiving the highest total points, that is also ranked among the top half of plans by at least two commissioners not affiliated with the party of the commissioner submitting the plan, or in the case of a plan submitted by non-affiliated commissioners, is ranked among the top half of plans by at least two commissioners affiliated with a major party. If plans are tied for the highest point total, the secretary of state shall randomly select the final plan from those plans. If no plan meets the requirements of this subparagraph, the secretary of state shall randomly select the final plan from among all submitted plans pursuant to part (14)(c)(i).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) Within 30 days after adopting a plan, the commission shall publish the plan and the material reports, reference materials, and data used in drawing it, including any programming information used to produce and test the plan. The published materials shall be such that an independent person is able to replicate the conclusion without any modification of any of the published materials.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) For each adopted plan, the commission shall issue a report that explains the basis on which the commission made its decisions in achieving compliance with plan requirements and shall include the map and legal description required in part (9) of this section. A commissioner who votes against a redistricting plan may submit a dissenting report which shall be issued with the commission's report.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) An adopted redistricting plan shall become law 60 days after its publication. The secretary of state shall keep a public record of all proceedings of the commission and shall publish and distribute each plan and required documentation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) The terms of the commissioners shall expire once the commission has completed its obligations for a census cycle but not before any judicial review of the redistricting plan is complete.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) The supreme court, in the exercise of original jurisdiction, shall direct the secretary of state or the commission to perform their respective duties, may review a challenge to any plan adopted by the commission, and shall remand a plan to the commission for further action if the plan fails to comply with the requirements of this constitution, the constitution of the United States or superseding federal law. In no event shall any body, except the independent citizens redistricting commission acting pursuant to this section, promulgate and adopt a redistricting plan or plans for this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) This section is self-executing. If a final court decision holds any part or parts of this section to be in conflict with the United States constitution or federal law, the section shall be implemented to the maximum extent that the United States constitution and federal law permit. Any provision held invalid is severable from the remaining portions of this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(21) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no employer shall discharge, threaten to discharge, intimidate, coerce, or retaliate against any employee because of the employee's membership on the commission or attendance or scheduled attendance at any meeting of the commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(22) Notwithstanding any other provision of this constitution, or any prior judicial decision, as of the effective date of the constitutional amendment adding this provision, which amends article IV, sections 1 through 6, article V, sections 1, 2 and 4, and article VI, sections 1 and 4, including this provision, for purposes of interpreting this constitutional amendment the people declare that the powers granted to the commission are legislative functions not subject to the control or approval of the legislature, and are exclusively reserved to the commission. The commission, and all of its responsibilities, operations, functions, contractors, consultants and employees are not subject to change, transfer, reorganization, or reassignment, and shall not be altered or abrogated in any manner whatsoever, by the legislature. No other body shall be established by law to perform functions that are the same or similar to those granted to the commission in this section.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The state, in addition to any other borrowing power, may borrow from time to time such amounts as shall be required, pledge its faith and credit and issue its notes or bonds therefor, for the purpose of making loans to school districts as provided in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If the minimum amount which would otherwise be necessary for a school district to levy in any year to pay principal and interest on its qualified bonds, including any necessary allowances for estimated tax delinquencies, exceeds 13 mills on each dollar of its assessed valuation as finally equalized, or such lower millage as the legislature may prescribe, then the school district may elect to borrow all or any part of the excess from the state. In that event the state shall lend the excess amount to the school district for the payment of principal and interest. If for any reason any school district will be or is unable to pay the principal and interest on its qualified bonds when due, then the school district shall borrow and the state shall lend to it an amount sufficient to enable the school district to make the payment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The term "qualified bonds" means general obligation bonds of school districts issued for capital expenditures, including refunding bonds, issued prior to May 4, 1955, or issued thereafter and qualified as provided by law pursuant to Section 27 or Section 28 of Article X of the Constitution of 1908 or pursuant to this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   After a school district has received loans from the state, each year thereafter it shall levy for debt service, exclusive of levies for nonqualified bonds, not less than 13 mills or such lower millage as the legislature may prescribe, until the amount loaned has been repaid, and any tax collections therefrom in any year over and above the minimum requirements for principal and interest on qualified bonds shall be used toward the repayment of state loans. In any year when such levy would produce an amount in excess of the requirements and the amount due to the state, the levy may be reduced by the amount of the excess.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Subject to the foregoing provisions, the legislature shall have the power to prescribe and to limit the procedure, terms and conditions for the qualification of bonds, for obtaining and making state loans, and for the repayment of loans.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The power to tax for the payment of principal and interest on bonds hereafter issued which are the general obligations of any school district, including refunding bonds, and for repayment of any state loans made to school districts, shall be without limitation as to rate or amount.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   All rights acquired under Sections 27 and 28 of Article X of the Constitution of 1908, by holders of bonds heretofore issued, and all obligations assumed by the state or any school district under these sections, shall remain unimpaired.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 26.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   There is hereby established a limit on the total amount of taxes which may be imposed by the legislature in any fiscal year on the taxpayers of this state. This limit shall not be changed without approval of the majority of the qualified electors voting thereon, as provided for in Article 12 of the Constitution. Effective with fiscal year 1979-1980, and for each fiscal year thereafter, the legislature shall not impose taxes of any kind which, together with all other revenues of the state, federal aid excluded, exceed the revenue limit established in this section. The revenue limit shall be equal to the product of the ratio of Total State Revenues in fiscal year 1978-79 divided by the Personal Income of Michigan in calendar year 1977 multiplied by the Personal Income of Michigan in either the prior calendar year or the average of Personal Income of Michigan in the previous three calendar years, whichever is greater.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   For any fiscal year in the event that Total State Revenues exceed the revenue limit established in this section by 1% or more, the excess revenues shall be refunded pro rata based on the liability reported on the Michigan income tax and single business tax (or its successor tax or taxes) annual returns filed following the close of such fiscal year. If the excess is less than 1%, this excess may be transferred to the State Budget Stabilization Fund.</DIV>
