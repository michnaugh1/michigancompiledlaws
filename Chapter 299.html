  <p><BR><B>History:</B> 1991, E.R.O. No. 1991-22, Eff. Jan. 16, 1992 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> In House Speaker v Governor, 195 Mich App 376; 491 NW2d 832 (1992), the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court decision finding Executive Order No. 1991-31 to be a violation of the Separation of Powers Clause and the Executive Organization Act. The Michigan Supreme Court, 443 Mich 560; 506 NW2d 190 (1993), unanimously reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court held that (1) the not-for-profit corporate plaintiffs had standing to sue under MCR 2.201(B)(4); (2) the issues presented were justiciable political questions; (3) E.O. 1991-31 was a constitutional expression of the governor's authority; and (4) E.O. 1992-19 did not wrongfully delegate rule-making authority to the Environmental Science Board.<BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> House Concurrent Resolution No. 487, a resolution to disapprove Executive Order No. 1991-31 (E.R.O. 1991-22) pertaining to the reorganization of the department of natural resources, was adopted by the House of Representatives on November 21, 1991, and referred to the Senate Committee on Government Operations. A motion to discharge the Committee on Government Operations from further consideration of House Concurrent Resolution No. 487 did not prevail on a vote of 14-20 recorded December 4, 1991.For transfer of powers and duties of department of natural resources and environment to department of natural resources, see E.R.O. No. 2011-1, compiled at MCL 324.99921.</p>
