The term of office of a commissioner shall begin on the January 1 following the drain commissioner's election and continue for a period of 4 years and until his or her successor is elected and qualified, whichever occurs earlier. If a drain commissioner is unable to execute the duties of his or her office and a deputy commissioner has not been appointed under section 24, the county clerk and prosecuting attorney of that county may appoint a temporary replacement to hold the office until the commissioner is able to return to his or her duties or until the expiration of the commissioner's term of office. The temporary replacement shall perform the same duties, have the same responsibilities, and receive the same compensation as the drain commissioner. The appointment shall be made in writing and filed with the clerk of the county. If a vacancy in the office of drain commissioner arises while an individual is serving as temporary drain commissioner, the temporary drain commissioner shall have all the powers and duties of a drain commissioner until a drain commissioner is elected or appointed. As determined by the county board of commissioners, a temporary drain commissioner shall be covered by a blanket bond or shall file a bond with the county clerk in a sum not less than $100,000.00, conditioned upon the faithful discharge of his or her duties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) As determined by the county board of commissioners, the county drain commissioner shall be covered by a blanket bond or before entering upon the duties of office, shall execute and file with the county clerk a bond to the people of the state in the penal sum of $100,000.00, issued by a surety company licensed to do business in this state, conditioned upon the faithful discharge of the duties of the office. The county board of commissioners may fix the individual bond to be required of the commissioner at a different amount if, in its judgment, that is desirable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The county board of commissioners of a county having a population of less than 12,000, by resolution of a 2/3 vote of the members elect, may abolish the office of county drain commissioner and transfer the powers and duties of the office to the board of county road commissioners.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a county establishes a department of public works pursuant to 1957 PA 185, MCL 123.731 to 123.786, or a public improvement agency with the drain commissioner designated as the county agent pursuant to the county public improvement act of 1939, 1939 PA 342, MCL 46.171 to 46.188, the county board of commissioners, by resolution of a 2/3 vote of the members elected and serving, may combine the powers, duties, and functions set forth in 1957 PA 185, MCL 123.731 to 123.786, the county public improvement act of 1939, 1939 PA 342, MCL 46.171 to 46.188, and this act into 1 county department headed by a public works commissioner. The public works commissioner shall be elected in the same manner and for the same term as a drain commissioner and shall carry out the powers and duties of a drain commissioner.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Not less than 3 years after a county establishes the office of public works commissioner pursuant to subsections (4) and (5), or a public improvement agency, the county board of commissioners, by resolution approved by a 2/3 vote of the members elected and serving, may abolish the office of public works commissioner not less than 6 months before the next primary election for that office. The office of public works commissioner shall be abolished in the county effective 180 days after a resolution is adopted pursuant to this subsection. The office shall then be referred to as the drain commissioner and the person in office at the time a resolution of abolishment is passed shall fulfill the remainder of the term of office until the next general election.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A county that is organized under 1966 PA 293, MCL 45.501 to 45.521, whose charter prescribes an elected county executive, and which county has a population of more than 2,000,000 at the time the charter is adopted, shall be governed by section 21a in place of this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Except for a county subject to subsection (7), if a drain commissioner performs functions other than acting as a drain commissioner under this act, including, but not limited to, operating sewers, lake level and soil erosion enforcement, and facilitating compliance with federal clean water act mandates, a county may, by resolution of the majority of the members elected and serving on the board of commissioners and with the consent of the drain commissioner, change the name of the office of the drain commissioner to the office of the water resources commissioner. The water resources commissioner shall be elected in the same manner as a drain commissioner and carry out the powers and duties of a drain commissioner as provided in this act.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 51.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Before a commissioner takes any action on any application to locate, establish and construct any drain, there shall first be filed with him an application to lay out and designate a drainage district with reference to a proposed drain therein; such application shall tentatively describe the location and route of such proposed drain. The application shall be signed by not less than 10 freeholders of the township or townships in which such proposed drain or the proposed lands to be drained thereby may be situated: Provided, That 5 or more of said signers shall be the owners of land liable to an assessment for the construction of such proposed drain: Provided further, If it shall appear to the drain commissioner on filing an application to lay out and designate a drainage district that said district might not include 20 freeholders whose lands would be liable for such assessment, in such case such application shall be received if any one of the signers is a freeholder liable to an assessment for the construction of such proposed drain. The eligibility of the signers to such application shall be determined by the drain commissioner according to their interest of record in the office of the register of deeds, in the probate court or in the circuit court of the county in which such lands are situated at the time such application is filed. The board of supervisors, by resolution, may instruct the drain commissioner to refuse any application to lay out a drainage district unless a cash deposit, sufficient to cover the preliminary costs, accompanies the application. If the drain is completed, the cost advanced shall be returned to the depositor or his personal representative out of the first tax collections on the drain. If uncompleted, any excess above costs shall be so returned. In lieu of an application signed by freeholders as aforesaid, such an application may be signed solely by the board of health of the county if the proposed drain is necessary for the public health of any part of the county, or may be signed solely by any city, village or township when duly authorized by its governing body, if the proposed drain is necessary for the public health of such municipality and if such municipality will be liable for an assessment at large against it for a percentage of the cost of the proposed drain. The entry of an order designating a drainage district, as hereinafter provided, shall be deemed a determination of the sufficiency of such application.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 52.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upon filing of such application for a new drainage district, the commissioner shall immediately cause a survey to be made by a competent surveyor or engineer to determine the area which would be drained by the proposed drain, and the route and type of construction of the drain or drains most serviceable for that purpose. He shall not be limited in such determination to the route described in the application. In any county having a board of county auditors, no survey shall be ordered without the approval of such board but if the application shows, or it is determined thereafter, that any such proposed drainage district will affect lands in more than 1 county, the commissioner shall proceed under the portions of chapter 5 of this act relating to intercounty drains, and in such case the approval of the board of county auditors shall not be required. If upon the survey, or if before the survey is made, the commissioner determines that the proposed drain is impractical, he shall take no further action thereon but shall, in writing, notify the persons who delivered the application to him, of that fact, and his reasons for making his determination. If upon the survey the commissioner determines the proposed drain to be practical, he shall lay out a drainage district, prepare and file in the office of the drain commissioner a description of the drainage district, which may be described by its boundaries of highways and streets and tracts and parcels of land including therein all highways and streets, townships, cities and villages or by a description of all tracts or parcels of land, highways, townships, cities and villages which would be benefited by the construction of the proposed drain, and which would be liable to an assessment therefor, should the drain be constructed as hereinafter provided. The commissioner shall obtain from the county treasurer a statement showing as near as may be the amount of taxes and special assessments levied against the lands in the proposed drainage district on the tax rolls for the 3 years next preceding, and the amount of such taxes and assessments remaining unpaid, and if it appears from the statement that 33 1/3% or more of the lands in the proposed drainage district have been returned as tax delinquent and still remain delinquent, no further action shall be taken.</DIV>

In lieu of a petition signed by freeholders as aforesaid, the petition may be signed solely by a city, village or township when duly authorized by its governing body, or by any combination of such municipalities, if such petitioning municipality or municipalities will be liable to assessments at large for at least a percentage of the total amount to be assessed for the cost of the proposed drain.

If the commissioner is disqualified or chooses not to appoint the board of determination, the commissioner shall immediately file a copy of the petition with the chairperson of the county board of commissioners, together with a statement, signed by the commissioner, that he or she is disqualified or chooses not to act in appointing a board of determination. As soon as practicable after receiving a copy of the petition and certificate, the chairperson of the county board of commissioners, unless he or she has a conflict of interest, shall appoint a board of determination composed of 3 disinterested property owners and shall immediately notify the drain commissioner of the names and addresses of those appointed.

The commissioner shall also give such notice, not less than 10 days before the meeting, by all of the following means:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Service on the county clerk and a member of the board of county road commissioners of the county and on the supervisor of each township and clerk of each city and village in the drainage district, personally or by certified mail. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Service by first-class mail on each person whose name appears on the last city, village, or township tax roll as owning land within the drainage district, at the address shown on the roll. If an address does not appear on the roll, a notice need not be mailed to the person. The drain commissioner shall make an affidavit of the mailing and shall recite in the affidavit that the notice was mailed to all of the persons whose names and addresses appear upon the tax rolls as owning land within the drainage district. The affidavit is conclusive proof that notice was mailed to each person to whom notice is required to be mailed under this section.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) At the time and place specified in the notice, the board of determination shall meet, elect a chairperson and secretary, and, after considering the evidence offered, determine the necessity of the proposed drain and whether the drain is conducive to public health, convenience, or welfare. The board of determination, if it considers it necessary, shall require the county drain commissioner to obtain from the county treasurer a statement showing the amount of taxes and special assessments levied against the land in the proposed drainage district on the tax rolls for the immediately preceding 3 years and the amount of the taxes and assessments remaining unpaid. If it appears from the statement that 25% or more of the taxes are unpaid on the lands, further action shall not be taken. If the board of determination finds, by a majority vote of the members, that the drain is not necessary and conducive to public health, convenience, or welfare, the board of determination shall file with the commissioner an order dismissing the petition, and a further petition for the drain shall not be filed within 1 year after the determination. If the board of determination finds, by a majority vote, that the proposed drain is necessary and conducive to the public health, convenience, or welfare, the board of determination shall make an order to that effect and file the order with the commissioner. Not more than 10 days after the board of determination files an order finding the proposed drain to be necessary and conducive to the public health, convenience, or welfare, the drain commissioner shall determine the cities, townships, and villages within the drainage district benefiting from the drain for public health and shall notify each such city, township, and village that it is liable to pay a percent of the cost of construction of the drain by reason of benefits at large for public health. Within 20 days after the commissioner's receipt of the order of the board of determination, if an appeal has not been taken under section 72a, the drain commissioner shall make a first order of determination in writing, giving the name or number of the drainage district and a general description of the route, terminus, and type of construction of the drain.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Before any action is taken on a petition to locate, establish, and construct a drain that will traverse lands in more than 1 county, or affect more than 1 county, an application must be filed with a commissioner having jurisdiction of any of the lands to lay out and designate a drainage district. The application shall tentatively describe the location and route of the proposed drain. Except as provided in subsection (2), the application shall be signed by ten or more freeholders of the cities, villages, or townships in which the proposed drain or the lands proposed to be benefitted by the drain are located. Five or more of the signers shall be the freeholders whose lands will be liable for an assessment for the construction of the proposed drain. However, if it appears to the drain commissioner to whom the application is submitted that the drainage district may not include at least 20 freeholders whose lands will be liable for an assessment, the application shall be received if at least 1 of the signers is a freeholder whose land will be liable for an assessment. The eligibility of the signers to the application shall be determined by their interest of record in the office of the register of deeds, in the probate court, or in the circuit court of the county in which the lands are located at the time the application is filed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An application under subsection (1) need only be signed by a representative of a city, village, or township who is authorized by its governing body, if both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The proposed drain is necessary for the public health of the city, village, or township.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The city, village, or township will be liable for an assessment at large for a percentage of the cost of the proposed drain.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If the drain commissioner of a county involved considers the apportionment between the counties to be unfair, the commissioner shall have the right to have the apportionment reviewed by an arbitration board to be composed of drain commissioners from unaffected counties in this state. Within 20 days after the order of apportionment provided in section 105, the commissioner shall file with the department of agriculture a claim for review by arbitration in which the commissioner shall state briefly in what respect he or she considers the apportionment unfair and request, over the commissioner's official signature, a review by arbitration. The commissioner shall nominate a disinterested drain commissioner as his or her choice for the arbitration board. Upon receipt of the claim for review by arbitration, the director of the department of agriculture or the director's deputy shall forward to each county drain commissioner involved, except the claimant, within 10 days, a copy of the claim for review by arbitration. The commissioners, within 10 days, shall notify the department of agriculture of their selection to the arbitration board. The director of the department of agriculture, at the earliest date, consistent with Act No. 267 of the Public Acts of 1976, but not later than 30 days after the notice, shall notify the chosen drain commissioners of a date and time they shall meet in the commissioner's office in Lansing. At the meeting they shall select 1 or 2 more unaffected drain commissioners in the state to complete the board of review.

Upon selection of the final members of the board of review, those members present shall set a date, time, and place in an affected county for a first full meeting of the board of review. Notice of the meeting shall be posted in 5 public places in each county affected and be served personally or by registered mail at least 10 days before the meeting on the county clerk of the county and the supervisor of a township in each county traversed by the drain. A notice of the meeting shall be published once a week for 2 consecutive weeks before the meeting in a newspaper published and of general circulation in the counties affected. The first publication is to be at least 10 days before the meeting. The director of the department of agriculture shall notify the 1 or 2 drain commissioners selected of their appointment and of the date, time, and place of the next meeting of the full board. The board of arbitration shall convene at the time, date, and place specified, elect a chairperson and secretary, and review the fairness of the apportionment between the counties. The board may adjourn until their review is completed.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) After an intercounty drainage district has been established and the order establishing the intercounty drainage district has been filed as provided in this act, a petition to locate, establish, and construct a drain may be filed with any commissioner having jurisdiction of any of the lands designated in the order as constituting the drainage district. The petition shall ask for the location, establishment, and construction of the drain or drains, or any part of the drain or drains, as described in the order. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to subsection (3), the petition under subsection (1) shall be signed by a number of freeholders in the drainage district, whose lands would be liable to an assessment for benefits, equal to 1/2 of the number of freeholders whose lands would be traversed by the drain or drains applied for, or abut on the part of any highway or street along the side of which the drain extends, between the point where the drain enters the highway and the point where it leaves the highway and which lands are within the drainage district. The petition shall be accompanied by a description of the land in the district owned by each signer and by a certificate of the county treasurer as to payment of taxes and special assessments against the lands. The certificate shall be in substantially the following form:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>I hereby certify that there are no taxes or special assessments unpaid against any of the lands described in the annexed list according to the records of the county treasurer's office for the past 3 years, except as follows:
<B></B><table>
    <tr>
      <td>Description</td>
      <td>Year</td>
      <td>Tax or assessment</td>
      <td>Amount</td>
    </tr>

      <td>.............</td>
      <td>...........</td>
      <td>......................</td>
      <td>.........</td>
    </tr>
  </table><B></B>(3) For purposes of determining the number of freeholders needed for a petition under subsection (2), the name of any signer as to whose land the certificate under subsection (2) shows taxes or special assessments unpaid for 3 years shall not be counted. The eligibility of the signers to the petition shall be determined by their interest of record in the office of the register of deeds, in the probate court, or in the circuit court of the counties in which the lands are situated at the time the petition is filed. In determining the number of owners whose lands are traversed by the drain, or abut the drain, the drain commissioner shall investigate the records of the register of deeds, of the probate court, and of the circuit court of the county, and shall make diligent inquiry in the community, including inquiry of anyone in possession of all of the lands traversed by the drain or abutting the drain, as to the ownership of the lands. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In lieu of a petition signed by freeholders under subsection (2), the petition may be signed solely by a municipality, if authorized by its governing body, or by any combination of such municipalities, if each petitioning municipality will be liable to assessment at large for public health for any part of the cost of the proposed drain. A petition signed under this subsection is not subject to subsection (2) or (3).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) As used in this section, "municipality" means a city, village, or township.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Within 20 days after a petition to locate, establish, and construct an intercounty drain is filed under section 121, the drain commissioner shall notify by certified mail the drain commissioner for each county in which any part of the drainage district is located and the director of the department of agriculture and rural development. The chairperson shall call a meeting of the drainage board within the time set forth in section 102. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The drainage board has the same powers and duties as a drain commissioner with respect to a county drain, except as otherwise provided in this act. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Not less than 10 days before the meeting, the drainage board shall give notice of the time, date, and place of the meeting by all of the following means:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the drainage district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Service, personally or by certified mail, on the county clerk and a member of the board of county road commissioners of each county and the supervisor of each township and clerk of each city and village in the drainage district. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Service, by first-class mail on each person whose name appears on the last city or township tax roll as owning land in the drainage district, at the address shown on the roll.

The drain commissioner shall make an affidavit of the mailing and shall recite in the affidavit that the notice was mailed to all of the persons whose names and addresses appear upon the tax rolls as owning land in the drainage district. The affidavit is conclusive proof that notice was mailed to each person to whom notice is required to be mailed under this subdivision. The failure to receive a notice by mail is not a jurisdictional defect invalidating a drain proceeding or drain assessment if notice was sent by first class mail as provided in this section. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) All expenses of notification shall be paid by the drainage district when created. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The drainage board shall act as the board of determination and shall determine by majority vote the necessity of drains proposed to be located, established, and constructed under this chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The drainage board shall consider the petition and evidence offered, and if it is determined that the drain is necessary for the public health, convenience, or welfare, it shall make an order to that effect and file the order with the drainage board. If the drainage board determines that the drain is not necessary and conducive to the public health, convenience, or welfare, the drainage board shall file an order dismissing the petition, and further petition for the drain shall not be filed within 1 year after the determination. Not more than 10 days after the drainage board files an order finding the proposed drain is necessary and conducive to the public health, convenience, or welfare, the drainage board shall determine the cities, townships, and villages within the drainage district benefiting from the drain for public health and shall notify each such city, village, and township that is liable to pay a percentage of the cost of the construction of the drain by reason of benefits at large for public health. Within 20 days after an order determining that the drain is necessary is filed, if an appeal has not been taken under section 122a, the drainage board shall make a further order, signed by the chairperson, to be known as the first order of determination. The first order of determination shall give the name or number of the drainage district and a general description of the route, terminus, and type of construction of the drain. A copy of the order shall be filed in the office of the county drain commissioner of each county into which any part of the drainage district is located.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a member of the drainage board would be disqualified under sections 381 and 383 from making an apportionment of benefits, both of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The disqualified drainage board member shall not participate in the determination of necessity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A special commissioner shall be appointed pursuant to section 382 to serve as a member of the drainage board to determine necessity.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upon the release of the right of way and damages, or upon the determination and return of the special commissioners, the commissioner shall make his final order of determination establishing the drain, which drain shall be divided into convenient sections for the letting of contracts: Provided, That the commissioner may let the drain in sections or as a whole. Said order of determination shall be filed with the county drain commissioner within 5 days after such order is made. He shall, before the day of letting and review, fix the number of installments for the collection of drainage taxes and apportion the per cent of the cost of construction of such drain which any township, city or village traversed or benefited thereby shall be liable to pay by reason of the benefit to the public health, convenience or welfare, or as the means of improving any highway under the control of such township, city or village. He shall apportion the per cent of the cost of construction of such drain which any highway then under the control of the county or district road commissioners, shall be liable to pay by reason of benefits therefor, and as the means of improving such highway. He shall also apportion the per cent of the cost of construction of such drain which any state trunk line highway, under the control of the state highway commissioner, shall be liable to pay by reason of benefits therefor and as the means of improving said highway. He shall also apportion the per cent of benefits to accrue to any piece or parcel of land by reason of the construction of such drain over and above the per cent apportioned to any township, city or village at large or to any highway as above provided.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The drain commissioner shall advertise for the receipt of bids for the construction of a drain at a specified time, date, and location. If the drain commissioner directly or indirectly maintains an official internet presence, the drain commissioner shall post the advertisement for the receipt of bids on a portion of the website that is fully accessible to the public at least 10 days before, and shall maintain the posting through, the date set for the receipt of bids. If the drain commissioner does not maintain an official internet presence, the advertisement shall be so posted and maintained on the county website.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The commissioner shall give notice, as described in this section, of a public meeting to review the apportionment of benefits. The meeting shall be not less than 5 or more than 30 days after the date set for receiving bids.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The notice under subsection (2) shall be given by publication in a newspaper published and of general circulation in the county at least 10 days before the date of the review of the apportionment.</div>

Notice need not be mailed to a person whose address does not appear on the roll. The drain commissioner shall make an affidavit of the mailing and shall recite in the affidavit that the notice was mailed to all persons whose names and addresses appear on the tax rolls as owning land within the drainage district. The affidavit is conclusive proof that notice was mailed to each person to whom notice is required to be mailed. If notice has been sent by first-class mail as provided in this subsection, the failure to receive notice by mail does not constitute a jurisdictional defect invalidating a drain proceeding or assessment. If the drain commissioner determines that the drain is necessary for the public health and that the whole cost of the drain, except that part which may be apportioned for benefits to highways, shall be apportioned to municipalities, then mailing of individual notices to persons owning land within the drainage district as provided in this subsection is not required.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) At least 10 days before the date of the review of the apportionment, the drain commissioner shall serve the notice under subsection (2) personally or by certified mail on the county clerk and a member of the board of county road commissioners of the county and on the supervisor of each township and clerk of each city or village to be assessed at large.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A statement that comments on the apportionment of benefits may be submitted to the drain commissioner in writing before the date of the meeting to review the apportionment or may be submitted in writing or orally at the review. The statement shall specify the drain commissioner's postal mailing address and electronic mail address and indicate that comments submitted in advance must be received by the drain commissioner before the date of the meeting to ensure consideration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The date, time, and place of the meeting to review the apportionment of benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A statement that, at the meeting to review the apportionment of benefits, the drain commissioner will have available to review the tentative apportionments against parcels and municipalities within the drainage district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) For notice mailed to a person under subsection (4), the estimated percentage and dollar amount apportioned to that person's land, the estimated annual dollar amount apportioned to that person's land, and the estimated project assessment duration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A statement that drain assessments against land will be collected in the same manner as property taxes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A statement that if drain assessments against land are collected by installment, the land owner may pay the assessments in full with any interest to date at any time and thereby avoid further interest charges.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The name of each county, township, city, or village to be assessed at large.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The name or number of the drain.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The address of a website, as provided for in subsection (7), and a statement that the following additional information can be found at that address:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A description of the land constituting the drainage district for the drain. The description may be given by providing a map of the drainage district, by designating the boundaries of the drainage district by streets, highways, parcels, or tracts of land, or by describing the tracts or parcels of land constituting the district. If a parcel or tract is partially located within the district, for the purposes of the notice description only, the drain commissioner may consider the entire parcel or tract to be located in the district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) The number and length of sections, the average depth and width of each section, and if the drain will be a closed drain, the amount and specifications of all tile or pipe required.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) The location, number, type, and size of all culverts and bridges. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) The conditions upon which the contract will be awarded.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If the drain commissioner directly or indirectly maintains an official internet presence, the drain commissioner shall post the information described in subsection (6)(a) to (c) and (e) to (h) on a portion of the website that is fully accessible to the public and shall maintain the posting through the date of the meeting to review the apportionment of benefits. If the drain commissioner does not maintain an official internet presence, the information shall be so posted and maintained on the county website.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Notwithstanding the information provided in the notice under subsection (6)(d), the drain commissioner may subsequently make adjustments to any of the following that the commissioner or drainage board considers necessary, without further notice or an additional meeting to review the apportionment of benefits:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The estimated apportionment percentage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The estimated annual project assessment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The estimated project assessment duration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Bids for the construction of the drain shall be received and the total cost of the drain shall be computed before the time set for review of the apportionment. The computation shall be open to inspection. If the computation is not completed before the review of the apportionment, the drain commissioner shall adjourn the review from time to time, not more than 20 days in all, for the completion of the computation, or shall call a new meeting to review the apportionment of benefits and give notice as provided in subsections (3) to (7). If the contracts on which the computation was based are not executed and new contracts are let at a higher price, the drain commissioner shall correct the computation and, after giving notice as provided in subsections (3) to (7), hold a new review of the apportionment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) At the date, time, and place specified in the notice, or at another date, time, and place to which the county drain commissioner may adjourn the meeting, the apportionment of benefits shall be subject to review for at least 1 day. The review shall be held open from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. At the review, the county clerk or the county road commission may appear on behalf of the county, the supervisor of a township may appear on behalf of a township, the mayor or an officer of the city designated by the mayor may appear on behalf of a city, and the president may appear on behalf of a village. At the review the county drain commissioner shall consider the proofs and allegations and shall do both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Carefully reconsider and review the apportionment of benefits. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Define and equalize the apportionment as is just and equitable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If an apportionment of benefits is made against a state trunk line highway, unless the director of the state transportation department consents in writing to the apportionment, the drain commissioner shall notify by certified mail the director of the state transportation department of the percentage apportioned against the highway and the date, time, and place for a review of apportionment of benefits by the drain commissioner under subsection (2). The notice shall be mailed at least 20 days before the review of the apportionment. If the director of the state transportation department instead desires to have the apportionment of benefits reviewed by the director of the department of agriculture and rural development, the director of the state transportation department, within 10 days after receiving the notice under this subsection, shall file with the drain commissioner an objection to the apportionment. The drain commissioner shall notify the director of the department of agriculture and rural development of the date, time, and place for the review of apportionments. At the meeting, the director of the department of agriculture and rural development, or a deputy of the director, shall review the apportionment made against the state trunk line highway and listen to the proofs and allegations of the parties, and may view the highway benefited. The written decision on the apportionment under this subsection is final.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) An annual inspection may be made of a drain established under this act. An inspection shall be made upon the request of the governing body of a public corporation, as described in section 461, served in whole or in part by the drain to be inspected. Any inspection under this subsection shall be conducted by the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For a county drain, by the drain commissioner or a competent person appointed by the drain commissioner. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For an intercounty drain, by the drainage board or a competent person appointed by the drainage board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Surplus construction funds remaining after completion of construction of a drain, or funds remaining after completion of work performed under a petition for maintenance or improvements under this chapter, shall be deposited in the drain fund of the drainage district and shall be expended for inspection, repair, and maintenance of the drain.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If at any time the drain fund of a drainage district contains less than $5,000.00 per mile or fraction of a mile of a drain, the drain commissioner or drainage board may assess the drainage district for an amount not to exceed $2,500.00 per mile or fraction of a mile in any 1 year. The amount collected under an assessment shall be deposited in the drain fund of the drainage district for inspection, repair, and maintenance of the drain.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If an inspection discloses the necessity of expending money for the maintenance or repair of a drain to keep it in working order, the drain commissioner for a county drain, or the drainage board for an intercounty drain, may without petition expend an amount not to exceed in any 1 year $5,000.00 per mile or fraction of a mile for maintenance and repair of the drain, not including inspection and engineering fees, legal fees, and the cost of publication and mailing. The determination of the maximum expenditure allowed under this subsection shall be based on the total number of miles of the drain and not on the actual number of miles or location of the maintenance or repair. Costs incurred for the inspection, maintenance, and repair of a drain performed under this section may be financed and assessed under this act for not more than 10 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the drain commissioner or the drainage board finds it necessary to expend funds in addition to the amount established in subsection (4) per mile or fraction of a mile in any 1 year for the maintenance and repair of a drain, the additional amounts shall not be expended until approved by resolution of the governing body of each township, city, and village affected by more than 20% of the cost.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the drain fund of a drainage district does not contain sufficient funds to pay for inspection, repair, and maintenance authorized by this section, the drain commissioner or the drainage board may finance the costs for not more than 10 years and shall assess the drainage district for not more than 10 years for the inspection, repair, and maintenance according to benefits received. The first installment of an assessment under this subsection shall be made and spread upon the city or township tax assessment roll within 2 years after the completion of the inspection, repair, and maintenance. If the total expenditure is more than the amount established in subsection (4) per mile or fraction of a mile, all real property owners subject to an assessment within the drainage district shall be notified of the assessment by publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the drainage district and by first-class mail to the name and address that appears on the last city or township assessment roll. An affidavit of mailing shall be made by the drain commissioner. The affidavit is conclusive proof that the notices required by this subsection were mailed. The failure of a person to receive a notice by mail is not a jurisdictional defect invalidating a drain assessment if notice by publication was given as required by this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An assessment under subsection (6) for the actual cost of inspection, repair, and maintenance performed on a drain, or an assessment under subsection (3) to be deposited in the drain fund of a drainage district, shall be made according to benefits received. The expenditure limit of the amount established in subsection (4) per mile or fraction of a mile of drain shall be used to calculate the maximum amount that the drain commissioner or drainage board may assess in any 1 year without a petition or a request from a public corporation. Determination of the maximum assessment amount allowed without petition or request, or of the property that is subject to assessment, shall be based on the number of miles of drain and areas of the drainage district receiving benefits and not on the actual number of miles or actual location of the inspection, repair, and maintenance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If an emergency condition exists that endangers the public health, crops, or property within a drainage district, and the drain commissioner or drainage board enters an order declaring and describing the emergency, the commissioner or drainage board may expend funds for maintenance and repair to alleviate the emergency condition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The drain commissioner or drainage board shall not levy an additional assessment for drain maintenance under this section if there is currently an assessment for previous maintenance work on the drain under this section unless subsection (8) applies or the expenditure for maintenance is approved by the governing body of each township, city, and village affected by more than 20% of the cost.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The drain commissioner or the drainage board may expend funds in excess of the amount established in subsection (4) per mile or fraction of a mile in any 1 year for inspection, maintenance, and repair of a drain if requested by a public corporation and if the public corporation pays the entire cost of the inspection, maintenance, and repair.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) In computing the amounts that may be expended under this section, the cost of work to be performed by a federal agency or public corporation that is not chargeable to the county or intercounty drainage district shall not be included. The drain commissioner or the drainage board is not required to advertise for bids for that portion of the work to be done by the federal agency or public corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) For purposes of this section, the costs of maintenance and repair include all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The cost of maintaining the drain in working order to continue a normal flow of water, including the servicing or repair of necessary pumping equipment and utility charges for pumping equipment. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The cost of keeping the drain free from rubbish, debris, siltation, or obstructions. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The cost of repairing a portion or all of a tile or drain to continue the normal flow of water. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Other costs associated with the costs described in subdivisions (a) to (c).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The dollar amount limitations in subsections (4), (6), and (7) do not apply to expenditures or assessments to the extent the expenditures or assessments are necessary to pay utility charges or costs to service pumping stations, sewage treatment facilities, or detention or retention basins. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) Except as otherwise provided in this act, that portion of the salaries, expenses, and fringe benefits of administrative and engineering employees under the supervision of the drain commissioner that are directly attributable, but not incidental, to a drain and not otherwise recovered by fees established by resolution or ordinance of the board of commissioners may be charged to the drain fund of a drainage district.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Upon receipt of a petition filed under this chapter, the drain commissioner or the drainage board may retain the services of a licensed professional surveyor or engineer to make a survey of the drain and may review the drainage district boundaries, or a portion of the drain or drainage district, or if necessary, lay out a revised drainage district including the land benefited, or make profiles, plans, or estimates of the work and file all data concerning the revisions, profiles, plans, or estimates with the drain commissioner or the chairperson of the drainage board. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If, after a survey of the drain or a review of the drainage district boundaries under subsection (1) or after an inspection under section 196, it appears that the boundaries of the drainage district should be revised, the drain commissioner for a county drain, or the drainage board for an intercounty drain, shall either convene the board of determination pursuant to subsection (4) or hold a day of review of district boundaries pursuant to subsection (5) and, after notice and review as provided in this section, revise the boundaries of the drainage district to include all lands benefited by the drain as recommended by a licensed professional surveyor or engineer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If, after an inspection under section 196 and a review of the drainage district boundaries, a drain commissioner or drainage board determines that the boundaries should be revised and that lands, in a county or counties not part of the original drainage district, should be added to the drainage district or lands in an intercounty drainage district should be removed resulting in the removal of a county from the intercounty drainage district, the drain commissioner or drainage board shall serve notice on the director of agriculture and rural development and the drain commissioner of each county where there are lands proposed to be added to or removed from the drainage district. The director of the department of agriculture and rural development shall call a meeting of the drainage board, which shall include the commissioner of each county where the drainage district or proposed revised drainage district is located. At least 10 days before the date of the meeting, the drainage board shall send notice of the meeting by first-class mail to each city, village, and township in the original or proposed revised district and each person whose name appears on the last city or township tax assessment roll as owning lands in the original or proposed revised drainage district, at the address shown on the roll. If an address does not appear on the roll, notice need not be mailed to that person. At the meeting, all persons owning lands in the drainage district or proposed revised drainage district liable to assessment for benefits, or any municipality affected, may appear for or against the addition or removal of the lands. The drainage board shall consider any evidence offered and determine whether the addition or removal of the lands is just and equitable. If the addition or removal of the lands is just and equitable, the board shall file an order to that effect. The order shall give the drain a name or number, designate the drainage district, describe the route and course of the drain and drainage district boundaries, and, if the drainage district as revised is an intercounty drainage district, designate the members constituting the revised drainage board and determine the apportionment between counties. A copy of the order shall be filed with the drain commissioner of each county liable for assessments of the drainage district. If the drainage district as revised is an intercounty drainage district, after the order is filed, the revised drainage board constitutes the drainage board for the revised drainage district and has all the powers and duties of drainage boards under this act. If the drainage district as revised is an intercounty drainage district, the revised drainage board shall revise the drainage district boundaries during the hearing of necessity as provided in subsection (4) or hold a day of review of drainage district boundaries as provided in subsection (5). If the drainage district as revised is a county drainage district, the original drainage board shall revise the drainage district boundaries during the hearing of necessity as provided in subsection (4) or hold a day of review of drainage district boundaries as provided in subsection (5) and, following the order revising the drainage district boundaries, the drain commissioner shall have all the powers and duties for a county drain established under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If, before the hearing of necessity for a petition, the drain commissioner or drainage board determines that the boundaries of the drainage district should be revised, the drain commissioner for a county drain, or the chairperson of the drainage board for an intercounty drain, may request that the board of determination revise the drainage district boundaries during the hearing of necessity as provided in section 72 or 122. If the board of determination by a majority vote of members finds that the addition or deletion of lands will more accurately define the boundaries of the land benefited by the drain and it would be just and equitable, the board shall describe the revised drainage district boundaries in the order of necessity for the drain.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the drain commissioner or drainage board determines to hold a day of review of drainage district boundaries, the lands comprising the drainage district revised under this section shall be subject to review for not less than 1 day from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. The review shall be conducted at a location designated by the drain commissioner or drainage board. At the review, the drain commissioner or drainage board or its designee shall hear the proofs and allegations and shall carefully reconsider and review the description of land comprised within the drainage district. If the drain commissioner or drainage board finds that the addition or deletion of lands will more accurately define the boundaries of the land benefited by the drain and it would be just and equitable, the drain commissioner or drainage board shall issue an order describing and establishing the revised drainage district boundaries supported by substantial, material, and competent evidence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A notice for review of revised drainage district boundaries under subsection (5) shall specify the date, time, and place at which the review will take place and provide a general description of the lands proposed in whole or in part to be added or removed from the drainage district. This notice shall be sent by first-class mail at least 10 days before the date of the review to each city, village, and township in the revised district, and each person whose name appears on the last city or township tax assessment roll as owning lands within the revised drainage district, at the address shown on the roll. If an address does not appear on the roll, then notice need not be mailed to that person. The drain commissioner or drainage board shall make an affidavit of the mailing and shall recite in the affidavit that the persons to whom the notice was mailed constitute all of the persons whose names and addresses appear on the tax rolls as owning lands within the revised drainage district. The affidavit is conclusive proof that notice was mailed to each person to whom notice is required to be mailed by this section. Failure to receive a notice by mail is not a jurisdictional defect invalidating a drain proceeding or assessment, if notice was sent by first-class mail as provided in this section. The drain commissioner or chairperson of the drainage board shall also cause the notice to be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which the drainage district is located at least 10 days before the review. All expense of notification shall be paid by the drainage district. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The owner of any land in the drainage district, the state transportation department, or any city, village, township, or county having control of any highway in the drainage district, that is aggrieved by a determination to revise, or not to revise, drainage district boundaries as provided for in this section may, within 10 days after the order to revise the drainage district boundaries is entered, institute an action in the circuit court for the county in which the real property is located for a determination of whether the decision to revise, or not to revise, the drainage district boundaries is supported by substantial, material, and competent evidence. The addition or removal of a county or counties to or from the drainage district under subsection (3) is subject to review in the manner provided in section 106.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The drain commissioner or drainage board shall advertise for sealed bids for projects petitioned for under section 71, 121, 191, or 192. The drain commissioner or drainage board shall receive sealed bids. All sealed bids received by the drain commissioner or drainage board shall be publicly opened at a meeting held at a time and place established by the notice under this act and may be examined at the meeting by any person interested. As soon as practical after the opening of bids, the drain commissioner or drainage board shall do the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Determine the lowest responsible bidder and award contracts, or reject all proposals and readvertise. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the drain commissioner or drainage board determined that the special assessments for benefits shall be collected in more than 1 installment, subject to section 275, determine the amount, form, maturity, mandatory redemption requirements, if any, and rate of interest of bonds to be issued. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The drain commissioner or drainage board shall also receive sealed bids as provided in subsection (1) for nonpetitioned maintenance work under section 196, unless the drain commissioner or drainage board utilizes 1 of the following to perform the work:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) County staff, including staff of the board of county road commissioners. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A prequalified contractor. To proceed under this subdivision, the drain commissioner or drainage board must maintain a list of all prequalified contractors for nonpetitioned maintenance work under section 196. The determination whether to list a contractor shall comply with prequalification criteria adopted by the drain commissioner or drainage board. The drain commissioner or drainage board shall make the list and criteria available on request. If a drain commissioner maintains an official internet presence, the drain commissioner shall post and maintain the drain commissioner's or drainage board's list and criteria on a portion of the website that is fully accessible to the public. If the drain commissioner does not maintain an official internet presence, the list shall be so posted and maintained on the county website.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a contract is not let within 5 years after the date of filing the petition to locate, establish, and construct, or deepen, widen, straighten, tile, extend or clean out a drain, the drain commissioner or drainage board may determine that the petition shall be considered abandoned and no further action shall be taken to construct the drain. The running of the 5-year period is suspended during any litigation to contest the validity of the proceedings. If, after the 5-year period, the drain commissioner or drainage board determines that the petition shall be considered abandoned, the drain commissioner or drainage board shall issue an order to that effect. Notice of the order shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the drainage district or sent by first-class mail to each person whose name appears on the last city, village, or township tax roll as owning land within the drainage district. The respective drain commissioner shall make an affidavit of the mailing and shall recite in the affidavit that the notice was mailed to all of the persons whose names and addresses appear upon the tax rolls as owning land within the drainage district in that county. The affidavit is conclusive proof that notice was mailed to each person to whom notice is required to be mailed by that drain commissioner under this subsection. The failure to receive a notice by mail is not a jurisdictional defect invalidating the abandonment of a petition if notice was sent by first-class mail as provided in this subsection. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The board of county road commissioners may bid on projects as provided in this section and, if a bid is accepted, may perform the work described in the bid and receive payment for the work performed. A bid tendered by a board of county road commissioners shall not be accepted unless the bid is at least 15% lower than any other bid tendered. The money received by the board of county road commissioners shall be credited to the county road fund. Expenditures incurred by the board of county road commissioners in performing work under this subsection are proper disbursements from the county road fund.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   All drain orders made by the commissioner shall state the services rendered in brief form, shall be numbered and recorded and signed by the commissioner. Such order, when due, shall be presented to the county clerk and he shall immediately ascertain from the county treasurer if the particular fund on which said order is drawn is sufficient to pay said order. If such fund is sufficient, the county treasurer shall so certify on the back of said drain order and the county clerk shall thereupon issue the usual county warrant upon the county treasurer for the payment of said order, taking said order so certified as his voucher. If such particular fund is insufficient when such order is presented for payment, the county treasurer shall so certify upon such order and such order shall then draw interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of presentation until such particular fund is sufficient to pay the same, said interest to be computed and paid with the principal out of the proper fund on which it was drawn, when there are sufficient funds to pay the same. The county treasurer shall keep a record in which he shall note each drain order presented for payment on a drain account which was insufficient to pay such order on the date of presentation. He shall note in such record the amount, number, drain account and the date of original presentation for payment. When there are sufficient moneys in the particular drain account to pay the order, plus interest, the county treasurer shall note the date of such sufficiency on such record and shall transfer sufficient moneys to pay such order and interest then due from the particular drain account and drain fund to a drain order redemption fund and the drain order shall cease to earn interest as of that date. Transfers to the drain order redemption fund shall be made in the order of priority in which the drain orders were originally presented for payment. Payment of such orders, including interest earned as provided herein, shall thereafter be made by the county treasurer from the drain order redemption fund. Drain orders at any time during the year in which such drain order becomes due and payable and for a period of 30 days prior to such year shall be accepted for the payment of drainage taxes. The county treasurer shall report to the commissioner the amount paid as interest on any and all such drain orders. The county treasurer shall at the first of each month furnish the drain commissioner with a report of all drain orders cashed during the preceding month, including the name of the drain upon which the order was drawn, the amount, the number of the order, and the date of payment.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whenever it is necessary to lay out and establish, deepen or widen, or both, or extend or straighten a drain across the right of way or roadbed of any railroad, railway, telephone, telegraph, dam, electric, water, oil, gas or other power company, the same proceedings shall be had throughout in all respects as cases provided in this act for obtaining private lands, except as herein provided. The damages and compensation to be awarded by the special commissioners shall include the legal damages for the making of the opening required in the drain proceedings. After damages as aforesaid shall have been determined, it shall be the duty of the railroad, railway, telephone, telegraph, dam, electric, water, oil, gas or other power company, when notified by the commissioner so to do, to make and maintain the necessary opening through its roadbed or right of way and to build and maintain a suitable culvert or crossing for such drain. Notice in writing to make such opening and to construct such culvert shall be served upon such company by leaving a copy thereof with the ticket or freight agent or general officer of such railroad, railway, telephone, telegraph, dam, electric, water, oil, gas or other power company at least 30 days before such railroad, railway, telephone, telegraph, dam, electric, water, oil, gas or other power company shall become liable. In case such railroad, railway, telephone, telegraph, dam, electric, water, oil, gas or other power company shall neglect for 30 days after service of such notice as aforesaid, the commissioner shall have the right to petition the circuit court, in addition to any other remedies which may exist, of the county in which such crossing is located, to compel such company to make such opening forthwith; and such circuit court shall, if it finds there is legal right to such opening, order the same to be forthwith constructed by said company, and issue its writ of mandamus therefor. At least 10 days' notice shall be given such company of such application, and thereafter such proceedings shall follow the practice of circuit courts in mandamus proceedings. Said matter shall be heard and determined as speedily as practicable, and take precedence over all other cases which may be pending in such court. Such costs may be awarded the prevailing party as are awarded in other motions for mandamus.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Railroad or railway companies, telephone, telegraph, or pipeline companies and other utilities shall not obstruct established drains, nor shall they lessen the area of any drain through their track bed or right of way. The area herein referred to is a cross section of the drain.

In case it is proposed to construct a pipeline, sewer or conduit within, over or across any county, such construction shall be of a nature and laid at such a depth at the point of crossing of any established public drain as will not interfere with said established public drain. The consent of the county drain commissioner or board of public works of any municipality shall be obtained before the work of such construction is commenced and such drain commissioner is hereby authorized to grant such consent upon such terms and conditions as may be reasonable and proper under the circumstances then existing.

If necessary, issues of fact may be framed in such proceedings. In case the court shall find such drain to have been obstructed, it shall issue a preemptory mandamus compelling such company to remove such obstruction.

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>280.423 Discharge of certain sewage or waste matter into drains prohibited; construction to purify flow; petitions; order of determination; findings; construction of drain; plans and specifications; contracts; costs; review; acquisition of land; application and fee for sewer connections; powers of drain commissioner or drainage board; failure to comply with section; violation as misdemeanor; fine; “person” defined.</B><P>
</P>
<P>Sec. 423.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   A person shall not continue to discharge or permit to be discharged into any county drain or intercounty drain of the state any sewage or waste matter capable of producing in the drain detrimental deposits, objectionable odor nuisance, injury to drainage conduits or structures, or capable of producing such pollution of the waters of the state receiving the flow from the drains as to injure livestock, destroy fish life, or be injurious to public health. This section does not prohibit the conveyance of sewage or other waste through drains or sewers that will not produce these injuries and that comply with section 3112 of part 31 (water resources protection) of the natural resources and environmental protection act, Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being section 324.3112 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Disposal plants, filtration beds, and other mechanical devices to properly purify the flow of any drain may be constructed as a part of any established drain, and the cost of construction shall be paid for in the same manner as provided for in this act for other drainage costs. Plants, beds, or devices may be described in the petition for the location, establishment and construction of drains or in the petition for the cleaning, widening, deepening, straightening, or extending of drains, or in the application for the laying out of a drainage district. Petitions for the construction of plants, beds, and devices for use on any established drain may be filed by the same persons and shall be received and all proceedings on the petitions in the same manner as other petitions for any drainage construction under this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If the department of environmental quality determines that sewage or wastes carried by any county or intercounty drain constitutes unlawful discharge as prescribed by section 3109 or 3112 of part 31 of Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.3109 and 324.3112 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, that 1 or more users of the drain are responsible for the discharge of sewage or other wastes into the drain, and that the cleaning out of the drain or the construction of disposal plants, filtration beds, or other mechanical devices to purify the flow of the drain is necessary, the department of environmental quality may issue to the drain commissioner an order of determination identifying such users and pollutants, under section 3112 of Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being section 324.3112 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. The order of determination constitutes a petition calling for the construction of disposal facilities or other appropriate measures by which the unlawful discharge may be abated or purified. The order of determination serving as a petition is in lieu of the determination of necessity by a drainage board pursuant to chapter 20 or 21 or section 122 or 192 or a determination of necessity by a board of determination pursuant to section 72 or 191, whichever is applicable. A copy of the findings of the department shall be attached to the order of determination which shall require no other signature than that of the director of the department of environmental quality. Upon receipt of the order of determination, the drain commissioner or the drainage board shall proceed as provided in this act to locate, establish, and construct a drain. If the responsible users of the drain are determined to be public corporations in the drainage district, the drain commissioner or the drainage board shall proceed as provided in chapters 20 and 21, as may be appropriate, using the order of determination as the final order of determination of the drainage board. If the responsible users are determined to be private persons, the drain commissioner shall proceed as provided in chapters 8 and 9, using the order of determination as the first order of determination.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   Plans and specifications for the construction as part of a drain of any disposal plant, filtration bed, or other mechanical device to properly purify the flow of the drain shall be prepared by the drain commissioner or the drainage board. Contracts for construction shall be let in the manner provided in this act. To meet the cost of any preliminary engineering studies for the construction of abatement or purification facilities, the drain commissioner or the drainage board shall apportion the cost among the several parcels of land, highways, and municipalities benefited thereby in the same manner as provided in chapter 7 or against the public corporations affected by the order of determination in the same manner as provided in chapters 20 and 21. The costs and charges for maintenance shall be apportioned and assessed each year. If the apportionment is the same as the last recorded apportionment, a day of review or a hearing on apportionments is not necessary, but if the apportionment is changed, notice of a day of review or a hearing on apportionments shall be given to each person whose percentage is raised.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Land may be acquired as a site for the construction of such plants, beds, and devices, and releases of land may be obtained in the same manner as provided in this act for other lands acquired for right of way. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   A person shall not connect sewage or other waste to a county or intercounty drain except with the written approval of the appropriate commissioner or the drainage board indorsed upon a written application for such service and the payment of a service fee of not to exceed $50.00 for each connection to a covered drain. The application shall include information showing that all other local, state, and federal approvals related to the sewage or waste have been obtained.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   The fee provided for in subsection (6) shall be set and collected by the drain commissioner, as approved by the county board of commissioners or the drainage board, and deposited with the county treasurer, to be credited to the drain fund set up for the maintenance or construction of the drain. The commissioner or the drainage board shall keep a record of applications made and the action on the applications. The commissioner or the drainage board may reject applications for or require such modification in requested applications for sewer connections to county drains as necessary to attain the objectives set forth in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)    Subject to the review and approval of the department of environmental quality, the drain commissioner or drainage board may study the requirements of persons for flood control or drainage projects including sewage disposal systems, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, combined sanitary and storm sewers, sewage treatment plants, and all other plants, works, instrumentalities, and properties useful in connection with the collection, treatment, and disposal of sewage and industrial wastes or agricultural wastes or run-off, to abate pollution or decrease the danger of flooding. The objective of such studies shall be that sewers, drains, and sewage disposal facilities are made available to persons situated within the territorial limits of any drainage district or proposed drainage district as necessary for the protection of public health and the promotion of the general welfare.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   The drainage board or drain commissioner may cooperate, negotiate, and enter into contracts with other governmental units and agencies or with any public or private corporation including the United States of America, and to take such steps and perform such acts and execute such documents as may be necessary to take advantage of any act of the congress of the United States which may make available funds for any of the purposes described in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   Failure to comply with any of the provisions of this section subjects the offender to the penalties described in section 602. However, for each offense, a person who violates subsection (6) is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $25,000.00 or imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both. In addition, the person may be required to pay the costs of prosecution and the costs of any emergency abatement measures taken to protect public health or the environment. Payment of a fine or costs under this subsection does not relieve a person of liability for damage to natural resources or for response activity costs under the natural resources and environmental protection act, Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.101 to 324.90106 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   As used in this section, "person" means an individual, partnership, public or private corporation, association, governmental entity, or other legal entity.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 424.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whenever a disposal plant, filtration plant or other mechanical device to purify the flow of such drain or sewer has been heretofore constructed, but is inoperative or improperly operated and, in the opinion of the state commissioner of health, the public health is endangered by reason thereof, said state commissioner of health may file with the judge of probate of the county in which said facilities are located, a petition reciting his findings and recommendations as to how the menace to health may be corrected or the nuisance may best be abated and how the improperly operated or inoperative disposal plant, filtration plant or other mechanical device to purify the flow of a drain or sewer should be operated. Upon satisfying himself as to the reasonableness of said recommendations, it shall be the duty of the judge of probate of said county to direct the drain commissioner of said county to prepare a plan for and estimate the annual cost of executing the recommendations of the state commissioner of health, and/or of rehabilitation, ordinary maintenance and operation of said improperly operated or inoperative facilities, to prepare a map showing the extent of the area contributing to said condition, and to make a determination of the annual expense thereof apportioned according to benefits to the state highways, cities, villages and townships benefited by the same. Upon receipt of the map, tentative assessment district and other information from the county drain commissioner, the judge of probate shall give notice of said facts and of the date of receiving appeals by publication in at least 2 insertions in some newspaper published and of general circulation in the county, if there be one, the first publication to be at least 10 days before the date set for receiving appeals and said notice shall also be posted at least 10 days before the date for receiving appeals in 5 or more conspicuous places in each city, village and township, where any part of the district may be located and within the limits of such district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The state highway commissioner or any city, township or village which may feel aggrieved by the apportionment of benefits so made by the drain commissioner may make an application to said probate court for review of the apportionment by a board of review by filing with said probate court a notice of appeal. Only 1 board of review shall be appointed by said court. Upon receipt of any such notices of appeal, as hereinbefore provided, the probate court shall forthwith notify the drain commissioner, in writing, of such appeal and thereupon make an order appointing 3 disinterested freeholders of such county, not residents of said district, to constitute such board of review. The court shall thereupon, with the concurrence of the drain commissioner, immediately fix the time and place when and where said board of review shall meet to review said apportionments, which said time shall be not less than 10 nor more than 15 days from the date of filing such appeal.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The drain commissioner shall thereupon give notice to the persons so appointed of their appointment and of the time and place of meeting and shall give notice of such meeting by posting notices in at least 5 public places in each city, village and township forming a part of the drainage district and shall serve a like notice upon the state highway commissioner and each of said cities, villages and townships. Such service shall be made not less than 5 days before hearing. Return shall be made by the person serving said notice and shall be filed in the office of the judge of probate. At such hearing the board of review shall have the right and it shall be their duty to review all apportionments made by the drain commissioner. Persons appointed on said board of review shall be sworn by the drain commissioner to faithfully discharge their duties as members of said board.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The board of review shall proceed at the time and place specified in the notice to hear the proofs and allegations of all parties in respect to the matter of appeal. A review of apportionments shall be made by the board of review and if, in their judgment, there shall be manifest error or inequality in such apportionments, they shall order and make such changes therein as they shall deem just and equitable. Determination of the drain commissioner, if not appealed from, or of said board, in case of an appeal, shall be final and there shall be no right of appeal from such determination, except by writ of certiorari to the proper court. The determination shall be reduced to writing and signed by the drain commissioner, or in case of appeal a majority of the board making the same, and shall be delivered to the judge of probate together with all other papers relating thereto. Upon the apportionments becoming final, as hereinbefore set forth, the judge of probate shall deliver said approved roll of apportionments of benefits and expense to the drain commissioner, who shall assess the amounts therein set forth to the respective cities, villages and townships involved, and said cities, villages and townships shall thereafter make payment thereof as collected in quarterly installments to the county treasurer to be deposited in a separate fund for the rehabilitation, ordinary maintenance and operation of said facilities, which said fund shall be paid out only on the order of the drain commissioner of the county in which said facilities are located.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Payment for services and providing for substitute membership necessary on the board of review shall be in accordance with sections 158 and 159 of this act. Such necessary costs of the proceeding shall be determined by the judge of probate, said cost to be paid from the revolving fund of the county and same to be returned to the county out of the first assessment against said district. Immediately upon receipt of sufficient funds so to do, the drain commissioner of the county shall proceed with the rehabilitation, ordinary maintenance and operation of said facilities, and shall continue the same as long as funds are available. The costs and charges hereinbefore set forth shall be an annual charge and shall be assessed against the state highways and the several cities, villages and townships by said drain commissioner each year as long as said facility continues to be operated, unless in the opinion of the drain commissioner, the state highway commissioner or of any of said cities, villages or townships, said apportionment should be changed, in which event either said drain commissioner, the state highway commissioner, or any of said cities, villages or townships may petition the judge of probate of the county in which said proceedings were had for the appointment of a board of review to reapportion said expense, and on filing said petition said judge of probate shall proceed to appoint a board of review on notice and in the manner hereinbefore set forth, which said board of review shall review such assessments and make a new apportionment: Provided, however, That no reapportionment shall be made oftener than once in each calendar year.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The several cities, villages and townships against whom an assessment is made, as hereinbefore provided, shall collect for such expense so assessed to them under this act by charges for the use of said facilities, to be added to and collected with the water rates of said cities, villages and townships, in the same manner as other water rates of said cities, villages and townships are collected, or in such other manner as the several governing bodies of said respective cities, villages and townships may determine.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 425.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   A landowner in the drainage district whose land requires additional drainage may petition the commissioner for permission to construct an open or closed drain, or a combination thereof, to a regularly established drain, and permission shall be granted by the commissioner or drainage board when, in their opinion, the nature of the ground to be crossed will admit thereof and the surface of the land can be restored and for that purpose the drain may traverse the lands of other freeholders in the district. Before permission may be granted by the commissioner, consent in writing by the owner or owners of the lands to be traversed by the proposed drain shall be obtained. If permission is refused by the owner or owners of the lands to be traversed by the proposed drain, the drain may be established by following the provisions of this act governing the location, establishment, and construction of county or intercounty drainage districts and drains therein. The entire expense thereof shall be borne by the petitioner, and the construction of an open or closed drain or combination thereof shall be done at a time and in a manner as the commissioner or drainage board shall prescribe. When drains are constructed, the drain entrance shall be substantially protected from driftwood and debris. An application to lay out and designate a drainage district or petition to locate, establish, and construct a drain under the foregoing provisions of this section shall only require the signature of the petitioning landowner or owners, other provisions of this act notwithstanding. If permission is granted to tile the source of a drain, the commissioner shall further prescribe the amount and part of the drain to be tiled and the manner of tiling. A person through whose land an open drain has been established and constructed may make a written request to the county drain commissioner to be permitted, at his own expense, to tile and cover with earth the whole or a part thereof that may traverse his land, and the commissioner may grant the request, but in doing so he shall prescribe the size of the tile to be used. A permit shall not be issued to tile or crock an established drain that will decrease the area of the drain as established.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 433.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An existing intracounty or intercounty drainage district may be enlarged and the drain located in the district may be extended or have branches added to provide drainage service to lands not originally within the boundaries of the drainage district by agreement between the drain commissioner or the drainage board and the owner of the lands; or if there is a developer of the lands who is not the owner, between the drain commissioner or the intercounty drainage board and the owner and the developer of the lands. The agreement shall obligate the owner and the developer, if any, of the lands to be added to the drainage district to construct, in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by or approved by the drain commissioner or drainage board, the necessary and adequate drainage facilities on the lands to be added and in the existing drainage district to connect the lands to the existing drain in the drainage district and to pay the cost of the drainage facilities including right of way, engineering, inspection, administration, and legal expenses incurred by the drain commissioner or the drainage board, or to deposit with the drain commissioner or drainage board, upon execution of the agreement, the estimated cost of the construction and expenses.</DIV>

If the existing drain in the existing drainage district has been financed by the levy of drain special assessments on the lands in the drainage district and if the basis of special assessment as applied to the lands to be added to the drainage district would result in a drain special assessment on the lands to be added in an aggregate principal amount greater than the costs and expenses to be paid or incurred by the owner and developer, if any, of the lands for the new drain facilities at the time of entering into the agreement, then the owner or developer shall also pay the amount of the excess to the drainage district at the time of execution of the agreement. In addition, the developer or owner of the added lands shall pay a pro rata equitable share of the cost of the original construction of the drain, if any.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Lands added to any drainage district by agreement shall be liable from and after the date of agreement for all assessments levied after the date of the agreement for operation and maintenance of the drain, including the extension of the drain pursuant to the agreement, and the lands shall be a part of the drainage district for all other purposes and procedures set forth in this act. All drain facilities and all rights of way, easements, or property in which the facilities are located, acquired, or constructed pursuant to the agreement to add lands shall be dedicated to public use or conveyed or transferred to the drainage district and the drain facilities shall be a part of the drain the same as if originally located, established, and constructed by procedures set forth in this act as a part of the original drain.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   An existing intracounty or intercounty drain may be extended or have branches added to provide additional service to lands within the drainage district by agreement between the drain commissioner or the drainage board and the owner of the lands; or if there is a developer of the lands who is not the owner, between the drain commissioner or the drainage board and the owner and the developer of the lands, pursuant to the procedures and conditions set forth in this section. The affected public corporations or municipalities in which the proposed lands are to be added will be apprised of the agreement by the drain commissioner or drainage board and who shall also publish notice of the agreement in a newspaper of general circulation in the drainage district in question.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   By agreement with a landowner and the developer, if any, the drain commissioner or intercounty drainage board may establish an existing private drain which was constructed by the landowner or developer to service an area on his or her own land as a county or intercounty drain.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If a drain established pursuant to subsection (5) adds lands to an existing drainage district, the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) shall apply.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If a drain established pursuant to subsection (5) is independent from an existing drainage district, a certificate shall be obtained, at the expense of the landowner or developer of the lands served by the proposed drain, from a registered professional engineer satisfactory to the drain commissioner or the intercounty drainage board to the effect that the outlet for the existing drain is the only reasonably available outlet for the drain and that there is sufficient capacity in the existing outlet for the proposed drain to serve as an adequate outlet without detriment to or diminution of the drainage service which the outlet presently provides. All drain facilities and all rights of way, easements, or property in which the facilities are located, acquired, or constructed pursuant to the agreement to establish the drain shall be dedicated to public use or conveyed or transferred to the drainage district and the drain facilities and drainage district shall be an established drain and drainage district the same as if originally laid out and designated, located, established, and constructed by procedures set forth in this act. All plans and specifications, including a map and a description of the drainage district, pertaining to the private drain as may be required by the drain commissioner or intercounty drainage board shall be furnished to the drain commissioner or intercounty drainage board.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   The landowner or developer who transfers a drain pursuant to subsection (5) shall deposit with the drain commissioner or drainage board 5% of the cost of the drain but not more than $2,500.00. The money received by the drain commissioner or intercounty drainage board pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in a special drain fund which shall be used for the future maintenance of the transferred drain.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 441.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Two or more drainage districts located in the same county and in the same drainage basin or in adjoining basins, may consolidate and organize as a single drainage district upon the filing of a petition for consolidation with the drain commissioner of the county setting forth the reason for the proposed consolidation. The consolidation may include land not within an existing drainage district if requested in the petition. The petition shall be signed by at least 50 property owners within the proposed consolidated drainage district. If in the proposed consolidated drainage district there are less than 100 property owners, the petition shall be signed by at least 50% of the property owners in the proposed consolidated drainage district. In place of a petition signed by property owners, a petition may be signed solely by a city or township a portion of which is located within the proposed consolidated drainage district, when authorized by its governing body, or by a combination of municipalities. As soon as practicable after the filing of a petition, the drain commissioner, if not disqualified under section 381, may appoint a board of determination composed of 3 disinterested property owners to determine the necessity of the consolidation. If the commissioner is disqualified or chooses not to appoint the board of determination, the commissioner shall immediately file a copy of the petition with the chairperson of the county board of commissioners, together with a statement signed by the commissioner showing that he or she is disqualified or chooses not to act in appointing a board of determination. Upon receiving a copy of the petition and certificate, the chairperson of the county board of commissioners, if not privately interested, shall appoint as soon as practicable a board of determination and shall immediately notify the drain commissioner of the names and addresses of those appointed. If the chairperson of the county board of commissioners has a private interest in the proceedings, the drain committee of the county board of commissioners shall appoint the board of determination. Members of a board of determination shall be residents of the county but not of the proposed consolidated drainage district or of a drainage district a part of which is to be included in the proposed consolidation. A meeting of the board of determination shall be called within the proposed consolidated drainage district at some convenient place to be designated by the drain commissioner. If a person appointed to the board of determination fails or refuses to serve, a successor shall be appointed by the official or committee making the appointment in the first instance. The compensation of a member of the board of determination shall be $8.00 per day with no additional allowance for mileage. The county board of commissioners of a county may increase the per diem compensation of members of the board of determination.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The drain commissioner shall give notice of the time, date, and place of the meeting in the manner prescribed by Act No. 267 of the Public Acts of 1976 and by publication twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed consolidated drainage district, the first publication of which shall be at least 10 days before the meeting. Notices shall also be served on the county clerk and the clerk of each township or city in the proposed consolidated drainage district, personally or by registered mail at least 10 days before the meeting. The drain commissioner shall also send notice by first-class mail of the time, date, and place of the meeting at least 10 days before the date of the meeting to each person whose name appears on the last city or township tax assessment roll as owning land within the existing drainage districts, a portion of which is proposed to be consolidated, or owning lands within the proposed consolidated drainage district whose land is not within an existing drainage district, at the address shown on the roll. If an address does not appear on the roll, then a notice need not be mailed to those persons. The drain commissioner shall make an affidavit of the mailing and shall recite in the affidavit that the persons to whom the notice was mailed constitute all of the persons to whom notice must be sent. The affidavit shall be conclusive proof that notice was mailed to each person to whom notice is required to be mailed by this section. The failure to receive a notice by mail shall not constitute a jurisdictional defect invalidating a drain proceeding if notice has been sent by first-class mail as provided in this section. All expense of notification shall be paid by the drainage district when created.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   At the time and place fixed in the notice the board shall meet, elect a chairperson and a secretary, and proceed to determine whether the proposed consolidation is conducive to public health, convenience, or welfare. After hearing the evidence, the board shall make its determination as to whether the proposed consolidation is conducive to public health, convenience, or welfare. If the board finds by a majority vote of the members that the proposed consolidation is not conducive to public health, convenience, or welfare, it shall file with the commissioner an order dismissing the petition, and a further petition for the drain shall not be entertained within 1 year after the determination. If the board by a majority vote finds that the proposed consolidation is conducive to the public health, convenience, or welfare, it shall make its order to that effect and file the order with the commissioner. Upon receipt of the order of consolidation, the commissioner shall enter an order giving the consolidated drainage district a name or number.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 441a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Two or more drainage districts may be consolidated and organized as a single drainage district under this section where the proposed consolidated district lies within more than 1 county, by filing a petition in writing with the commissioner of a county having jurisdiction of land in the proposed consolidated drainage district, setting forth the reason for the proposed consolidation. The consolidation may include land not within an existing drainage district if requested in the petition. The petition shall be signed by at least 50 property owners within the proposed consolidated drainage district. If in the proposed consolidated drainage district there are less than 100 property owners, then the petition shall be signed by at least 50% of the property owners in the proposed consolidated drainage district. In place of a petition signed by property owners, a petition may be signed solely by a city or township a portion of which is located within the proposed consolidated drainage district, when authorized by its governing body, or by a combination of municipalities. Upon receipt of the petition, the commissioner shall notify the director of the department of agriculture and the commissioner of each county embracing land in the proposed consolidated drainage district. The drain commissioners of the counties and the director of the department of agriculture or a deputy designated by the director shall constitute the drainage board.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The director of the department of agriculture shall call a meeting of the drainage board not less than 15 days or more than 60 days after the receipt of the notice. The meeting shall be held in the immediate locality of the proposed consolidated drainage district. Notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered mail, at least 10 days before the meeting on the clerk of each county, township, and city within the proposed consolidated drainage district. A notice of the meeting shall be given in the manner prescribed by Act No. 267 of the Public Acts of 1976, and shall be published twice in each county affected in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed consolidated drainage district, the first publication of which shall be at least 10 days before the meeting. The drain commissioner of each county in which land proposed to be consolidated into the proposed consolidated district is located shall also send notice of the time, date, and place of the meeting by first-class mail, at least 10 days before the date of the meeting, to each person whose name appears upon the last city or township tax assessment roll as owning land within the existing drainage districts to be consolidated, or owning land within the proposed consolidated drainage district which is not within an existing drainage district, at the address shown on the roll. If an address does not appear on the roll, a notice need not be mailed to the persons. Each drain commissioner shall make an affidavit of the mailing and shall recite in the affidavit that the persons to whom the notice was mailed constitute all of the persons to whom notice must be sent. The affidavits shall be conclusive proof that notice was mailed to each person to whom notice is required to be mailed by this section. The failure to receive notice by mail shall not constitute a jurisdictional defect invalidating a drain proceeding, if notice has been sent by first-class mail as provided in this section. All expense of notification shall be paid by the drainage district when created or consolidated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Upon convening the meeting, the director of the department of agriculture or a deputy selected by the director shall act as chairperson. The drainage board shall consider the application for the proposed consolidated drainage district, and determine the sufficiency of the signatures to the application. The drainage board shall then proceed to determine whether the proposed consolidation is conducive to public health, convenience, or welfare.

If the board by a majority vote finds that the proposed consolidation is conducive to the public health, convenience, or welfare, it shall make its order to that effect and file the order with the chairperson. Upon receipt of the order of consolidation, the chairperson shall enter an order giving the consolidated drainage district a name or number. A copy of the order shall be filed within 10 days by the director of the department of agriculture in the office of the county drain commissioner of each county in which land included in the consolidated drainage district is located.</DIV>

In that case the vice-chairperson or chairperson pro tempore of the county board of commissioners or of the finance committee of the county board of commissioners, if not also disqualified, shall act as the member. If the vice-chairperson or chairperson pro tempore is disqualified, the drain commissioner of the county shall designate a member of the county board of commissioners who is not disqualified to act as a member of the drainage board for the project. The chairperson of the county board of commissioners and any member of a county board of commissioners serving on the drainage board shall receive the compensation, mileage, and expenses as provided by the drainage board. However, compensation paid to a member shall not exceed $25.00 per diem, exclusive of mileage and expenses, for attendance at drainage board meetings. The county drain commissioner shall be chairperson of the drainage board. The chairperson shall keep minutes of the proceedings of the drainage board and all records and files of the board shall be kept in his or her office. In counties of less than 500,000 population, the commissioner shall be paid the same compensation as other members of the drainage board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a county is organized under a charter adopted under 1966 PA 293, MCL 45.501 to 45.521, and the charter prescribes an elected county executive, the drainage board shall consist of the following members:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The person designated by the charter to carry out the administrative duties of the drain commissioner or that person's designee, who shall also serve as chairperson of the drainage board.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The county commissioner whose district will be assessed for the greatest portion of the cost of the project, or that county commissioner's designee. The determination of which county commissioner is qualified to sit under this subdivision shall initially be made by the chairperson of the drainage board when the petition for the project is filed. After the final order of apportionment is issued under section 469, the county commissioner who qualifies under this section shall become the county commissioner member and serve until another apportionment is established requiring the seating of another commissioner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A person appointed by the county executive with the advice and consent of a majority of the members of the county board of commissioners elected or appointed and serving.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In a county described in subsection (2), the requirements in this chapter for substantive actions and determinations shall be followed in administering each project petitioned for under this chapter, subject to and in accordance with any applicable provisions of the county charter.</div>

<P>Sec. 474.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The special assessment roll shall contain the name of each public corporation assessed, the total estimated cost of the project, or actual cost if the same has been ascertained at the time of the preparation of the roll, the percentage apportioned to each public corporation, the amount of the assessment against each public corporation based upon the percentage of apportionment, and the amount of each installment if the assessment is divided into annual installments. After the special assessment roll has been prepared, it shall be presented to the drainage board for approval. When the roll has been approved, then a statement to that effect, signed by the chairman of the drainage board, shall be affixed to the roll setting forth the date of approval. The chairman of the drainage board shall then certify to each public corporation assessed the amount of the total assessment against it, the amount of the various installments if the assessment is divided into installments, the due date of each installment, and the rate of interest upon installments from time to time unpaid. The chairman each year, at least 30 days before the time of the levying of taxes by each public corporation, shall notify it of the amount of the installment and interest next becoming due, but the failure to notify a public corporation shall not excuse it from making payment of the installment and interest. On or before the due date of an installment, each public corporation shall pay to the county treasurer the full amount thereof, together with interest accruing to the due date. If a public corporation fails or neglects to account to the county treasurer for the amount of an installment and interest, then the county treasurer shall advance the amount thereof from county funds if bonds or other evidences of indebtedness have been issued to finance the project, in anticipation of the collection of the installment and interest pursuant to this chapter and the county board of commissioners has previously acted, by a resolution adopted by a 2/3 vote of its members elect, to pledge the full faith and credit of the county for the prompt payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds or evidences of indebtedness.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The county treasurer shall immediately notify the public corporation of the amount advanced by the county on account of the default by the public corporation in paying the installment and interest assessed against it. The county treasurer shall also notify the state treasurer, or other appropriate disbursing official, who shall deduct the amount from moneys in his possession belonging to the public corporation which are not pledged to the payment of debts, but the state treasurer or other official shall not withhold in any 1 year a sum greater than 25% of the total amount owed by the delinquent public corporation as stated in the notice from the county treasurer. Nothing in this section shall permit the deduction of moneys in contravention of the state constitution of 1963.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The county board of commissioners of a county which has advanced money for a public corporation and which has not been reimbursed therefor, may order the public corporation and its officers to levy upon its next tax roll an amount sufficient to make the reimbursement on or before the date when its taxes become delinquent; and the public corporation and its tax levying and collecting officials shall levy and collect those taxes and reimburse the county. The foregoing shall not prevent the county from obtaining reimbursement by any other legal method. Assessments against the state shall be certified to the state highway commission and paid from state highway funds. The tax levying officials of each of the other public corporations assessed shall levy sufficient taxes to pay assessment installments and interest as the same become due unless there has been set aside moneys sufficient therefor. A city or village may elect to spread the tax levy upon the county tax roll instead of the city or village tax roll. If a special assessment roll is prepared upon the basis of the estimated cost of the project, then after the actual cost has been ascertained and determined by the drainage board, the special assessments and the installments thereof shall be corrected by adding any deficiency or deducting any excess. The drainage board may order the corrections to be made upon the original roll or may order that a new corrected roll or a supplemental roll be prepared and submitted for approval by the drainage board. When chapter 25 is employed in the apportionment of costs, the above proceedings shall be altered and supplemented as provided in chapter 25.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the legislative body of a public corporation, which is subject to assessment under this chapter pursuant to apportionments made under this chapter, determines that a part of the land in the public corporation will be especially benefited by a proposed drain project so that a special assessment, fee, or charge may be levied by the public corporation under section 490, the legislative body before filing a petition under section 463, shall do all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Send to the county drain commissioner by registered mail a notice of intent to file a petition under section 463. The notice shall include a request that the drain commissioner delineate a proposed drainage district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Prepare or cause to be prepared a proposed plan for financing the project.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Forward by first-class mail to each person whose name and address appears on the tax rolls as owning land within the proposed district, at the address shown on the last tax assessment roll of the public corporation, a notice which contains all of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   A general description of the proposed drain project.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)   Expected benefits of the proposed drain project.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)   Notice that the proposed project is to be fully or partly financed by special assessment against property owners within the proposed district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)   A statement that alternative plans of financing the proposed project will be on the meeting agenda.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(v)   Notice of the time, date, and place of a meeting to be held by the legislative body of the public corporation to hear objections to the proposed drain project or special assessment, fee, or charge to be levied under this section. Notice prescribed in this subparagraph shall be mailed not less than 10 days before the meeting, and in addition, shall be given in the manner prescribed by Act No. 267 of the Public Acts of 1976, as amended, being sections 15.261 to 15.275 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, and shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the public corporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The legislative body shall make an affidavit of the mailing and shall recite in the affidavit that the persons to whom the notice was mailed constitute all of the persons whose names and addresses appear upon the tax rolls as owning land within the proposed district, which affidavit shall be conclusive proof that notice was mailed to each person to whom notice is required to be mailed by the terms of this section. The failure to receive a notice by mail shall not constitute a jurisdictional defect invalidating a drain proceeding or tax, or both, if notice has been sent by first-class mail as provided in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The legislative body shall hold a meeting as described in subsection (1)(c)(v) to receive information from the public on the advisability of proceeding with the proposed drain project. The meeting shall be held in the manner prescribed by Act No. 267 of the Public Acts of 1976, as amended.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The legislative body, at any time before filing a petition under section 463, may do any of the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Determine to proceed with the proposed drain project and levy a special assessment, fee, or charge in substantially the same method as stated under section 490 and in the notices prepared and mailed pursuant to subsection (1)(c). A person whose name and address appears upon the tax rolls as owning land within the proposed district feeling aggrieved by this determination may appeal the decision of the legislative body by instituting an action in the circuit court for the county in which the real property is located. The action shall be filed by the person aggrieved within 45 days after the determination of the legislative body.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Determine to proceed with the proposed drain project without levying a special assessment, fee, or charge under section 490. A person whose name and address appears upon the tax rolls as owning land within the proposed district feeling aggrieved by this determination may appeal the decision of the legislative body by instituting an action in the circuit court for the county in which the real property is located. The action shall be filed by the person aggrieved within 45 days after the determination of the legislative body.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Reject or withdraw from the proposed drain project. A person whose name and address appears upon the tax rolls as owning land within the proposed district feeling aggrieved by this determination may appeal the decision of the legislative body by instituting an action in the circuit court for the county in which the real property is located. The action shall be filed by the person aggrieved within 45 days after the determination of the legislative body.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 490.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Subject to the requirements of section 489a, if the legislative body of a public corporation, which has been assessed under this chapter, determines that a part of the lands in the public corporation will be especially benefited by the drain project to the extent of a portion of the amount assessed under this chapter, the legislative body may cause that portion of the assessment under this chapter to be specially assessed, according to benefits, against the especially benefited lands, if the special assessment method of financing is not inconsistent with local financing policy for similar drains and sewers. The special assessment shall be made under the statutory or charter provisions governing special assessments in the public corporation to the extent applicable. However, if there is not another drain assessment in the district on this particular drain, the special assessment proceedings may be initiated by resolution of the legislative body of the public corporation without petition, after compliance with section 489a, and a petition or written objection in opposition to the levying of special assessments shall be advisory only and shall not require a petition for the project, except as otherwise provided in section 489a.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   After determining by resolution to proceed, the legislative body shall cause a special assessment roll to be prepared. After the special assessment roll is prepared, the proceedings with respect to the special assessment roll and the making and collection of the special assessments shall be conducted pursuant to the statute or charter governing special assessments in the public corporation. However, the total assessment may be divided into not more than 30 installments, and a person assessed, at the hearing upon the special assessment roll prepared by the public corporation, may object to the special assessment district previously established by the public corporation. Due consideration shall be given to the objections. A hearing held under this section shall not take the place of a meeting required under section 489a, unless notice is prepared and mailed in the manner prescribed by section 489a.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a special assessment is levied under this section, all collections from the special assessment shall be used towards the payment of the assessment at large against the public corporation. Each annual levy made for the payment of the assessment at large shall be reduced by the amount of money then on hand from special assessment collections available for this use.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   This section shall not be construed to prevent the assessment of public corporations at large under this chapter. In place of or in addition to levying special assessments, the public corporation, under the same conditions and for the same purpose, may exact connection, readiness to serve, availability, or service charges to be paid by owners of land directly or indirectly connected with the drain project, or a combination of projects, subject to section 489a.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The augmented drainage board, at its first meeting, shall consider the petition for the project and make a tentative determination as to the sufficiency of the petition and the practicability of the proposed drain, and further make a tentative determination of the public corporations to be assessed. The augmented drainage board shall give a name to the drain and to the drainage district. The district shall be composed of the public corporations to be assessed for the cost of the project. If the augmented drainage board, by resolution, tentatively determines that there should be assessed a public corporation in a county other than those contained in the tentative findings of the director of the department of agriculture, further proceedings shall not be taken by the augmented drainage board, but the resolution shall have the effect of amending the preliminary finding of the director of the department of agriculture. The director of the department of agriculture shall proceed, as in the first instance, to call a new meeting of the drainage board and the augmented drainage board as enlarged by reason of the inclusion of the additional public corporations in another county. After the augmented drainage board has made the determination specified in this section, it shall fix a time, date, and place it will meet to hear objections to the proposed drain and the petition for the drain, and the matter of assessing the cost of the drain to the designated public corporations. Notice of the hearing shall be published twice in each county involved by inserting the notice in at least 1 newspaper published in the county, designated by the augmented drainage board. The first publication shall be made not less than 20 days before the time of hearing. The notice shall also be sent by registered mail to the clerk or secretary of each public corporation proposed to be assessed, except that a notice to the state shall be sent to the state highway director and a notice to a county shall be sent to both the county clerk and the county road commission. The mailing shall be made not less than 20 days before the time of hearing. The notice shall be signed by the secretary and proof of the publication and mailing of the notice shall be filed with the secretary. The augmented drainage board may provide a form to be substantially followed in the giving of such notice. After the hearing, the augmented drainage board shall make a determination as to the sufficiency of the petition, the practicability of the drain, whether the drain should be constructed, the public corporations to be assessed, and shall issue its order accordingly. The order shall be known as the final order of determination. A public corporation shall not be eliminated from, or added to, those tentatively determined to be assessed without a rehearing after notice. After the augmented drainage board has made the determinations further action in respect to the drain shall be taken by the drainage board. The augmented drainage board may be reconvened by its chairperson or 2 members of the board, upon notice given for the purpose of making a correction or addition to its proceedings.</DIV>

In approving the plans and specifications, the drainage board is not limited to the route of the drain described in the petition or the final order of determination. Changes in the approved route and course of the drain must be approved by resolution of the drainage board. The drainage board shall tentatively establish the percentage of the cost of the drain or of the several sections or parts of the drain to be paid by public corporations in each county affected and by this state on account of any state highway, and by the county on account of any county road. The percentage of the cost apportioned to public corporations in each county shall then be apportioned by the drain commissioner among public corporations to be assessed in the county, and that apportionment shall be filed with the secretary of the drainage board. In making the apportionments under this section, there shall be taken into consideration the benefits to accrue to each public corporation and the extent to which each public corporation contributes to the conditions that make the drain necessary. Apportionments against this state shall be based upon benefits and contributions as related solely to the drainage of state highways. Apportionments against the county shall be based upon benefits and contributions as related solely to the drainage of its county roads. Before a tentative apportionment is made, the drainage board shall designate the area to be served by the drain project, which may include all of the area in a public corporation to be assessed, and may divide the drain into sections or parts for purposes of apportionment or construction. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, a county may assume any additional cost of the drain if 2/3 of the members elect of the county board of commissioners vote in favor thereof. The apportionment under this section applies only to the proposed drain. The apportionments for any extensions or other work subsequently performed under section 535 shall be reestablished by the board. If chapter 25 is employed in the apportionment of costs, the proceedings under this section shall be altered and supplemented as provided in chapter 25.</div>

<P>Sec. 525.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   After the confirmation of the apportionments by the drainage board, the secretary of the board shall prepare a special assessment roll assessing the estimated cost of the drain, or if the actual cost has been ascertained, then the actual cost, against the several public corporations in accordance with the confirmed apportionments.

Installments of assessments against the state and against public corporations which collect their taxes beginning approximately December 1 in each year shall become due and payable on or before April 1 of each year. Installments of assessments against other public corporations shall become due and payable on or before the dates as shall be fixed by the drainage board, depending upon the times of the collection of taxes by the public corporations. The drainage board shall fix the commencement date of interest to be paid upon unpaid installments, not to exceed an amount sufficient to pay interest on bonds or other evidences of indebtedness issued or to be issued by the drainage district, which interest shall become due annually on the day and month upon which the annual installments become due but may become due in years before the due date of the first installment. The drainage board may provide for the payment of installments in advance of their respective due dates and may prescribe the terms and conditions of payment. The drainage board shall fix the date, not later than 4 years after confirmation for the payment of the first installment so that each public corporation can make a tax levy for the payment thereof and subsequent installments shall become due annually on the same day and month of subsequent years. A city or village may elect to spread the tax levy upon the county tax roll instead of the city or village tax roll. When chapter 25 is employed in the apportionment of costs, the above proceedings shall be altered and supplemented as provided in chapter 25.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 526.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The special assessment roll shall contain the name of each public corporation assessed, the total estimated cost of the project, or actual cost if the same has been ascertained at the time of the preparation of the roll, the percentage apportioned to each public corporation, the amount of the assessment against each public corporation based upon the percentage of apportionment, and the amount of each installment if the assessment is divided into annual installments. After the special assessment roll has been prepared, it shall be presented to the drainage board for approval. When the roll has been approved, then a statement to that effect signed by the chairman and secretary of the drainage board shall be affixed to the roll setting forth the date of approval. The chairman of the drainage board shall then certify to each public corporation assessed, the amount of the total assessment against it, the amount of the various installments if the assessment is divided into installments, the due date of each installment, and the rate of interest upon installments from time to time unpaid. The chairman each year, at least 30 days before the time of the levying of taxes by each public corporation, shall notify it of the amount of the installment and interest next becoming due, but the failure to notify a public corporation shall not excuse it from making payment of the installment and interest. On or before the due date of an installment, each public corporation shall pay to its county treasurer the full amount together with interest accruing to the due date, and within 15 days thereafter the county treasurer shall forward the amount paid to the county treasurer acting as treasurer for the drainage board. If a public corporation fails or neglects to account to the county treasurer for the amount of an installment and interest, then the county treasurer shall advance the amount thereof from county funds.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If bonds or other evidences of indebtedness have been issued to finance the project in anticipation of the collection of the installment and interest pursuant to this chapter and the county board of commissioners has previously acted, by a resolution adopted by a 2/3 vote of its members elect to pledge the full faith and credit of the county for the prompt payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds or evidences of indebtedness, the county treasurer shall immediately notify the public corporation of the amount advanced by the county on account of the default by the public corporation in paying the installment and interest assessed against it. The county treasurer shall also notify the state treasurer, or other appropriate disbursing official, who shall deduct the amount from moneys in his possession belonging to the public corporation which are not pledged to the payment of debts, but the state treasurer or other official shall not withhold in any 1 year a sum greater than 25% of the total amount owed by the delinquent public corporation as stated in the notice from the county treasurer. Nothing in this section shall permit the deduction of moneys in contravention of the state constitution of 1963.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The county board of commissioners of a county which has advanced money for a public corporation, and which has not been reimbursed therefor, may order the public corporation and its officers to levy upon its next roll an amount sufficient to make the reimbursement on or before the date when its taxes become delinquent; and the public corporation and its tax levying and collecting officials shall levy and collect those taxes and reimburse the county. The foregoing shall not prevent the county from obtaining reimbursement by any other legal method. Assessments against the state shall be certified to the state highway commission and paid from state highway funds. The tax levying officials of each of the other public corporations assessed shall levy sufficient taxes to pay assessment installments and interest as the same become due unless there has been set aside money sufficient therefor. If a special assessment roll is prepared upon the basis of the estimated cost of the project, then after the actual cost has been ascertained and determined by the drainage board, the special assessments and the installments thereof shall be corrected by adding any deficiency or deducting any excess. The drainage board may order the corrections to be made upon the original roll or may order that a new corrected roll be prepared and submitted for approval by the drainage board. When chapter 25 is employed in the apportionment of costs, the above proceedings shall be altered and supplemented as provided in chapter 25.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The legislative body shall make an affidavit of the mailing and shall recite in the affidavit that the persons to whom the notice was mailed constitute all of the persons whose names and addresses appear upon the tax rolls as owning land within the proposed district, which affidavit shall be conclusive proof that notice was mailed to each person to whom notice is required to be mailed by the terms of this section. The failure to receive a notice by mail shall not constitute a jurisdictional defect invalidating a drain proceeding or tax, or both, if notice has been sent by first-class mail as provided in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The legislative body shall hold a meeting as described in subsection 1(c)(v) to receive information from the public on the advisability of proceeding with the proposed drain project.

The action shall be filed by the person aggrieved within 45 days after the determination of the legislative body.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Determine to proceed with the proposed drain project without levying a special assessment, fee, or charge under section 539. A person whose name and address appears upon the tax rolls as owning land within the proposed district feeling aggrieved by this determination may appeal the decision of the legislative body by instituting an action in the circuit court for the county in which the real property is located. The action shall be filed by the person aggrieved within 45 days after the determination of the legislative body.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Reject or withdraw from the proposed drain project.

<P>Sec. 539.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Subject to the requirements of section 538a, if the legislative body of a public corporation, which has been assessed under this chapter, determines that a part of the lands in the public corporation will be especially benefited by the drain project to the extent of a portion of the amount assessed under this chapter, the legislative body may cause that portion of the assessment under this chapter to be specially assessed, according to benefits, against the especially benefited lands if the special assessment method of financing is not inconsistent with local financing policy for similar drains and sewers. The special assessment shall be made under the statutory or charter provisions governing special assessments in the public corporation to the extent applicable. The special assessment proceedings may be initiated by resolution of the governing body of the public corporation without petition, after compliance with section 538a, and a petition or written objection in opposition to the levying of special assessments shall be advisory only and shall not require a petition for the project, except as otherwise provided in section 538a. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   After determining by resolution to proceed, the legislative body shall cause a special assessment roll to be prepared. After the special assessment roll is prepared, the proceedings with respect to the special assessment roll and the making and collection of the special assessments shall be conducted pursuant to the statute or charter governing special assessments in the public corporation. However, the total assessment may be divided into not more than 30 installments, and a person assessed, at the hearing upon the special assessment roll, may object to the special assessment district previously established by the public corporation. Due consideration shall be given to the objections. A hearing held under this section shall not take the place of a meeting required under section 538a unless notice is prepared and mailed in the manner prescribed by section 538a. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a special assessment is levied, all collections from the special assessment shall be used towards the payment of the assessment at large against the public corporation. Each annual levy made for the payment of the assessment at large shall be reduced by the amount of money then on hand from special assessment collections available for this use.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   This section shall not be construed to prevent the assessing of public corporations at large under this chapter. In place of or in addition to levying special assessments, the public corporation, under the same conditions and for the same purpose, may exact connection, readiness to serve, availability, or service charges to be paid by owners of land directly or indirectly connected with the drain project, or combination of projects, subject to section 489a.</DIV>

The treasurer shall also each year, at least 30 days prior to the time of the levying of taxes by each public corporation, notify it of the amount of the installment and interest next becoming due: Provided, That the failure to so notify any public corporation shall not excuse it from making payment of such installment and interest. On or before the due date of any installment, each public corporation shall pay to its county treasurer the full amount thereof together with interest accruing to such due date, and within 15 days thereafter such county treasurer shall forward the amount so paid to the treasurer of the board. If any such public corporation shall fail or neglect to so account to the county treasurer for the amount of any such installment and interest, then the county treasurer shall advance the amount thereof to the treasurer of the board from county funds and deduct the same from any moneys (other than those pledged for the payment of debts) then or thereafter payable by him to such public corporation. The board of supervisors of any county which shall have advanced any money for a public corporation, and which shall not have been reimbursed therefor, may order such public corporation and its officers to levy upon its next tax roll an amount sufficient to make such reimbursement on or before the date when its taxes become delinquent; and it shall be the duty of such public corporation and its tax levying and collecting officials to levy and collect such taxes and to reimburse the county: Provided, That the foregoing shall not prevent the county from obtaining reimbursement by any other legal method. Assessments against the state shall be certified to the state highway commissioner and paid from state highway funds. It shall be the duty of the tax levying officials of each of the other public corporations assessed to levy sufficient taxes to pay assessment installments and interest as the same shall become due unless there shall have been set aside moneys sufficient therefor. If a special assessment roll shall be prepared upon the basis of the estimated cost of the project, then after the actual cost has been ascertained and determined by the board, the special assessments and the installments thereof shall be corrected by adding any deficiency or deducting any excess, or refunding the amount of any prepaid assessment in excess of the assessment based upon actual cost. The board may order such corrections to be made upon the original roll or may order that a new corrected roll be prepared and submitted for approval by the board.</DIV>
