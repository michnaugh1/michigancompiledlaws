<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upon request of the governor, board of regents, board of control or other governing body of any state institution, or other person or persons authorized as aforesaid, it shall be the duty of the attorney general of the state, or when directed by the attorney general, the prosecuting attorney of the county where the land is situated, on behalf of the board of regents, board of control or other governing body, if a body corporate under the law of its creation, and in behalf of the people of the state of Michigan if such governing body is not a body corporate, of any state institution, to cause a petition to be made in the name of the people of the state of Michigan and filed in the proper court, signed by the attorney general, or prosecuting attorney of the county, and by the secretary of such governing board, if a body corporate, and if not a majority of such trustees, board of control or other governing body, or other properly authorized person, as the case may be, addressed to the court setting forth, with reasonable certainty a description of the land sought to be acquired, the names of all persons owning or having an interest therein, so far as disclosed by the records of titles of the county in which the land is situated, or can be ascertained from actual occupants; that the petition is made and presented for the purpose of acquiring the title and ownership of the land described in the petition, to and for the use of the state of Michigan, and specifying generally the purpose for which it is to be used. And the petition shall ask that all persons interested in the premises, or any part thereof, be summoned to appear and answer the petition, and show cause, if any they have, against the same. Upon filing the petition, summons shall issue in accordance with the prayer thereof, against the persons named therein, returnable on a day to be named, which shall not be less than 5 days from the issuing and test thereof, and shall be served at least 3 days before the return day, by the sheriff or other officer authorized to serve process of summons according to the rules and practice of the circuit court in other cases at law. If there are minors or persons of unsound mind interested in the premises, service may be made upon the guardian of any such person or the court may appoint a guardian ad litem for any such person, who may appear and defend for the person he represents. If there are non-resident or absent persons upon whom service cannot be obtained within the county, the court may order service upon any such person wherever he may be found, and in such manner as may be directed. The person serving any such process on such non-resident or absent person shall make proof of service by affidavit, stating the place, time, and manner of service. Or the court may order and cause notice to be given to such absent or non-resident person, by publication in such newspaper printed and published in the county as the court shall designate, and for such length of time as the court may think proper, not less than 3 weeks, once in each week; and any such service out of the county, or notice by publication, shall be as effectual for all the purposes of such proceeding and in the condemnation of the land as though the persons had been personally served within the county.</DIV>

<P>Sec. 3.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   When all the parties named in the petition have been summoned or notified, in the manner provided, and the time for their appearance shall have expired, the court shall hear any and all persons who shall have appeared and interposed objections to the petition or proceedings, and proceed to decide the questions raised, and may vacate the petition, or any part of the proceedings for cause, and may allow amendments of the petition, in form or substance, as the right of the matter shall demand. If any person having an interest in the land has been overlooked, or not summoned or notified, the court may continue the proceedings and cause such person to be served or notified. If the petition and proceedings are sustained, the court shall appoint 3 commissioners, residents and freeholders within the county, not interested or of kin to any of the persons interested in the land to ascertain and determine the necessity of the proposed public use, the necessity for using such property and the just compensation to be paid therefor by the state, which ought to be paid by the state to each of the owners and persons interested in the premises, as and for his, her or their just compensation for the land sought to be taken. Such commissioners before entering upon their duties as such shall take an oath in substantially the following form: "We do each of us solemnly swear that we will faithfully and justly determine the public necessity of the proposed use, the necessity of taking the property described in the petition filed in this cause and the amount of compensation which ought to be paid to each of the owners and persons interested in the premises described in said petition according to our best ability." They shall visit the land sought to be acquired, shall ascertain the separate interest of each person owning or interested in any part of the premises, and the description of his or her separate interest in the parcel; shall hear, in the presence and under direction of the court, evidence touching the matters they are to find, brought forward by any person having an interest, and shall find all necessary facts to possess the court with the truth and right of the matter, but shall not be required to find what evidence was offered or given, and shall report to the court, in writing, their findings. Instead of commissioners, the court, with or without the request of any person interested in any portion of the premises described in the petition, may, and upon the request of any such person shall, order a venire to issue to the sheriff, to summon 12 jurors who shall be residents and freeholders of the county where the land is situated, to attend at a time to be named, before the court, to serve as a jury. Any person interested in any part of the premises may object for cause to any of the jurors, but there shall be no peremptory challenge allowed. In case any juror fails to appear, is excused, or set aside from the panel, the court may order the sheriff, or other proper officer in attendance, to summon forthwith the requisite number of talesmen to form the jury. The jury shall be sworn, as is required of commissioners, and they shall view the premises, hear evidence if offered, determine the necessity of the public use, the necessity for taking such property and the amount of compensation to be paid therefor and the same proceedings be had as near as may be, as hereinbefore required in reference to commissioners.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The court shall hear objections, if any, to the report of the commissioners or jury, as the case may be, and may set aside the report and finding, or confirm the same, and if confirmed, shall enter a judgment of confirmation, and that all right, title and interest of, in, and to the land and premises, vest in the state of Michigan: Provided, That the state, within such time as shall be therein prescribed, shall deposit in the court the amount found by the report of the commissioners or jury, as the just compensation and damages to be paid to the owners and persons interested. If, within the time so prescribed, the state shall cause to be deposited the sum so found, the court shall thereupon enter an order and judgment that the title of the state in and to said land and every part thereof is perfect, and has become absolute, and may issue the necessary writ of assistance, commanding the sheriff to deliver the possession of such land to the state; and thereupon the title and right of the state to such land shall be absolute and binding against all persons whomsoever. The persons owning and interested in said land according to the report and finding aforesaid, shall be entitled, on applying to the court, to be paid on the order of the court the amount or sum to which they are respectively entitled, according to such report or finding; for the sum received they shall respectively give to the clerk their receipt, in writing, to be by the clerk forwarded to the state treasurer. In case the state does not, within the time so prescribed, deposit in court the amount of compensation and damages awarded, the court shall order the proceedings dismissed, and the state take nothing thereby. In the proceedings authorized by this act the court shall, as to the practice and mode of proceedings, be governed by the rules applicable in cases at law, except as is in this act otherwise expressly provided. The expense of the proceedings shall be paid by the state, and a certified copy of the record of the proceedings and judgment of the court shall, together with the record thereof in the office of the register of deeds of the county, be evidence in all courts and places.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Any public corporation or state agency is authorized to take private property necessary for a public improvement or for the purposes of its incorporation or for public use and to institute and prosecute proceedings for that purpose. When funds have been appropriated by the legislature to a state agency, a division of a state agency, the office of the governor, or a division of the office of the governor for the purpose of acquiring lands or property for a designated public use, the unit of a state agency to which the appropriation has been made is authorized on behalf of the people of the state of Michigan to acquire the lands or property either by purchase, condemnation, or otherwise. For the purpose of condemnation, the unit of a state agency may proceed under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The taking of private property by a public corporation or a state agency for transfer to a private entity is not a public use unless the proposed use of the property is invested with public attributes sufficient to fairly deem the entity's activity governmental by 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A public necessity of the extreme sort exists that requires collective action to acquire property for instrumentalities of commerce, including a public utility or a state or federally regulated common carrier, whose very existence depends on the use of property that can be assembled only through the coordination that central government alone is capable of achieving.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The property or use of the property will remain subject to public oversight and accountability after the transfer of the property and will be devoted to the use of the public, independent from the will of the private entity to which the property is transferred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The property is selected on facts of independent public significance or concern, including blight, rather than the private interests of the entity to which the property is eventually transferred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) As used in subsection (1), "public use" does not include the taking of private property for the purpose of transfer to a private entity for either general economic development or the enhancement of tax revenue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In a condemnation action, the burden of proof is on the condemning authority to demonstrate, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the taking of a private property is for a public use, unless the condemnation action involves a taking of private property because the property is blighted, in which case the burden of proof is on the condemning authority to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the taking of that property is for a public use.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If private property consisting of an individual's principal residence is taken for public use, the amount of compensation made and determined for that taking shall be not less than 125% of that property's fair market value, in addition to any other reimbursement allowed by law. In order to be eligible for reimbursement under this subsection, the individual's principal residential structure must be actually taken or the amount of the individual's private property taken leaves less property contiguous to the individual's principal residential structure than the minimum lot size if the local governing unit has implemented a minimum lot size by zoning ordinance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A taking of private property for public use, as allowed under this section, does not include a taking for a public use that is a pretext to confer a private benefit on a known or unknown private entity. For purposes of this subsection, the taking of private property for the purposes of a drain project by a drainage district as allowed under the drain code of 1956, 1956 PA 40, MCL 280.1 to 280.630, does not constitute a pretext to confer a private benefit on a private entity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Any existing right, grant, or benefit afforded to property owners as of December 22, 2006, whether provided by the state constitution of 1963, by this section or other statute, or otherwise, shall be preserved and shall not be abrogated or impaired by the 2006 amendatory acts that added or amended this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this section, "blighted" means property that meets any of the following criteria:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Has been declared a public nuisance in accordance with a local housing, building, plumbing, fire, or other related code or ordinance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Is an attractive nuisance because of physical condition or use.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Is a fire hazard or is otherwise dangerous to the safety of persons or property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Has had the utilities, plumbing, heating, or sewerage disconnected, destroyed, removed, or rendered ineffective for a period of 1 year or more so that the property is unfit for its intended use.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Is tax reverted property owned by a municipality, by a county, or by this state. The sale, lease, or transfer of tax reverted property by a municipality, a county, or this state shall not result in the loss to the property of the status as blighted for purposes of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Is property owned or under the control of a land bank fast track authority under the land bank fast track act, 2003 PA 258, MCL 124.751 to 124.774. The sale, lease, or transfer of the property by a land bank fast track authority shall not result in the loss to the property of the status as blighted for purposes of this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Is improved real property that has remained vacant for 5 consecutive years and that is not maintained in accordance with applicable local housing or property maintenance codes or ordinances.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) Any property that has code violations posing a severe and immediate health or safety threat and that has not been substantially rehabilitated within 1 year after the receipt of notice to rehabilitate from the appropriate code enforcement agency or final determination of any appeal, whichever is later.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   This act provides standards for the acquisition of property by an agency, the conduct of condemnation actions, and the determination of just compensation. It does not confer the power of eminent domain, and does not prescribe or restrict the purposes for which or the persons by whom that power may be exercised. All laws and court rules applicable to civil actions shall apply to condemnation proceedings except as otherwise provided in this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If property is to be acquired by an agency through the exercise of its power of eminent domain, the agency shall commence a condemnation action for that purpose. An agency shall not intentionally make it necessary for an owner of property to commence an action, including an action for constructive taking or de facto taking, to prove the fact of the taking of the property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If a private agency is required by law to secure a certificate of public necessity from the public service commission or other public agency before it may acquire property, the private agency shall not institute judicial proceedings to acquire the property until it has secured the required certificate.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 4.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   If the acquisition of a portion of a parcel of property actually needed by an agency would destroy the practical value or utility of the remainder of that parcel, the agency shall pay just compensation for the whole parcel. The agency may elect whether to receive title and possession of the remainder of the parcel. The question as to whether the practical value or utility of the remainder of the parcel of property is in fact destroyed shall be determined by the court or jury and incorporated in its verdict.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the acquisition of a portion of a parcel of property actually needed by an agency would leave the remainder of the parcel in nonconformity with a zoning ordinance, the agency, before or after acquisition, may apply for a zoning variance for the remainder of the parcel. In determining whether to grant the zoning variance, the governmental entity having jurisdiction to grant the variance shall consider the potential benefits of the public use for which the property would be acquired, in addition to those criteria applicable under the relevant zoning statute, ordinance, or regulation. The agency must actually acquire the portion of the parcel of property for the proposed public use for the zoning variance to become effective for the remainder. If a variance is granted under this subsection, the property shall be considered by the governmental entity to be in conformity with the zoning ordinance for all future uses with respect to the nonconformity for which that variance was granted. However, if the property was also nonconforming for other reasons, the grant of that variance has no effect on the status of those other preexisting nonconformities. An owner shall not increase the nonconformity for which a variance is granted under this section without the consent of the governmental entity. An agency has the same right to appeal action on a zoning variance as would a property owner seeking a zoning variance. This section does not deprive a governmental entity of its discretion to grant or deny a variance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   An agency or an agent or employee of an agency may enter upon property before filing an action for the purpose of making surveys, measurements, examinations, tests, soundings, and borings; taking photographs or samplings; appraising the property; conducting an environmental inspection; conducting archaeological studies pursuant to section 106 of title I of the national historic preservation act, Public Law 89-665, 16 U.S.C. 470f; or determining whether the property is suitable to take for public purposes. The entry may be made upon reasonable notice to the owner and at reasonable hours. An entry made pursuant to this subsection shall not be construed as a taking. The owner or his or her representative shall be given a reasonable opportunity to accompany the agency's agent or employee during the entry upon the property. The agency shall make restitution for actual damage resulting from the entry, which may be recovered by special motion before the court or by separate action if an action for condemnation has not been filed. The term "actual damage" as used in this subsection does not include, and an agency shall not make restitution for, response activity, as defined in section 20101 of part 201 (environmental remediation) of the natural resources and environmental protection act, Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being section 324.20101 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, or diminution in the value or utility of a parcel that is caused by the discovery of information as the result of a survey, an appraisal, a measurement, photography, or an environmental inspection made pursuant to this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If reasonable efforts to enter under subsection (3) have been obstructed or denied, the agency may commence a civil action in the circuit court in the county in which the property or any part of the property is located for an order permitting entry. The complaint shall state the facts making the entry necessary, the date on which entry is sought, and the duration and the method proposed for protecting the defendant against damage. The court may grant a limited license for entry upon such terms as justice and equity require, including the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A description of the purpose of the entry.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The scope of activities that are permitted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The terms and conditions of the entry with respect to the time, place, and manner of the entry.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   An entry made under subsection (3) or (4) shall be made in a manner that minimizes any damage to the property and any hardship, burden, or damage to a person in lawful possession of the property.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   As used in this section, "environmental inspection" means the testing or inspection including the taking of samples of the soil, groundwater, structures, or other materials or substances in, on, or under the property for the purpose of determining whether chemical, bacteriological, radioactive, or other environmental contamination exists and, if it exists, the nature and extent of the contamination.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Before initiating negotiations for the purchase of property, the agency shall establish an amount that it believes to be just compensation for the property and promptly shall submit to the owner a good faith written offer to acquire the property for the full amount so established. At the same time, if the taking of the property might require relocation, the agency shall provide written notice to the occupants of the property stating that an eminent domain proceeding has commenced and outlining the occupants' basic legal rights in the process, including, but not limited to, the fact that any person who has a leasehold interest of less than 6 months is entitled to a $3,500.00 moving allowance as provided under section 2 of 1965 PA 40, MCL 213.352, and that an individual who is a residential occupant may not be displaced until moving expenses or a moving allowance is paid as provided under 1965 PA 40, MCL 213.351 to 213.355, and the person has had a reasonable opportunity, not to exceed 180 days after the payment date of moving expenses or the moving allowance as provided under 1965 PA 40, MCL 213.351 to 213.355, to relocate to a comparable replacement dwelling. If there is more than 1 owner of a parcel, the agency may make a single, unitary good faith written offer. The good faith offer shall state whether the agency reserves or waives its rights to bring federal or state cost recovery actions against the present owner of the property arising out of a release of hazardous substances at the property and the agency's appraisal of just compensation for the property shall reflect such reservation or waiver. The amount shall not be less than the agency's appraisal of just compensation for the property. If the owner fails to provide documents or information as required by subsection (2), the agency may base its good faith written offer on the information otherwise known to the agency whether or not the agency has sought a court order under subsection (2). The agency shall provide the owner of the property and the owner's attorney with an opportunity to review the written appraisal, if an appraisal has been prepared, or if an appraisal has not been prepared, the agency shall provide the owner or the owner's attorney with a written statement and summary, showing the basis for the amount the agency established as just compensation for the property. If an agency is unable to agree with the owner for the purchase of the property, after making a good faith written offer to purchase the property, the agency may file a complaint for the acquisition of the property in the circuit court in the county in which the property is located. If a parcel of property is situated in 2 or more counties and an owner resides in 1 of the counties, the complaint shall be filed in the county in which the owner is a resident. If a parcel of property is situated in 2 or more counties and an owner does not reside in 1 of the counties, the complaint may be filed in any of the counties in which the property is situated. The complaint shall ask that the court ascertain and determine just compensation to be made for the acquisition of the described property. As used in this subsection, "comparable replacement dwelling" means any dwelling that is all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Decent, safe, and sanitary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Adequate in size to accommodate the occupants.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Within the financial means of the individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Functionally equivalent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) In an area not subject to unreasonable adverse environmental conditions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) In a location generally not less desirable than the location of the individual's dwelling with respect to public utilities, facilities, services, and the individual's place of employment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) During the period in which the agency is establishing just compensation for the owner's parcel, the agency has the right to secure tax returns, financial statements, and other relevant financial information for a period not to exceed 5 years before the agency's request. The owner shall produce the information within 21 business days after receipt of a written request from the agency. The agency shall reimburse the owner for actual, reasonable costs incurred in reproducing any requested documents, plus other actual, reasonable costs of not more than $1,000.00 incurred to produce the requested information. Within 45 days after production of the requested documents and other information, the owner shall provide to the agency a detailed invoice for the costs of reproduction and other costs sought. The owner is not entitled to a reimbursement of costs under this subsection if the reimbursement would be duplicative of any other reimbursement to the owner. If the owner fails to provide all documents and other information requested by the agency under this section, the agency may file a complaint and proposed order to show cause in the circuit court in the county specified in subsection (1). The court shall immediately hold a hearing on the agency's proposed order to show cause. The court shall order the owner to provide documents and other information requested by the agency that the court finds to be relevant to a determination of just compensation. An agency shall keep documents and other information that an owner provides to the agency under this section confidential. However, the agency and its experts and representatives may utilize the documents and other information to determine just compensation, may utilize the documents and other information in legal proceedings under this act, and may utilize the documents and other information as provided by court order. If the owner unreasonably fails to timely produce the documents and other information, the owner shall be responsible for all expenses incurred by the agency in obtaining the documents and other information. This section does not affect any right a party may otherwise have to discovery or to require the production of documents and other information upon commencement of an action under this act. A copy of this section shall be provided to the owner with the agency's request.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In determining just compensation, all of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If an owner claims that the agency is taking property other than the property described in the good faith written offer or claims a right to compensation for damage caused by the taking, apart from the value of the property taken, and not described in the good faith written offer, the owner shall file a written claim with the agency stating the nature and substance of that property or damage. The owner's written claim shall provide sufficient information and detail to enable the agency to evaluate the validity of the claim and to determine its value. The owner shall file the claim within 90 days after the good faith written offer is made pursuant to section 5(1) or 180 days after the complaint is served, whichever is later, unless a later date is set by the court for reasonable cause. If the appraisal or written estimate of value is provided within the established period for filing written claims, the owner's appraisal or written estimate of value may serve as the written claim under this act. If the owner fails to timely file the written claim under this subsection, the claim is barred.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The parties shall exchange the agency's updated appraisal reports, if any, and the owner's appraisal report within 90 days after the expiration of the period for filing written claims, unless a later date is set by the court in accordance with section 11(1) for reasonable cause. If the agency believes that the information provided by the owner is not sufficient to allow the evaluation of the claim, the agency may request additional information from the owner and, if that information is not provided, may ask the court to compel the owner to provide additional information to enable the agency to evaluate the validity of the claim and to determine its value. If the owner fails to provide sufficient information after being ordered to do so by the court, the court may assess an appropriate sanction in accordance with the Michigan court rules for failing to comply with discovery orders, including, but not limited to, barring the claim. In addition, the court also shall consider any failure to provide timely information when it determines the maximum reimbursable attorney fees under section 16.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For any claim that has not fully accrued or is continuing in nature when the claim is filed, the owner shall provide information then reasonably available that would enable the agency to evaluate the claim, subject to the owner's continuing duty to supplement that information as it becomes available. The owner shall provide all supplementary information at least 90 days before trial, and the court shall afford the agency a reasonable opportunity for discovery once all supplementary information is provided and allow that discovery to proceed until 30 days before trial. For reasonable cause, the court may extend the time for the owner to provide information to the agency and for the agency to complete discovery. If the owner fails to provide supplementary information as required under this subdivision, the court may assess an appropriate sanction in accordance with the Michigan court rules for failing to comply with discovery orders, including, but not limited to, barring the claim. In addition, the court also shall consider any failure to provide timely supplemental information when it determines the maximum reimbursable attorney fees under section 16.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) After receiving a written claim from an owner, the agency may provide written notice that it contests the compensability of the claim, establish an amount that it believes to be just compensation for the claim, or reject the claim. If the agency establishes an amount it believes to be just compensation for the claim, the agency shall submit a good faith written offer for the claim. The sum of the good faith written offer for all claims submitted under this subsection or otherwise disclosed in discovery for all items of property or damage plus the original good faith written offer constitutes the good faith written offer for purposes of determining the maximum reimbursable attorney fees under section 16. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) If the owner files a claim that is frivolous or in bad faith, the agency is entitled to recover from the owner its actual and reasonable expenses incurred to evaluate the validity and to determine the value of the claim.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A residential tenant's leasehold interest of less than 6 months in the property is not a compensable claim under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In addition to other allegations required or permitted by law, the complaint shall contain or have annexed to it all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A plan showing the property to be taken.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A statement of purpose for which the property is being acquired, and a request for other relief to which the agency is entitled by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The name of each known owner of the property being taken.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A statement setting forth the time within which motions for review under section 6 shall be filed; the amount that will be awarded and the persons to whom the amount will be paid in the event of a default; and the deposit and escrow arrangements made under subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A declaration signed by an authorized official of the agency declaring that the property is being taken by the agency. The declaration shall be recorded with the register of deeds of each county within which the property is situated. The declaration shall include all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A description of the property to be acquired sufficient for its identification and the name of each known owner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) A statement of the estate or interest in the property being taken. Fluid mineral and gas rights and rights of access to and over the highway are excluded from the rights acquired unless the rights are specifically included.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) A statement of the sum of money estimated by the agency to be just compensation for each parcel of property being acquired.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iv) Whether the agency reserves or waives its rights to bring federal or state cost recovery actions against the present owner of the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) When the complaint is filed, the agency shall deposit the amount estimated to be just compensation with a bank, trust company, or title company in the business of handling real estate escrows, or with the state treasurer, municipal treasurer, or county treasurer. The deposit shall be set aside and held for the benefit of the owners, to be disbursed upon order of the court under section 8.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If the property being taken is a principal residence for which an exemption from certain local taxation is granted under section 7cc of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7cc, the agency is obligated to pay an additional amount to the owner or owners, which shall be deposited along with the amount estimated to be just compensation as provided in subsection (5). The additional amount shall be determined by subtracting the taxable value from the state equalized value, multiplying that amount by the total property tax millage rate applicable to the property taken, and multiplying that result by the number of years the owner or owners have owned the principal residence, but not more than 5 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) As used in this section, "taxable value" means that value determined under section 27a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.27a.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 6.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Within the time prescribed to responsively plead after service of a complaint, an owner of the property desiring to challenge the necessity of acquisition of all or part of the property for the purposes stated in the complaint may file a motion in the pending action asking that the necessity be reviewed. The hearing shall be held within 30 days after the filing of the motion.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   With respect to an acquisition by a public agency, the determination of public necessity by that agency is binding on the court in the absence of a showing of fraud, error of law, or abuse of discretion.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, with respect to an acquisition by a private agency, the court at the hearing shall determine the public necessity of the acquisition of the particular parcel. The granting of a permanent or temporary certificate by the public service commission or by a federal agency authorized by federal law to make determinations of public convenience and necessity as to condemnation constitutes a prima facie case that the project in furtherance of which the particular parcel would be acquired is required by the public convenience and necessity. The granting of a certificate of public convenience and necessity by the public service commission pursuant to the electric transmission line certification act, Act No. 30 of the Public Acts of 1995, being sections 460.561 to 460.575 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, is binding on the court.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The court shall render a decision within 60 days after the date on which the hearing is first scheduled.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The court's determination of a motion to review necessity is a final judgment.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Notwithstanding section 309 of the revised judicature act of 1961, Act No. 236 of the Public Acts of 1961, being section 600.309 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, an order of the court upholding or determining public necessity or upholding the validity of the condemnation proceeding is appealable to the court of appeals only by leave of that court pursuant to the general court rules. In the absence of a timely filed appeal of the order, an appeal shall not be granted and the order is not appealable as part of an appeal from a judgment as to just compensation.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   The property is a single family residence and has been used solely for residential purposes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The property is "agricultural property" as defined in section 20101 of part 201 (environmental remediation) of the natural resources and environmental protection act, Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being section 324.20101 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, and the reservation of rights arises out of a release of hazardous substances caused by the application of a fertilizer, soil conditioner, agronomically applied manure, or a pesticide or a combination of these substances according to label directions and according to generally accepted agricultural and management practices, as defined by the Michigan right to farm act, Act No. 93 of the Public Acts of 1981, being sections 286.471 to 286.474 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), if a motion for review under section 6 is not filed or is denied and the right to appeal has terminated or if interim possession is granted under section 9, the court shall order the escrowee to pay the money deposited under section 5 for or on account of the just compensation that may be awarded under section 13. Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), if a motion for review under section 6 is not filed, the court shall, within 30 days, order the escrowee to pay the money deposited under section 5 for or on account of the just compensation that may be awarded under section 13. Upon the motion of any party, the court shall apportion the estimated compensation among the claimants to the compensation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except as provided in subsection (5), if the agency reserves its rights to bring a state or federal cost recovery claim against an owner, under circumstances that the court considers just, the court may allow any portion of the money deposited under section 5 to remain in escrow as security for remediation costs of environmental contamination on the condemned parcel. An agency shall present an affidavit and environmental report establishing that the funds placed on deposit under section 5 are likely to be required to remediate the property. The amount in escrow shall not exceed the likely costs of remediation if the property were used for its highest and best use. This subsection does not limit or expand an owner's or agency's rights to bring federal or state cost recovery claims.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Notwithstanding any order entered by the court requiring money deposited pursuant to section 5 to remain in escrow for the payment of estimated remediation costs of contaminated property, the funds in escrow, plus interest subject to section 15, shall be released among the claimants to the just compensation under circumstances that the court considers just, including any of the following circumstances:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The court finds that the applicable statutory requirements for remediation have changed and the amount remaining in escrow is no longer required in full or in part to remediate the alleged environmental contamination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The court finds that the anticipated need for the remediation of the alleged environmental contamination is not required or is not required to the extent of the funds remaining on deposit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the remediation of the property is not initiated by the agency within 2 years of surrender of possession pursuant to section 9 and the agency is unable to show good cause for delay.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The costs actually expended for remediation are less than the estimated costs of remediation or less than the amount of money remaining in escrow.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A court issues an order of apportionment of remediation responsibility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the court orders the agency to reverse its election under section 6a(1), the court shall order the escrowee to pay the amount of the revised good faith written offer for or on account of the just compensation that may be awarded pursuant to section 13, and to pay the balance of the escrow to the agency. If the agency seeks possession before the court decides whether to reverse the agency's election or before submitting a revised good faith offer, the agency may request that the court order a portion of the escrow withheld in anticipation of a reduction in the revised good faith offer, with the balance to be paid by the escrowee for or on account of the just compensation that may be awarded pursuant to section 13. If the court denies the request to reverse the agency's election or when the revised good faith offer is submitted, the court shall order the escrowee to pay any unpaid portion of it for or on account of the owner and to pay any balance to the agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply to money deposited under section 5 in escrow for the payment of just compensation for an owner's principal residence, if the principal residential structure is actually taken or the amount of the property taken leaves less property contiguous to the principal residential structure than the minimum lot size if the local governing unit has implemented a minimum lot size by zoning ordinance. This subsection does not limit or expand an owner's or agency's rights to bring federal or state cost recovery claims. As used in this subsection, "principal residence" means a principal residence for which an exemption from certain local taxation is granted under section 7cc of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7cc.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a motion for review under section 6 is not filed, upon expiration of the time for filing the motion for review, or, if a motion for review is filed, upon final determination of the motion, the court shall fix the time and terms for surrender of possession of the property to the agency and enforce surrender by appropriate order or other process. The court also may require surrender of possession of the property after the motion for review filed under section 6 has been heard, determined and denied by the circuit court, but before a final determination on appeal, if the agency demonstrates a reasonable need.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If interim possession is granted to a private agency, the court, upon motion of the owner, may order the private agency to file an indemnity bond in an amount determined by the court as necessary to adequately secure just compensation to the owner for the property taken.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If an order granting interim possession is entered, an appeal from the order or any other part of the proceedings shall not act as a stay of the possession order. An agency is liable for damages caused by the possession if its right to possession is denied by the trial court or on appeal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Repayment of all sums advanced shall be a condition precedent to entry of a final order setting aside a determination of public necessity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Although the court shall not order possession to be surrendered to the agency before it orders that the escrow be distributed under section 8(1) or (4) or retained under section 8(2), the court shall not delay or deny surrender of possession because of any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A motion filed pursuant to section 6a, challenging the agency's decision to reserve its rights to bring federal or state cost recovery actions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A motion challenging the agency's escrow under section 8.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) An allegation that the agency should have offered a higher amount for the property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) An allegation that the agency should have included additional property in its good faith written offer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Any other reason except a challenge to the necessity of the acquisition filed under section 6.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The payment of escrow, as ordered under subsection (5), must be made no later than 30 days before physical dispossession. If there is a dispute after the payment is made, the dispute shall be resolved at an apportionment hearing held before physical dispossession.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The following special provisions apply if the surrender of possession of property pursuant to the transfer of title to the property in condemnation proceedings requires the relocation of the owner or another occupant:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the surrender or possession of property requires the relocation of any individual who occupies a residential dwelling on the property, the individual shall not be required to move from his or her dwelling unless he or she has had a reasonable opportunity not to exceed 180 days after the payment date of moving expenses or the moving allowance provided under 1965 PA 40, MCL 213.351 to 213.355, to relocate to a comparable replacement dwelling.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) However, if the agency is complying with applicable federal regulations and procedures regarding payment of compensation or relocation requirements, those federal regulations and procedures take precedence over any conflicting provisions in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this section, "comparable replacement dwelling" means any dwelling that is all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Decent, safe, and sanitary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Adequate in size to accommodate the occupants.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Within the financial means of the individual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Functionally equivalent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) In an area not subject to unreasonable adverse environmental conditions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) In a location generally not less desirable than the location of the individual's dwelling with respect to public utilities, facilities, services, and the individual's place of employment.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   An appraisal report provided pursuant to this section shall fairly and reasonably describe the methodology and basis for the amount of the appraisal.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as provided in this section, an ordinary or expert witness in a proceeding under this act shall receive from the agency the reasonable fees and compensation provided by law for similar services in ordinary civil actions in circuit court, including the reasonable expenses for preparation and trial.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the property owner, by motion to review necessity or otherwise, successfully challenges the agency's right to acquire the property, or the legal sufficiency of the proceedings, and the court finds the proposed acquisition improper, the court shall order the agency to reimburse the owner for actual reasonable attorney fees and other expenses incurred in defending against the improper acquisition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the amount finally determined to be just compensation for the property acquired exceeds the amount of the good faith written offer under section 5, the court shall order reimbursement in whole or in part to the owner by the agency of the owner's reasonable attorney's fees, but not in excess of 1/3 of the amount by which the ultimate award exceeds the agency's written offer as defined by section 5. The reasonableness of the owner's attorney fees shall be determined by the court. If the agency or owner is ordered to pay attorney fees as sanctions under MCR 2.403 or 2.405, those attorney fee sanctions shall be paid to the court as court costs and shall not be paid to the opposing party unless the parties agree otherwise.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the agency settles a case before entry of a verdict or judgment, it may stipulate to pay reasonable attorney and expert witness fees.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Expert witness fees provided for in this section shall be allowed with respect to an expert whose services were reasonably necessary to allow the owner to prepare for trial. For the purpose of this section, for each element of compensation, each party is limited to 1 expert witness to testify on that element of compensation unless, upon showing of good cause, the court permits additional experts. The agency's liability for expert witness fees shall not be diminished or affected by the failure of the owner to call an expert as a witness if the failure is caused by settlement or other disposition of the case or issue with which the expert is concerned.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Except as provided in subsection (7), an agency is not required to reimburse attorney or expert witness fees attributable to an unsuccessful challenge to necessity or to the validity of the proceedings.</div>

This subsection does not affect the right of an indigent person who successfully challenges the agency's right to acquire the property to recover attorney fees, ordinary or expert witness fees, and other expenses incurred in defending against the improper acquisition, as authorized by subsections (1) to (5). As used in this subsection, "indigent person" means an individual whose annual income is at or below 200% of the federal poverty guidelines published by the United States department of health and human services.

If the construction is not completed in substantial compliance with the plan upon which the agency based its claim of enhancement benefits, the owner may reopen the question of compensation within 1 year after the termination of construction. If the construction is not in substantial compliance, the owner is entitled to the difference between the value of the property as affected by the actual construction and the value of the property as it would have been, had construction been completed according to plan. The owner shall not recover more compensation than would have been payable if there was not a claim of enhancement benefits.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Upon demand of the owner before trial, the court may require the agency to acquire that portion of the remainder of the tract which the agency claims to be enhanced if the agency claims enhancement. This subsection shall not apply if the agency withdraws its claim of enhancement benefits before trial.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   The agency has the burden of proof with respect to the existence of enhancement benefits.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Within 1 year after the confirmation of the verdict of the jury or after the judgment of confirmation shall on appeal be confirmed, the common council shall set apart and cause to be provided in the treasury, unless already provided, the amount required to make compensation to the owners and persons interested for the absolute title in fee to the private property taken as awarded by the jury, and shall, in the resolution setting apart and providing said sum, if not already provided, direct the city treasurer to pay to the persons respectively entitled to the money so set apart and provided, to each his or her proportion, as ascertained and awarded by said verdict. And it shall be the duty of the treasurer to securely hold such money in the treasury for the purpose of paying for the property taken, and pay the same to the persons entitled thereto, according to the verdict of the jury, on demand, and not pay out the money for any other purpose whatever.

Whenever the amount of such compensation is in the treasury and this secured to be paid, the city may enter upon and take possession of and use such private property and said city, its successors and assigns shall be seized and possessed of the absolute title in fee to the property so taken. In case of resistance or refusal on the part of any one to the common council or its agents and servants entering upon and taking possession of such private property for the use and purpose for which it is taken, at any time, after the amount of the compensation aforesaid is actually in the treasury, ready to be paid to those entitled thereto, the common council, by the city attorney, corporation counsel or other law officer of the city, may apply to the court, and shall be entitled, on making a sufficient showing, to a writ of assistance to put them in possession of the property: Provided always, That when the money awarded by the jury for just compensation for the taking of any such public utility shall have been paid into the city treasury as above provided, or the payment thereof secured to the satisfaction of the court, after due notice to all concerned, then the petitioners shall be entitled to enter into and take possession of any such public utility and to have the writ of assistance of need to, notwithstanding the pendency of an appeal to the supreme court.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In the event the board or commissioner shall for any reason be disqualified to hear and determine the matter of necessity, as provided in this act, such matter of necessity only shall be heard by a circuit court commissioner of the county in which the property sought to be condemned is located or by a circuit court commissioner acting in such county, as provided by law, and in case any disqualification shall be alleged against any board or commissioner before or during such hearing on necessity, such board or commissioner if they deem such allegation well-founded, may call upon a circuit court commissioner, qualified as hereinbefore provided, to hear the matter and make the determination herein prescribed, and on the day set for hearing a continuance for such purpose to a day certain, may be had if necessary. Upon the day fixed by the notice or the day certain set by such continuance, or upon such other date as said matter may be continued to, such circuit court commissioner shall hear the issue of necessity involved. Any determination on the matter of necessity made hereunder by a circuit court commissioner shall have the same force and effect and shall be filed with and acted upon by the board or commissioner in the same manner and be subject to all the provisions of this act, as are determinations made by such board or commissioner.</DIV>
