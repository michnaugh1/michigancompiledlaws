<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A municipality shall approve or disapprove a proposed division within 45 days after the filing of a complete application for the proposed division with the assessor or other municipally designated official. However, a municipality with a population of 2,500 or less may enter into an agreement with a county to transfer to the county authority to approve or disapprove a division. An application is complete if it contains information necessary to ascertain whether the requirements of section 108 and this section are met. The assessor or other municipally designated official, or the county official, having authority to approve or disapprove a proposed division, shall provide the person who filed the application written notice whether the application is approved or disapproved and, if disapproved, all the reasons for disapproval. A complete application for a proposed division shall be approved if, in addition to the requirements of section 108, all of the following requirements are met:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Each resulting parcel has an adequate and accurate legal description and is included in a tentative parcel map showing area, parcel lines, public utility easements, accessibility, and other requirements of this section and section 108. The tentative parcel map shall be a scale drawing showing the approximate dimensions of the parcels.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Each resulting parcel has a depth of not more than 4 times the width or, if an ordinance referred to in subsection (5) requires a smaller depth to width ratio, a depth to width ratio as required by the ordinance. The municipality or county having authority to review proposed divisions may allow a greater depth to width ratio than that otherwise required by this subdivision or an ordinance referred to in subsection (5). The greater depth to width ratio shall be based on standards set forth in the ordinance referred to in subsection (5). The standards may include, but need not be limited to, exceptional topographic or physical conditions with respect to the parcel and compatibility with surrounding lands. The depth to width ratio requirements of this subdivision do not apply to a parcel larger than 10 acres, unless an ordinance referred to in subsection (5) provides otherwise, and do not apply to the remainder of the parent parcel or parent tract retained by the proprietor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Each resulting parcel has a width not less than that required by an ordinance referred to in subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Each resulting parcel has an area not less than that required by an ordinance referred to in subsection (5).</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) The division does not isolate a cemetery so that it does not meet the requirements of either section 102(j)(i) or (ii).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) One of the following are satisfied:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) All property taxes and special assessments due on the parcel or tract subject to the proposed division for the 5 years preceding the date of the application have been paid, as established by a certificate from the county treasurer of the county in which the parcel or tract is located. If the date of the application is on or after March 1 and before the local treasurer of the local tax collecting unit in which the parcel or tract is located has made his or her return of current delinquent taxes, the county treasurer shall include with his or her certification a notation that the return of current delinquent taxes was not available for examination. The official having authority to approve or disapprove the application shall not disapprove the application because the county treasurer's certification includes such a notation. The county treasurer shall collect a fee for a certification under this subdivision in an amount equal to the fee payable under section 1(2) of 1895 PA 161, MCL 48.101, for a certificate relating to the payment of taxes under section 135 of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.135.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) If property taxes or special assessments due on the parcel or tract subject to the proposed division have not been paid, the unpaid property taxes or special assessments have been apportioned by the township or city assessing officer as provided by section 53 of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.53. Any apportioned property taxes or special assessments are a lien against the parcels or tracts as apportioned by the assessing officer and shall be treated in the same manner as property taxes and special assessments of the year of the original assessment for the purpose of collection and sale for delinquent taxes under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The right to make divisions exempt from the platting requirements of this act under section 108 and this section can be transferred, but only from a parent parcel or parent tract to a parcel created from that parent parcel or parent tract. A proprietor transferring the right to make a division pursuant to this subsection shall within 45 days give written notice of the transfer to the assessor of the city or township where the property is located on a form prescribed by the state tax commission. The form shall include substantially the following questions in the mandatory information portion of the form:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Did the parent parcel or parent tract have any unallocated divisions under the land division act, 1967 PA 288, MCL 560.101 to 560.293?" </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Were any unallocated divisions transferred to the newly created parcel? If so, state whether all were transferred or, if not, how many?"</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A person shall not sell a parcel of unplatted land unless the deed contains a statement as to whether the right to make further divisions exempt from the platting requirements of this act under this section and section 108 is proposed to be conveyed. The statement shall be in substantially the following form: "The grantor grants to the grantee the right to make [insert "zero", a number, or "all"] division(s) under section 108 of the land division act, 1967 PA 288, MCL 560.108.". In the absence of a statement conforming to the requirements of this subsection, the right to make divisions under section 108(2), (3), and (4) stays with the remainder of the parent tract or parent parcel retained by the grantor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) All deeds for parcels of unplatted land within this state executed after March 31, 1997 shall contain the following statement: "This property may be located within the vicinity of farm land or a farm operation. Generally accepted agricultural and management practices which may generate noise, dust, odors, and other associated conditions may be used and are protected by the Michigan right to farm act.".</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The governing body of a municipality or the county board of commissioners of a county having authority to approve or disapprove a division may adopt an ordinance setting forth the standards authorized in subsection (1)(b), (c), and (d). The ordinance may establish a fee for a review of an application under this section and section 108. The fee shall not exceed the reasonable costs of providing the services for which the fee is charged.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Approval of a division is not a determination that the resulting parcels comply with other ordinances or regulations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Compliance with this section is not a requirement for a deed to be received for record or recorded by a register of deeds.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   When an assessor's plat is recorded, the register of deeds shall notify the county treasurer. The county treasurer shall notify the assessor if any part of the lands included in the plat are delinquent for taxes or special assessments for any year prior to the date of recording.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Reference to any land, as it appears on a recorded assessor's plat is sufficient for purposes of assessment and taxation.

The plat or record thereof shall be received in evidence in all courts and places as correctly describing the several parcels of land therein designated. After an assessor's plat has been made and recorded with the register of deeds, all conveyances of lands included in the assessor's plat shall be by reference to the plat.

</P>
<P>Sec. 226.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Upon trial and hearing of the action, the court may order a recorded plat or any part of it to be vacated, corrected, or revised, with the following exceptions:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A part of a state highway or federal aid road shall not be vacated, corrected, or revised except by the state transportation department.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A part of a county road shall not be vacated, corrected, or revised except by the county road commission having jurisdiction pursuant to chapter IV of Act No. 283 of the Public Acts of 1909, being sections 224.1 to 224.32 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A part of a street or alley under the jurisdiction of a city, village, or township and a part of any public walkway, park, or public square or any other land dedicated to the public for purposes other than pedestrian or vehicular travel shall not be vacated, corrected, or revised under this section except by both a resolution or other legislative enactment duly adopted by the governing body of the municipality and by court order. However, neither this section nor any other section shall limit or restrict the right of a municipality under sections 256 and 257 to vacate the whole or any part of a street, alley, or other land dedicated to the use of the public. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If a circuit court determines pursuant to this act that a recorded plat or any part of it that contains a public highway or portion of a public highway that borders on, crosses, is adjacent to, or ends at any lake or the general course of any stream, should be vacated or altered in a manner that would result in a loss of public access, it shall allow the state and, if the subdivision is located in a township, the township to decide whether it wants to maintain the property as an ingress and egress point. If the state or township decides to maintain the property, the court shall order the official or officials to either relinquish control to the state or township if the interest is nontransferable or convey by quitclaim deed whatever interest in the property that is held by the local unit of government to the state or township. The township shall have first priority to obtain the property or control of the property as an ingress and egress point. If the township obtains the property or control of the property as an ingress and egress point and later proposes to transfer the property or control of the property, it shall give the department of natural resources first priority to obtain the property or control of the property. If the state obtains the property or control of the property under this subsection, the property shall be under the jurisdiction of the department of natural resources. The state may retain title to the property, transfer title to a local unit of government, or deed the property to the adjacent property owners. If the property was purchased from restricted fund revenue, money obtained from sale of the property shall be returned to that restricted fund.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A judgment under this section vacating, correcting, or revising a highway, road, street, or other land dedicated to the public and being used by a public utility for public utility purposes shall reserve an easement therein for the use of public utilities, and may reserve an easement in other cases.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If interest in the property is conveyed or control over the property is relinquished to a local unit or this state under subsection (2), the local unit or this state, as applicable, shall operate and maintain the property so as to prevent and eliminate garbage and litter accumulation, unsanitary conditions, undue noise, and congestion as necessary.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If a person shows substantial noncompliance with the requirements of subsection (4), the circuit court may order the local unit or this state to close the road ending in a manner to prevent ingress and egress to the body of water for a period of up to 30 days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If a person shows substantial noncompliance with the requirements of subsection (4) and the circuit court has previously closed the road ending for up to 30 days under subsection (5), the circuit court may order the local unit or this state to close the road ending in a manner to prevent ingress and egress to the body of water for 90 days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   If a person shows substantial noncompliance with the requirements of subsection (4) and the circuit court has previously closed the road ending for 90 days under subsection (6), the circuit court may order the local unit or this state to close the road ending in a manner to prevent ingress and egress to the body of water for 180 days.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   If a person shows substantial noncompliance with the requirements of subsection (4) and the circuit court has previously closed the road ending for 180 days under subsection (7), the circuit court shall order the local unit or this state to show cause why the road ending should not be permanently closed in a manner to prevent ingress and egress to the body of water. Subject to subsection (9), the circuit court shall permanently close the road ending unless the local unit or this state shows cause why the road ending should not be closed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   After a road ending is closed under subsection (8), and unless the property has been conveyed or relinquished to the adjacent landowners under subsection (10), the local unit or this state may petition the circuit court to reopen the road ending. The circuit court may order the road ending reopened if the local unit or this state presents a management plan to and posts a performance bond with the circuit court, and the circuit court finds that the management plan and performance bond are adequate to ensure compliance with subsection (4).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   After a road ending is closed by the circuit court under subsection (8), 1 or more of the adjacent landowners may petition the circuit court to order the local unit or this state to convey any interest in the property that the local unit or this state holds to the adjacent landowners, or, if the interest is nontransferable, to relinquish control over the property to the adjacent landowners.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   Proceedings under subsection (5), (6), (7), or (8) shall be initiated by application of 7 owners of record title of land in the local unit who own land within 1 mile of the road ending to the circuit court for the county in which the road ending is located. The applicants in proceedings under subsection (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), or (10) shall give the persons described in section 224a notice of the application by registered mail.</DIV>
