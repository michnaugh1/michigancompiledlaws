<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) As soon as practicable after the board of state canvassers has, by the official canvass, ascertained the result of an election as to the electors of President and Vice President of the United States, but not less than 6 days before the date on which the electors for President and Vice President of the United States are to convene under section 47, the governor shall issue a certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors that does all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Sets forth the names of the electors appointed and the canvass or other determination under the laws of this state of the number of votes given or cast for each individual whose appointment any or all votes have been given or cast.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Bears the seal of this state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Contains at least 1 security feature, as determined by the governor, for the purpose of verifying the authenticity of the certificate. The secure components of any security feature used are confidential and not subject to disclosure under the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Immediately after issuing the certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors under subsection (1), the governor shall transmit to the Archivist of the United States, by the most expeditious method available, the certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors. The governor shall also transmit to each elector chosen as an elector for President and Vice President of the United States, on or before the date on which the electors are to convene under section 47, 6 duplicate-originals of the certificate. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Subject to this subsection, the fact that a recount petition has been filed, or that a recount is pending, has no effect on the governor's authority or responsibility to issue a certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors as required under subsection (1). However, if a mandatory recount of all precincts in this state is required under section 880a, the governor shall not issue the certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors required under subsection (1) until the completion and certification of the recount or until 3 p.m. on the sixth day before the date on which the electors for President and Vice President of the United States are to convene under section 47, whichever occurs first. If the recount is completed and certified before 3 p.m. on the sixth day before the date on which the electors for President and Vice President of the United States are to convene under section 47, the certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors issued by the governor must reflect the certified result of that recount. If the recount is not completed and certified before 3 p.m. on the sixth day before the date on which the electors for President and Vice President of the United States are to convene under section 47, the certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors issued by the governor must reflect the original certification of the results of the election.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If a recount is completed by 11:59 p.m. on the second day before the date on which the electors for President and Vice President of the United States are to convene under section 47, and the result of that recount, as certified by the board of state canvassers, alters the winner of the presidential election as reflected on the certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors issued by the governor under subsection (1), an affected candidate for President or Vice President of the United States may have the certification reviewed by the supreme court, or may seek other judicial relief from the supreme court related to the certification including, but not limited to, an order directing the governor to issue a superseding certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors that reflects the updated and certified results of the presidential election. An action under this subsection must be filed with the supreme court within 24 hours after the certification of the completed recount. A plaintiff filing an action in the supreme court under this subsection must request an expedited hearing and that the supreme court issue an order granting any judicial relief by 4 p.m. on the day before the date on which the electors for President and Vice President of the United States are to convene under section 47. If the supreme court issues an order by the day before the date on which the electors are to convene under section 47 that requires the governor to issue a superseding certificate of ascertainment consistent with the certified results of the recount, the governor must issue that superseding certificate of ascertainment before the date on which the electors are to convene under section 47.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a recount is completed by 11:59 p.m. on the second day before the date on which the electors for President and Vice President of the United States are to convene under section 47, and the result of that recount, as certified by the board of state canvassers, alters the winner of the presidential election as reflected on the certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors issued by the governor under subsection (1), and the supreme court does not issue an order under subsection (4) before 4 p.m. on the day before the date on which the electors are to convene under section 47, the governor must issue a superseding certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors that reflects the updated and certified results of the presidential election, as determined by the recount and certified by the board of state canvassers, no later than 11:59 p.m. on the day before the date on which the electors are to convene under section 47.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A superseding certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors issued by the governor under this section replaces and supersedes any prior certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors issued under this section, must be transmitted consistent with the requirements under subsection (2) for the certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors, and is conclusive with respect to the determination of electors for President and Vice President of the United States appointed by this state. </div>

At any time before receiving the certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors from the governor or within 48 hours thereafter, an elector may resign by submitting the elector's written and verified resignation to the governor. Failure to resign signifies consent to serve and to cast the elector's vote for the candidates for President and Vice President appearing on the Michigan ballot of the political party that nominated the elector. Refusal or failure to vote for the candidates for President and Vice President appearing on the Michigan ballot of the political party that nominated the elector constitutes a resignation from the office of elector, the elector's vote must not be recorded, and the remaining electors must forthwith fill the vacancy. The ballot used by the elector must bear the name of the elector. If at the time of convening there is any vacancy caused by death, resignation, refusal or failure to vote, neglect to attend, or ineligibility of any individual elected, or for any other cause, the qualified electors of President and Vice President shall proceed to fill the vacancy by ballot, by a plurality of votes. When all the electors appear and the vacancy is filled, the electors shall proceed to perform the duties of the electors, as required by the constitution and laws of the United States. If Congress hereafter fixes a different day for the meeting, the electors shall meet and give the electors votes on the day designated by the act of Congress.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 358.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   In every township, there shall be a general November election in each even-numbered year for the election of officers and the submission of propositions, as provided by law. At the 1980 general November election, there shall be elected by ballot all of the following township officers: </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A supervisor. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   A clerk. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   A treasurer. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   Two trustees. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Not more than 4 constables. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   If authorized by law and after a township takes the actions provided in section 11 of 1877 PA 164, MCL 397.211, 6 free public library directors. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   If a township takes the actions provided in section 1 of former 1931 PA 271 or section 6 of 1905 PA 157, MCL 41.426, the number of park commission members provided for under section 6 of 1905 PA 157, MCL 41.426.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the order of offices on the township portion of the ballots shall be the same as the order in which the officers are listed in subsection (1). Free public library directors shall be listed on the nonpartisan portion of the ballot.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Subject to the limitation in subsection (1), the number of constables to be elected at the 1992 general November election and each general November election at which township offices are regularly to be elected after 1992 shall be determined by the township board by resolution not less than 6 months before the township primary election preceding the general November election. The resolution that specifies the number of constables to be elected applies in that township until a subsequent resolution is adopted altering that number. If a determination as to the number of constables to be elected is not made by the township board by the deadline under this subsection for the 1992 general election, the number of constables to be elected shall be the same number that was elected in that township in the 1988 general November election until a resolution is adopted to provide for the election of a different number of constables.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In a township having a population of 5,000 or more, or having 3,000 or more qualified and registered electors as shown by the registration records at the close of registration for the last preceding general November election, there may be elected 4 trustees. In other townships there shall be 2 trustees. A township shall not elect 4 trustees unless the election of additional trustees is approved by the voters at a general November election or by a majority of the voters attending at an annual meeting. The township board of a township having a population of 5,000 or more, or having 3,000 or more qualified and registered electors, shall cause the question of electing additional trustees to be voted on at the first general November election or annual meeting following the township's qualifying for additional trustees. If a majority of the electors voting on the question vote in favor of electing 4 trustees, the township shall thereafter elect 4 trustees. If a majority of the electors voting on the question do not vote in favor of electing 4 trustees, the township board may resubmit the question at a subsequent general November election or annual meeting or the question shall be submitted at the first general November election or annual meeting held not less than 84 days following the submission of a petition containing the signatures of not less than 10% of the registered and qualified electors of the township, as shown by the registration records at the close of registration for the last general November election, asking that the question be submitted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   At the first general November election in a township held not less than 4 months after the provisions of this section relative to additional trustees are adopted by a township, there shall be elected the number of trustees necessary to make a total of 4 trustees. If the additional trustees are elected at a general November election that is not a regular township election, the additional trustees shall hold office only until a successor is elected at the next regular township election and qualifies for office.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   This section does not prohibit townships electing 4 trustees as of September 13, 1958 from continuing to do so.</DIV>

A person who files nominating petitions for election to more than 1 court of appeals judgeship has not more than 3 days following the close of filing to withdraw from all but 1 filing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In a primary and general election for 2 or more judgeships where more than 1 of the categories in subsection (2) could be selected, a candidate shall apply to the bureau of elections for a written statement of office designation to correspond to the judgeship sought by the candidate.

Nominating petitions containing an improper office designation are invalid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The secretary of state shall issue an office designation of incumbent position for any judgeship for which the incumbent judge is eligible to seek reelection. If an incumbent judge does not file an affidavit of candidacy by the deadline, the secretary of state shall notify all candidates for that office that a nonincumbent position exists. All nominating petitions circulated for the nonincumbent position subsequent to the deadline must bear an office designation of nonincumbent position.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An incumbent judge of the court of appeals may become a candidate in the primary election for the office of which he or she is the incumbent by filing with the secretary of state an affidavit of candidacy not less than 134 days before the date of the primary election. However, if an incumbent judge of the court of appeals was appointed to fill a vacancy and the judge entered upon the duties of the office less than 137 days before the date of the primary election but before the fifteenth Tuesday before the primary election, the incumbent judge may file the affidavit of candidacy not more than 3 days after entering upon the duties of office.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) If a court grants equitable relief to a candidate under subsection (6), the candidate must be given the opportunity to obtain additional nominating petition signatures to meet the requirements under section 544f. The additional nominating petition signatures obtained by a candidate must be filed with the secretary of state no later than 4 p.m. on the fifth business day after the date that the court order granting equitable relief is filed.</div>

If the board is unable to verify the genuineness of a signature on a petition using the digitized signature contained in the qualified voter file, the board may cause any doubtful signatures to be checked against the registration records by the clerk of any political subdivision in which the petitions were circulated, to determine the authenticity of the signatures or to verify the registrations.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If an individual returns a notice mailed under subsection (2) and declines the voter registration, that individual is considered to never have been registered to vote and any information added to the qualified voter file for that individual must be removed. However, if an individual has voted in an election and then returns a notice mailed under subsection (2) that declines the voter registration, the secretary of state's office shall contact that individual to determine whether the individual wishes to decline the voter registration or remain registered to vote.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a notice mailed under subsection (2) is returned to the secretary of state by the post office as undeliverable, the qualified voter file must generate a notification to the clerk of the city or township in which that individual resides to have the clerk mail the individual a notice required under section 509aa(3). If an individual returns a notice mailed under subsection (2) without selecting the option to decline the voter registration, the individual remains registered to vote.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The secretary of state shall not provide an opportunity to register to vote or automatically register to vote any individual who, when submitting an application under subsection (1), provides documentation demonstrating that the individual is not a United States citizen. Subject to this subsection, for any other individual who submits an application under subsection (1) who has not provided documentation demonstrating United States citizenship, but who is of sufficient age to register to vote, the secretary of state shall offer to register to vote that individual if the individual indicates on the individual's operator's or chauffeur's license application, official state personal identification card application, or change of address application that the individual is a citizen of the United States. The secretary of state shall add the information required under section 509q(1)(a), (b), and (g) to the qualified voter file for each elector registered under this subsection and shall electronically forward the name of each elector registered under this subsection to the clerk of the city or township in which each elector resides to have the clerk register that individual to vote. For an individual registered under this subsection, the qualified voter file must include an indication that the individual was registered to vote under this section. For purposes of this subsection only, the secretary of state shall not register to vote an individual under this subsection who indicates on the individual's operator's or chauffeur's license application, official state personal identification card application, or change of address application that the individual declines to use the application as a voter registration application. The secretary of state shall not transmit any information to the qualified voter file regarding any individual who declines under this subsection to use an application described in this section as a voter registration application. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The secretary of state shall use the procedures in subsections (2) to (6) to preregister any individual who meets the qualifications to preregister to vote under section 496a and who submits an application under subsection (1). The procedures in subsections (2) to (5) must be used for each individual who submits an application under subsection (1), or who is issued a graduated licensing status under section 310e of the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.310e, who provides or has provided documentation demonstrating United States citizenship, and who is of sufficient age to preregister to vote. The notice and procedures required in subsections (2) to (5) must be modified to reflect that the individual has been preregistered to vote, not registered to vote. The procedures in subsection (6) must be used for each individual who submits an application under subsection (1) and who has not provided documentation demonstrating United States citizenship, but is of sufficient age to preregister to vote, except that the secretary of state shall not provide an opportunity to preregister to vote or automatically preregister to vote any individual who, at the time of submitting an application under subsection (1), provides documentation demonstrating that the individual is not a United States citizen.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) An individual who is not eligible to vote and who, without intending to register to vote, becomes registered to vote through human or mechanical error is not considered to have knowingly intended to register to vote in violation of section 519.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If an individual who is not eligible to vote becomes registered to vote under subsection (2) or section 493b and votes or attempts to vote in an election held after the effective date of the individual's voter registration, that individual is presumed to have a defense for a violation under section 932a(c). This subsection does not apply to an individual who knowingly and willfully makes a false statement to effectuate voter registration or who intentionally takes voluntary action to register to vote or vote knowing that the individual is not entitled to vote.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Nothing in this section shall be construed to amend the substantive qualifications for voter registration in this state, or to require documentary proof of United States citizenship for voter registration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The secretary of state shall publicly release data reports, as described in this subsection, on a monthly basis. The data reports must not include any personally identifying information, must be subcategorized by sex and age of the individuals included, and must include all of the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The number of individuals registered to vote or preregistered to vote under the procedures in subsections (2) to (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The number of individuals who declined voter registration or voter preregistration under the procedures in subsections (2) to (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The number of individuals registered to vote or preregistered to vote under the procedures in subsection (6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The number of individuals who declined voter registration or voter preregistration under the procedures in subsection (6).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The number of individuals whose voter registration or voter preregistration was updated pursuant to the requirement under sections 509o and 509r that the secretary of state use the residence address provided on a driver license or state personal identification card application as the applicant's residence address in the qualified voter file.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the secretary of state verifies that a state agency in the regular course of business collects sufficient information, including through documents or database verification, to confirm the eligibility for voter registration or the updating of information for an existing voter registration, the secretary of state may designate that state agency as an automatic voter registration agency. Once a state agency is designated as an automatic voter registration agency, that state agency must not be removed as an automatic voter registration agency unless it is shown that the state agency no longer collects sufficient information to confirm the eligibility for voter registration or the updating of information for an existing voter registration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a state agency is designated as an automatic voter registration agency under subsection (1), that state agency and the secretary of state shall jointly establish a procedure and schedule for automatically and electronically transmitting voter registration information from the state agency to the secretary of state for those individuals who are eligible to register to vote or preregister to vote, or to update information in the qualified voter file for those individuals who are already registered to vote or preregistered to vote. Subject to any instructions issued and determined necessary by the secretary of state to conform with a designated state agency transaction, each designated state agency under subsection (1), the secretary of state, and the clerk of each city and township must comply with the procedures under section 493a for automatically registering and preregistering individuals to vote.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If information is received under subsection (2) for an individual who is already registered to vote or preregistered to vote, the secretary of state shall use the most recent information for the residence address or name of the individual received from the state agency to update the individual's information in the qualified voter file. The secretary of state shall send to the individual's new residence address, by forwardable mail, notice of the change and a postage prepaid and preaddressed return form by which the individual may verify or correct the information. If the individual returns the notice and indicates that the change to the individual's record was in error, the secretary of state must immediately revert the individual's updated information in the qualified voter file to the information as it existed before the update.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Subject to compliance with all applicable federal laws and regulations, as part of an application for Medicaid coverage to the department of health and human services, the department of health and human services shall automatically and electronically transmit the information required under section 509q(1)(a), either the information required under section 509q(1)(b) or the last 4 digits of the individual's Social Security number, and the individual's digitized signature, if available, to the secretary of state for each individual who is of sufficient age to register to vote or preregister to vote and who is verified as a United States citizen. Subject to any instructions issued and determined necessary by the secretary of state to conform with the structure of a department of health and human services application, in processing the information received from the department of health and human services under this subsection, the secretary of state and each city or township clerk shall comply with the requirements established under section 493a(2) to (5) and (7) for automatically registering and preregistering individuals to vote, and the requirements established under subsection (3) for updating information for individuals who are already registered to vote or preregistered to vote.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Subject to compliance with all applicable federal laws and regulations, an Indian nation or tribe located in this state may, at its discretion, submit a request to the secretary of state for approval to allow the governing body of the Indian nation or tribe, or an election board, election official, or other designated representative of the Indian nation or tribe, to electronically submit the information required under section 509q(1)(a), either the information required under section 509q(1)(b) or the last 4 digits of the individual's Social Security number, and the individual's digitized signature, if available, for any tribal member to the secretary of state for the purpose of registering and preregistering tribal members to vote or for updating the registration or preregistration information of tribal members. If an Indian nation or tribe submits a request under this subsection and the Indian nation's or tribe's governing body, election board, election official, or other designated representative collects sufficient information, including through documents or database verification, to confirm the eligibility for registration or for updating the information for an existing voter registration, the secretary of state shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Indian nation or tribe regarding transmission and processing of information for purposes of voter registration. Subject to any instructions issued and determined necessary by the secretary of state to conform with Indian nation or tribal procedures, in processing information received under this subsection, the secretary of state and each city or township clerk shall comply with the requirements established under section 493a(2) to (5) and (7) for automatically registering and preregistering individuals to vote, and the requirements established under subsection (3) for updating information for individuals who are already registered to vote or preregistered to vote.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The secretary of state and the department of corrections shall coordinate to ensure that eligible individuals are automatically registered to vote, with the opportunity to decline the voter registration, on release from incarceration imposed as a sentence for a crime. Subject to this subsection, for individuals scheduled to be released on parole, or discharged on completion of the individual's maximum sentence, and who will be issued an operator's or chauffeur's license under the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.1 to 257.923, an official state personal identification card under 1972 PA 222, MCL 28.291 to 28.300, or an enhanced driver license or enhanced official state personal identification card under the enhanced driver license and enhanced official state personal identification card act, 2008 PA 23, MCL 28.301 to 28.308, the secretary of state and the department of corrections shall use the procedures under section 493a(2) to (7) to comply with this subsection. However, an individual must not be registered to vote until the individual's release on parole or discharge on completion of the individual's maximum sentence. The procedures under section 493a(2) to (5) must be used for each individual who submits an application for an operator's or chauffeur's license under the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.1 to 257.923, an official state personal identification card under 1972 PA 222, MCL 28.291 to 28.300, or an enhanced driver license or enhanced official state personal identification card under the enhanced driver license and enhanced official state personal identification card act, 2008 PA 23, MCL 28.301 to 28.308, who provides or has provided documentation demonstrating United States citizenship, and who is of sufficient age to register to vote. The notice and procedures required under section 493a(2) to (5) must be modified to reflect that the individual is not registered to vote until released on parole or discharged on completion of the individual's maximum sentence. Subject to this subsection, the procedures under section 493a(6) must be used for each individual who submits an application for an operator's or chauffeur's license under the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.1 to 257.923, or an official state personal identification card under 1972 PA 222, MCL 28.291 to 28.300, and who has not provided documentation demonstrating United States citizenship but is of sufficient age to register to vote. However, the secretary of state shall not provide an opportunity to register to vote or automatically register to vote any individual who, at the time of submitting an application for an operator's or chauffeur's license under the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.1 to 257.923, or an official state personal identification card under 1972 PA 222, MCL 28.291 to 28.300, provides documentation demonstrating that the individual is not a United States citizen. The secretary of state and the department of corrections shall jointly ensure that an individual is not registered to vote under this subsection until the individual has been released on parole or discharged on completion of the individual's maximum sentence. For any individual who is released from incarceration imposed as a sentence for a crime and who is not otherwise subject to this subsection, the department of corrections and the secretary of state shall, as provided under subsection (2), jointly establish a procedure and schedule for automatically and electronically transmitting voter registration information from the department of corrections to the secretary of state for those individuals who are eligible to register or preregister to vote.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The secretary of state shall develop procedures for processing electronic records received from a state agency designated as an automatic voter registration agency, or from an Indian nation or tribe under this section, that do not include a digitized image of the applicant's signature.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If an individual preregisters to vote at a secretary of state's office or on the department of state's website, the secretary of state shall transmit the electronic data for that individual's application to preregister to vote to the qualified voter file. If an individual preregisters to vote at the city or township clerk's office or by mail, the city or township clerk shall, immediately after receiving the application to preregister to vote, transmit the electronic data for that individual's application to preregister to vote to the qualified voter file.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An individual who is preregistered to vote becomes a registered elector at 17-1/2 years of age and is eligible to vote in the first election that occurs on or after the date the individual becomes 18 years of age. If an individual will be 18 years of age on or before the date of an election, the individual may use any method of voting in that election, including any method of voting that occurs before election day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) At each election, the qualified voter file must include on the precinct voter registration lists, including those precinct voter registration lists used at early voting sites, the names of all registered individuals who will be 18 years of age on or before the date of the election.

The city or township clerk who receives a notification under this subsection must send a voter identification card to the individual who is preregistered to vote and must add that individual to the master file.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The secretary of state and the department of education shall annually coordinate a public education and outreach campaign to ensure that individuals who are at least 16 years of age but less than 18 years of age, and who are eligible to preregister to vote under this section or who are eligible to register to vote under section 492, are informed of the opportunity and available methods to preregister to vote or register to vote. In addition, the department of education shall ensure that materials for voter registration and preregistration to vote are available to pupils in each public high school in this state. As used in this subsection:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Public high school" means a public school that offers at least 1 of grades 9 to 12.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An elector entitled to registration in an election precinct may become registered in the precinct by applying in person and signing the registration application before the clerk or assistant clerk of the township, city, or village in which the precinct is located. For the performance of his or her duties under this act, each clerk and assistant clerk has the power to administer oaths and to swear persons as to the truth of statements contained in an application. For a better examination of the applicant, a clerk may employ and swear an interpreter to interpret all questions put to applicants and the answers to those questions. If the applicant, in answer to a question or in the registration application, makes a material statement that is false, the applicant is guilty of a misdemeanor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A clerk or assistant clerk shall not accept a fee from an elector applying for registration, either for the registering of the elector or for the taking of the acknowledgment on the application. A person who violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The clerk, immediately after receiving the registration or change of address of an elector, shall prepare a voter identification card for the elector. The clerk shall also prepare and send a corrected voter identification card to an elector affected by a change in United States representative, state senatorial, state representative, or county commissioner district or precinct. The clerk shall forward by first-class mail the voter identification card to the elector at the elector's registration address. The voter identification card shall contain the name and address of the registrant and the United States representative, state senatorial, state representative, or county commissioner district and precinct in which the registrant is an elector. If the original voter identification card is returned to the clerk by the post office as nondeliverable, the clerk shall reject the registration and send the individual a notice of rejection. If a duplicate voter identification card is returned to the clerk by the post office, the clerk shall accept this as information that the elector has moved and the clerk shall proceed in conformity with section 509aa.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For an individual who does not present a receipt verifying the acceptance of a voter registration application under subdivision (a), the election inspector shall determine whether the individual is in the appropriate polling place based on residence information provided by the individual. The election inspector shall review any documents or maps in the polling place or communicate with the city or township clerk to verify the appropriate polling place for the individual. The election inspector shall direct an individual who is not in the appropriate polling place to the appropriate polling place. If the individual refuses to go to the appropriate polling place, the election inspector shall issue the individual a provisional ballot that is processed according to subsection (5).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Except for an individual who produces a receipt under subsection (1)(a), the election inspector shall require an individual who is not listed on the voter registration list to execute a sworn statement affirming that the individual submitted a voter registration application on or before election day and is eligible to vote in the election. An individual who provides false information in a signed sworn statement under this subsection is guilty of perjury. An individual signing a sworn statement shall complete a new voter registration application. The individual shall state the approximate date and in what manner the registration application was submitted:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) To a department of state office.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) To a designated voter registration agency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) To the office of his or her county, city, or township clerk.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) By a mailed application.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The election inspector shall contact the city or township clerk to verify whether the individual who signed the sworn statement under subsection (2) is listed in the registration records of the jurisdiction or whether there is any information contrary to the content of the sworn statement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the city or township clerk verifies the elector information and finds no information contrary to the information provided by the individual in the sworn statement and the individual presents identification for election purposes that contains a current residence address to establish his or her identity and residence address, the individual is permitted to vote a provisional ballot that is tabulated on election day in the same manner as an elector whose name is listed on the voter registration list, except that the election inspectors shall process the ballot as a challenged ballot under sections 745 and 746.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If the election inspector is not able to contact the city or township clerk, the individual is not in the correct precinct, or the individual is unable to present identification for election purposes that contains a current residence address, the individual must be issued a provisional ballot that is not tabulated on election day but is secured for verification after the election. A provisional ballot must also be issued under this subsection to a voter who presents identification for election purposes that does not bear the voter's current residence address, if the voter also presents a document to establish the voter's current residence address. The election inspector shall accept a document containing the name and current residence address of the voter as sufficient documentation to issue a provisional ballot if it is 1 of the following documents:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A current utility bill.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A current bank statement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A current paycheck, government check, or other government document.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A provisional ballot must be placed in a provisional ballot return envelope prescribed by the secretary of state and delivered to the city or township clerk after the polls close in a manner as prescribed by the secretary of state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) For a provisional ballot voted under subsection (4), the election inspector shall provide the voter with a notice that his or her ballot has been tabulated. For a provisional ballot voted under subsection (5), the election inspector shall provide the voter with a notice that the voter's information will be verified by the clerk of the jurisdiction within 6 days after the election to determine whether the ballot will be tabulated and, if the ballot is not tabulated, to determine the reason it was not tabulated. A clerk of a jurisdiction shall provide a free access system for the voter to determine whether the ballot was tabulated. The free access system may include a telephone number that does not require a toll charge, a toll-free telephone number, an internet website, or a mailed notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) As used in this section and sections 813 and 829, "provisional ballot" means a special ballot utilized for an individual who is not listed on the voter registration list at the polling place that is tabulated only after verification of the individual's eligibility to vote.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a city or township has processed 500 or more election day voter registrations in either or both of the previous 2 general November elections, the board of election commissioners of that city or township may establish election day vote centers to tabulate ballots issued to electors who register to vote or update voter registration on election day. No later than 90 days before an election, the board of election commissioners of a city or township that establishes an election day vote center under this subsection must inform the county clerk of the county in which that city or township is located that an election day vote center will be established in that city or township. No later than the fourth day before election day, the city or township clerk of a city or township that establishes an election day vote center shall post notice of the establishment and location of that election day vote center on the website of the city or township, if available, and in the clerk's office.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An election day vote center operates as a polling place and must have at least 3 election inspectors appointed under section 674 and be located in the same building where the city or township clerk provides election day registration, which includes a satellite office of that city or township clerk. A political party, or an incorporated organization or organized committee of interested citizens as described under sections 730 and 731, may have 1 challenger for every 8 election inspectors assigned to an election day vote center.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Only an elector who registers to vote or updates the elector's voter registration in the city or township on election day is eligible to cast a ballot at an election day vote center that is located in the same building in which the elector registers to vote or updates the elector's voter registration. The registered elector must present to an election inspector at the election day vote center the voter registration receipt issued to that elector under section 497(5) by the city or township clerk on election day, and must comply with all of the other requirements for an elector under section 523. An election inspector in an election day vote center shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Allow an elector to cast a ballot in the same manner as an elector whose name is listed on the voter registration list in an election day precinct.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Enter the elector's name in the poll book approved by the secretary of state for use in an election day vote center.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Issue a ballot to the elector who shall mark the ballot and deposit the ballot in the tabulator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A city or township clerk shall configure an election day vote center with at least 1 tabulator and a corresponding poll book that lists the electors issued a ballot to be cast on that tabulator. The collected voter registration receipts under subsection (3) serve as 1 of the required poll lists, and the list of electors issued a ballot in the poll book serves as the second required poll list.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The county clerk shall program the tabulators to be used in an election day vote center so that the results will be included in the unofficial and official election accumulation reports that are part of the election day precinct results. The number of tabulators and poll books must conform to the manner in which the county clerk programs tabulators for use in an election day vote center.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An elector who is in line at a city or township clerk's office, including a satellite office of that city or township clerk, by 8 p.m. on election day to register to vote or update a voter registration must be allowed to complete the voter registration transaction and be allowed to cast a ballot immediately after that transaction at that city or township election day vote center. The election inspectors at an election day vote center must allow an elector who was issued a voter registration receipt at the city or township clerk's office on election day and who is in line at that election day vote center by 8 p.m. on election day to cast a ballot, including after 11:59 p.m. on election day if necessary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The election inspectors at an election day vote center must follow the same process required at an election day polling place after the last elector in line casts a ballot.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The county or city clerk, after the last day specified in this act for receiving and filing nominating petitions, shall immediately certify to the proper board or boards of election commissioners in the city, county, district, or state the name and post office address of each party candidate whose petitions meet the requirements of this act, together with the name of the political party and the office for which he or she is a candidate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the county clerk receives a sworn complaint, in writing, questioning the registration or genuineness of the signature of the circulator or of a person signing a petition filed with the county clerk for an office, the county clerk shall commence an investigation. The county clerk shall cause the petition that he or she considers necessary to be forwarded to the proper city clerk or township clerk to compare the signatures appearing on the petition with the signatures appearing on the registration record as required by subsection (13). The county clerk may conduct the signature comparisons as required by subsection (13) using the digitized signatures in the qualified voter file, in lieu of requesting the local clerk to conduct the signature comparison. If the request has been made by the county clerk, the city clerk or township clerk shall complete the investigation and report his or her findings to the county clerk within 7 days after the request. The investigation shall include the validity of the signatures and the genuineness of a petition as is specified in the sworn complaint and may include any other doubtful signatures or petitions filed on behalf of the candidate against whose petitions the sworn complaint is directed, as the county clerk considers necessary. The county clerk is not required to act on a complaint respecting the validity and genuineness of signatures on a petition unless the complaint sets forth the specific signatures claimed to be invalid and the specific petition for which the complaint questions the validity and genuineness of the signature or registration of the circulator, and unless the complaint is received by the county clerk within 7 days after the deadline for the filing of the nominating petitions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In addition to the duty specified in subsection (2) for the examination of petitions, the county clerk, on his or her own initiative, on receipt of the nominating petitions, may examine the petitions, and if after examination the county clerk is in doubt as to the validity of the registration or genuineness of the signature of the circulator or persons signing or purported to have signed the petitions, the county clerk shall commence an investigation. Subject to subsection (13), the county clerk shall cause the petitions in question to be forwarded to the proper city clerk or township clerk to compare the signatures appearing on the petitions with the signatures appearing on the registration records. The county clerk may conduct the signature comparisons as required by subsection (13) using the digitized signatures in the qualified voter file, in lieu of requesting the local clerk to conduct the signature comparison.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The clerk of a political subdivision shall cooperate fully with the county clerk in a request made to the clerk by the county clerk in determining the validity of doubtful signatures by checking the signatures against registration records in an expeditious and proper manner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) At least 2 business days before the county clerk makes a final determination on challenges to and sufficiency of a petition, the county clerk shall make public its staff report concerning disposition of challenges filed against the petition. Beginning with the receipt of any document from local election officials under subsection (2) or (3), the county clerk shall make that document available to petitioners and challengers on a daily basis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Upon the completion of the investigation or examination, the county clerk shall immediately make an official declaration of the sufficiency or insufficiency of nominating petitions for which a sworn complaint has been received or of the sufficiency or insufficiency of nominating petitions that the county clerk has examined or investigated on his or her own initiative. A person feeling aggrieved by a determination made by the county clerk may have the determination reviewed by the secretary of state by filing a written request with the secretary of state within 3 days after the official declaration of the county clerk, unless the third day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which case the request may be filed not later than 4 p.m. on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Alternatively, the aggrieved person may have the determination of the county clerk reviewed by filing a mandamus, certiorari, or other appropriate remedy in the circuit court. A person who filed a nominating petition and feels aggrieved by the determination of the secretary of state may then have that determination reviewed by mandamus, certiorari, or other appropriate remedy in the circuit court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A city clerk with whom nominating petitions are filed may examine the petitions and investigate the validity and genuineness of signatures appearing on the petitions. Subject to subsection (13), the city clerk may check the signatures against registration records. The city clerk shall make a determination as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the petitions upon the completion of the examination or investigation, and shall make an official declaration of the findings. A person feeling aggrieved by the determination has the same rights of review as in case of a determination by the county clerk.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) Upon the filing of nominating petitions with the secretary of state, the secretary of state shall notify the board of state canvassers within 5 days after the last day for filing the petitions. The notification shall be by first-class mail. Upon the receipt of the nominating petitions, the board of state canvassers shall canvass the petitions to ascertain if the petitions have been signed by the requisite number of qualified and registered electors. Subject to subsection (13), for the purpose of determining the validity of the signatures, the board of state canvassers may cause a doubtful signature to be checked against the qualified voter file or the registration records by the clerk of a political subdivision in which the petitions were circulated. If the board of state canvassers receives a sworn complaint, in writing, questioning the registration of or the genuineness of the signature of the circulator or of a person signing a nominating petition filed with the secretary of state, the board of state canvassers shall commence an investigation. Subject to subsection (13), the board of state canvassers shall verify the registration or the genuineness of a signature as required by subsection (13). If the board is unable to verify the genuineness of a signature on a petition, the board shall cause the petition to be forwarded to the proper city clerk or township clerk to compare the signatures on the petition with the signatures on the registration record, or in some other manner determine whether the signatures on the petition are valid and genuine. The board of state canvassers is not required to act on a complaint respecting the validity and genuineness of signatures on a petition unless the complaint sets forth the specific signatures claimed to be invalid and the specific petition for which the complaint questions the validity and genuineness of the signature or the registration of the circulator, and unless the complaint is received by the board of state canvassers within 7 days after the deadline for filing the nominating petitions. After receiving a request from the board of state canvassers under this subsection, the clerk of a political subdivision shall cooperate fully in determining the validity of doubtful signatures by rechecking the signatures against registration records in an expeditious and proper manner. The board of state canvassers may extend the 7-day challenge period if it finds that the challenger did not receive a copy of each petition sheet that the challenger requested from the secretary of state. The extension of the challenge deadline under this subsection does not extend another deadline under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) The board of state canvassers may hold a hearing upon a complaint filed or for a purpose considered necessary by the board of state canvassers to conduct an investigation of the petitions. In conducting a hearing, the board of state canvassers may issue subpoenas and administer oaths. The board of state canvassers may also adjourn periodically awaiting receipt of returns from investigations that are being made or for other necessary purposes, but shall complete the canvass not less than 9 weeks before the primary election at which candidates are to be nominated. Before making a final determination, the board of state canvassers may consider any deficiency found on the face of the petition that does not require verification against data maintained in the qualified voter file or in the voter registration files maintained by a city or township clerk.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) At least 2 business days before the board of state canvassers meets to make a final determination on challenges to and sufficiency of a petition, the board shall make public its staff report concerning disposition of challenges filed against the petition. Beginning with the receipt of any document from local election officials under subsection (8), the board of state canvassers shall make that document available to candidates and challengers on a daily basis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) An official declaration of the sufficiency or insufficiency of a nominating petition shall be made by the board of state canvassers not less than 60 days before the primary election at which candidates are to be nominated. At the time of filing a nominating petition with the secretary of state, the person filing the petition may request a notice of the approval or rejection of the petition. If a request is made at the time of filing the petition, the secretary of state, immediately upon the determination of approval or rejection, shall transmit by registered mail to the person making the request an official notice of the sufficiency or insufficiency of the petitions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) A person who filed a nominating petition with the secretary of state and who feels aggrieved by a determination made by the board of state canvassers may have the determination reviewed by mandamus, certiorari, or other appropriate process in the supreme court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) The qualified voter file may be used to determine the validity of petition signatures by verifying the registration of signers. If the qualified voter file indicates that, on the date the elector signed the petition, the elector was not registered to vote, there is a rebuttable presumption that the signature is invalid. If the qualified voter file indicates that, on the date the elector signed the petition, the elector was not registered to vote in the city or township designated on the petition, there is a rebuttable presumption that the signature is invalid. The qualified voter file shall be used to determine the genuineness of a signature on a petition. Signature comparisons shall be made with the digitized signatures in the qualified voter file. The county clerk or the board of state canvassers shall conduct the signature comparison using digitized signatures contained in the qualified voter file for their respective investigations. If the qualified voter file does not contain a digitized signature of an elector, the city or the township clerk shall compare the petition signature to the signature contained on the master card.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) Not less than 60 days before the primary election at which candidates are to be nominated, the secretary of state shall certify to the proper boards of election commissioners in the various counties in the state, the name and post office address of each partisan or nonpartisan candidate whose petitions have been filed with the secretary of state and meet the requirements of this act, together with the name of the political party, if any, and the office for which he or she is a candidate.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) When filing a nominating petition, qualifying petition, filing fee, or affidavit of candidacy for a federal, county, state, city, township, village, metropolitan district, or school district office in any election, a candidate shall file with the officer with whom the petitions, fee, or affidavit is filed 2 copies of an affidavit of identity. A candidate nominated for a federal, state, county, city, township, or village office at a political party convention or caucus shall file an affidavit of identity within 1 business day after being nominated with the secretary of state. The affidavit of identity filing requirement does not apply to a candidate nominated for the office of President of the United States or Vice President of the United States.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An affidavit of identity must contain the candidate's name and residential address; a statement that the candidate is a citizen of the United States; the title of the office sought including the jurisdiction, district, circuit, or ward; the candidate's political party or a statement indicating no party affiliation if the candidate is running without political party affiliation; the term of office; the date of the election in which the candidate wishes to appear on the ballot; a statement that the candidate meets the constitutional and statutory qualifications for the office sought; other information that may be required to satisfy the officer as to the identity of the candidate; and the manner in which the candidate wishes to have his or her name appear on the ballot. If a candidate is using a name that is not a name that he or she was given at birth, the candidate shall include on the affidavit of identity the candidate's full former name. If the affidavit of identity is for a candidate for precinct delegate, the candidate shall include his or her precinct number on the affidavit of identity. If the affidavit of identity is for a judicial candidate, the candidate shall include on the affidavit of identity whether the office sought is an incumbent position, a nonincumbent position, or a new judgeship.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The requirement to indicate a name change on the affidavit of identity does not apply if the name in question is 1 of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A name that was formally changed at least 10 years before filing as a candidate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A name that was changed in a certificate of naturalization issued by a federal district court at the time the individual became a naturalized citizen at least 10 years before filing as a candidate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A name that was changed because of marriage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A name that was changed because of divorce, but only if to a legal name by which the individual was previously known.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) A name that constitutes a common law name as provided in section 560b. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) An affidavit of identity must include a signed and notarized statement that as of the date of the affidavit, all statements, reports, late filing fees, and fines required of the candidate or any candidate committee organized to support the candidate's election under the Michigan campaign finance act, 1976 PA 388, MCL 169.201 to 169.282, have been filed or paid; and a statement that the candidate acknowledges that making a false statement in the affidavit is perjury, punishable by a fine up to $1,000.00 or imprisonment for up to 5 years, or both. If a candidate files the affidavit of identity with an officer other than the county clerk or secretary of state, the officer shall immediately forward to the county clerk 1 copy of the affidavit of identity by first-class mail, facsimile, or electronic transmission. The county clerk shall immediately forward 1 copy of the affidavit of identity for state and federal candidates to the secretary of state by first-class mail, facsimile, or electronic transmission. An officer shall not certify to the board of election commissioners the name of a candidate who fails to comply with this section, or the name of a candidate who executes an affidavit of identity that contains a false statement with regard to any information or statement required under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If petitions or filing fees are filed by or on behalf of a candidate for more than 1 office, either federal, state, county, city, village, township, metropolitan district, or school district, the terms of which run concurrently or overlap, the candidate so filing, or on behalf of whom petitions or fees were so filed, shall select the 1 office to which his or her candidacy is restricted within 3 days after the last day for the filing of petitions or filing fees unless the petitions or filing fees are filed for 2 offices that are combined or for offices that are not incompatible. Failure to make the selection disqualifies a candidate with respect to each office for which petitions or fees were so filed and the name of the candidate must not be printed upon the ballot for those offices. A vote cast for that candidate at the ensuing primary or general election must not be counted and is void.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A violation of this section for perjury is distinct and separate from any violation of the Michigan campaign finance act, 1976 PA 388, MCL 169.201 to 169.282.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 561.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   The ballots prepared by the board of election commissioners in each county for use by the electors of a political party at a primary election shall include the name of each candidate of the political party for the office of governor, United States senator, and district offices; for the county, the name of each candidate of the political party for county offices; and for each township, the name of each candidate of the political party for township offices.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If, in a district that is a county or entirely within 1 county, 2 or more candidates, including candidates for nonpartisan offices, for the same office have the same or similar surnames, a candidate may file a written request with the board of county election commissioners for a clarifying designation. The request shall be filed not later than 3 days after the last date for filing nominating petitions. Not later than 3 days after the filing of the request, the board of county election commissioners shall determine whether a similarity exists and whether a clarifying designation should be granted. In a district located in more than 1 county, the board of state canvassers shall make a determination whether to grant a clarifying designation upon the written request of a candidate who files nominating petitions with the secretary of state. The request shall be filed with the state board of canvassers not later than 5 days after the last date for filing nominating petitions. The board of state canvassers shall make its determination at the same time it makes a declaration of the sufficiency or insufficiency of nominating petitions in compliance with section 552.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In each instance, the determining board shall immediately notify each candidate for the same office as the requester that a request for a clarifying designation has been made and of the date, time, and place of the hearing. The requester and each candidate for the same office shall be notified of the board's determination by first-class mail sent within 24 hours after the final date for the determination. A candidate who is dissatisfied with the determination of the board of county election commissioners may file an appeal in the circuit court of the county where the board is located. A candidate who is dissatisfied with the determination of the board of state canvassers may file an appeal in the Ingham county circuit court. The appeal shall be filed within 14 days after the final date for determination by the board. The court shall hear the matter de novo. Except as provided in subsection (4), in the case of the same surname or of a final determination by the board or by the court before the latest date that the board can arrange the ballot printing of the existence of similarity, the board shall print the occupation, date of birth, or residence of each of the candidates on the ballot or ballot labels under their respective names. The term "occupation" includes a currently held political office, even though it is not the candidate's principal occupation, but does not include reference to a previous position or occupation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)    If there are 2 candidates with the same or similar surnames and 1 of the candidates is entitled to an incumbency designation by section 24 of article VI of the state constitution of 1963, no other designation shall be provided for the other candidate with the same or similar surname. If there are more than 2 candidates with the same or similar surname and 1 of the candidates is entitled to an incumbency designation by section 24 of article VI of the state constitution of 1963, a clarifying designation may be given to the other candidates with the same or similar surname. Except for an incumbency designation under section 24 of article VI of the state constitution of 1963, if 2 or more candidates with the same or similar surnames are related, the board shall only print the residence or date of birth of each of the candidates as a clarifying designation. As used in this subsection, "related" means that the candidates with the same or similar surnames are related within the third degree of consanguinity.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The board of state canvassers shall issue guidelines to ensure fairness and uniformity in the granting of designations and may issue guidelines relating to what constitutes the same or similar surnames. The board of state canvassers and the boards of county election commissioners shall follow the guidelines.</DIV>

The nominating petition shall contain valid signatures of registered and qualified electors equal to not less than 1/2 of 1% of the total votes cast in the state at the previous presidential election for the presidential candidate of the political party for which the individual is seeking this nomination. However, the total number of signatures required on a nominating petition under this subsection shall not exceed 1,000 times the total number of congressional districts in this state. A signature on a nominating petition is not valid if obtained before October 1 of the year before the presidential election year in which the individual seeks nomination. To be valid, a nominating petition must conform to the requirements of this act regarding nominating petitions, but only to the extent that those requirements do not conflict with the requirements of this subsection.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) National convention delegates elected under this act shall be elected on a basis that insures that the proportion of the total national convention delegation that is uncommitted or is committed to each presidential candidate equals, as near as is practicable, the proportion of the popular vote that was cast as uncommitted or for each respective presidential candidate of the particular political party's total popular vote at the presidential primary election. The determination of these proportions shall only include the votes cast as uncommitted, or for a particular presidential candidate, if the total vote cast as uncommitted, or for that particular presidential candidate, equals at least the percentage determined by state political party rule of the total vote cast for all presidential candidates or as uncommitted for that political party at that presidential primary election.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Before an individual may be elected as a delegate to the national convention of a political party, that individual shall file an affidavit as required under section 562b. If the individual names a presidential candidate in the affidavit under section 562b(1)(a), that individual shall also be certified by the presidential candidate or the presidential candidate's designee as a delegate committed to that presidential candidate. A national convention delegate shall be bound to vote for the presidential candidate for whom he or she designated commitment, if any, under section 562b and as certified by the presidential candidate or the presidential candidate's designee under this section before the delegate is elected as a national delegate until the end of the first ballot at the national convention.

This subsection does not prohibit that person from participating in other convention business. Neither this provision nor any other provision of law shall be understood to restrict the opportunity of any registered elector in this state, including all public officials, to be elected as a delegate to any county, district, state, or national convention of the elector's political party.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The legislative body in each municipality shall provide a suitable polling place for each precinct located in the municipality for use on election day and shall provide a suitable early voting site for each precinct in the municipality for each election at which the municipality conducts early voting under section 720e. If at any election a municipality conducts early voting jointly with 1 or more other municipalities located in the same county, early voting sites for that election must be provided in accordance with section 720f. If at any election a county clerk conducts early voting for 1 or more municipalities located in the county, the board of county election commissioners of that county shall provide 1 or more early voting sites for that election as provided under section 720g. A publicly owned or controlled building, including, but not limited to, a municipal building or school building, must be used as a polling place unless it is not possible or convenient to use a publicly owned or controlled building as a polling place.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The legislative body of a city or township, or a board of county election commissioners as provided under section 720g, shall not designate as a polling place or early voting site a building that is owned or leased by an elected official, an individual who is a candidate, or a person that is regulated under the Michigan campaign finance act, 1976 PA 388, MCL 169.201 to 169.282. For purposes of the previous sentence, "leased" means that the entire building, and not just a portion of the building, is leased by an elected official, an individual who is a candidate, or a person that is regulated under the Michigan campaign finance act, 1976 PA 388, MCL 169.201 to 169.282. In addition, a building must not be designated as a polling place or early voting site if a portion of that building is leased by an elected official, an individual who is a candidate, or a person that is regulated under the Michigan campaign finance act, 1976 PA 388, MCL 169.201 to 169.282, and the portion of that building leased by an elected official, an individual who is a candidate, or a person that is regulated under the Michigan campaign finance act, 1976 PA 388, MCL 169.201 to 169.282, is located within 100 feet from the entrance of the polling place or early voting site located inside that building. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in section 4(1)(m) of article II of the state constitution of 1963 for early voting, the legislative body in each city or township may establish a central polling place or central polling places for 6 precincts or less if it is possible and convenient for the electors to vote at a central polling place or at central polling places. The legislative body in each city or township may abolish other polling places not required as a result of the establishment of a central polling place or central polling places.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A township board may provide polling places or early voting sites located within the limits of a city that has been incorporated from territory formerly a part of the township, and the electors of the township may cast their ballots at those polling places or early voting sites. If 2 contiguous townships utilize a combined township hall or other publicly owned or controlled building within 1 of the township's boundaries and outside of the other township's boundaries, and there is not another publicly owned or controlled building available or suitable for a polling place or early voting site within the other township, then each township board may provide a polling place or early voting site in that publicly owned building for 1 or more election precinct. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A city or township, or a county as provided under section 720g, shall not use as a polling place, early voting site, or central polling place a building that does not meet the requirements of this section. For early voting under sections 720a to 720j, if a city or township cannot secure a building to be used as a polling place or early voting site that meets the requirements of this section, that city or township must enter into a municipal agreement under section 720f or a county agreement under section 720g.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The legislative body of a city or township, or a board of county election commissioners as provided under section 720g, shall not establish, move, or abolish a polling place, early voting site, or central polling place less than 60 days before an election unless necessary because a polling place, early voting site, or central polling place has been damaged, destroyed, or rendered inaccessible or unusable as a polling place, early voting site, or central polling place. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The legislative body of a city or township, or a board of county election commissioners as provided under section 720g, shall ensure that a polling place, early voting site, or central polling place established under this section is accessible and complies with the voting accessibility for the elderly and handicapped act and the help America vote act of 2002.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) After a polling place or early voting site is approved under this section, the appropriate clerk, as provided under subsections (9) and (10), must provide a notice specifying the location of the polling place or early voting site to each registered elector entitled to vote at that polling place or early voting site. The notice requirement under this subsection applies to permanent and temporary changes to polling places and early voting sites, except that notice is not required if an early voting site is established in addition to 1 or more early voting sites that remain in effect for which notice was previously provided to each elector. The notice required under this subsection must be provided as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) No later than 45 days before an election for a polling place or early voting site established or changed by the sixtieth day before an election.</div>

In addition to the notice required to each registered elector under this subdivision, the appropriate clerk must post a sign indicating the new polling place location or early voting site at the location of the former polling place location or early voting site.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) After a polling place is approved under this section, the city or township clerk of the city or township approving the polling place must provide the notice required under subsection (8) by either of the following methods:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Updating and sending the voter identification card issued under section 499.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Sending a separate notice by mail or other method designed to provide actual notice to the registered elector.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) After an early voting site is approved under this section, the appropriate clerk must provide the notice required under subsection (8) by sending a separate notice by mail or other method designed to provide actual notice to the registered elector, and must not provide the notice by updating the voter identification card issued under section 499. In addition to identifying the location of the early voting site, the separate notice sent under this subsection must provide the hours of operation of the early voting site for each day early voting is offered.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For early voting conducted under section 720e, by the clerk of the municipality approving the early voting site.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For early voting conducted under section 720f, by the clerk of each municipality that is a party to the municipal agreement, or as otherwise provided by the municipal agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For early voting conducted under section 720g, by the clerk of the county where the early voting site is located or by the clerk of each municipality that is a party to the county agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) For temporary changes made under subsection (6) to a polling place within 20 days before an election or to an early voting site within 20 days before the start of early voting, the appropriate clerk must provide notice in all of the following ways:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) By posting a sign indicating the new polling place location or early voting site at the location of the former polling place location or early voting site.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) By posting the new polling place location or early voting site on the website of the municipality or county, as applicable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) By posting the new polling place location or early voting site on the department of state's website.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) As used in this section: </div>

An appointment of an election inspector under this section is void if a properly completed application for that election inspector is not on file in the clerk's office as prescribed in section 677. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The board of election commissioners shall designate 1 appointed election inspector as chairperson. The board of election commissioners shall appoint at least 1 election inspector from each major political party and shall appoint an equal number, as nearly as possible, of election inspectors in each election precinct from each major political party. The board of election commissioners may appoint election inspectors in an election precinct from minor political parties.

A board of election commissioners shall not appoint an individual as an election inspector if that individual declares a political party preference for 1 political party but is a known active advocate of another political party. As used in this section, "a known active advocate" means an individual who meets 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Is a delegate to the convention or an officer of that other political party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Is affiliated with that political party through an elected or appointed government position.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Has made documented public statements specifically supporting by name the other political party or its candidates in the same calendar year as the election for which the appointment is being made. As used in this subdivision, "documented public statements" means statements reported by the news media or written statements with a clear and unambiguous attribution to the applicant.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The county chair of a major political party may challenge the appointment of an election inspector based on the qualifications of the election inspector, the legitimacy of the election inspector's political party affiliation, or whether there is a properly completed declaration of political party affiliation in the application for that election inspector on file in the clerk's office. The challenge must be in writing, specifically identify the reason for the challenge, and include any available documentation supporting the challenge. The county chair of the political party shall file a challenge under this subsection with the board of election commissioners not later than 4 business days following receipt of the board of election commissioners' notice of appointed election inspectors under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Upon receipt of a challenge under subsection (3), the board of election commissioners shall determine whether the appointee has the necessary qualifications by reviewing the application or any other official records, such as voter registration records, or whether the applicant has a properly completed certification of political party affiliation in the application. If the challenge alleges that the appointee is a known active advocate of a political party other than the one on the appointee's application, the board of election commissioners immediately shall provide the appointee with a copy of the challenge by certified mail, personal service, or electronic transmission capable of determining date of receipt. The appointee may respond to the challenge within 2 business days after receiving a copy of the challenge. A response must be by affidavit addressing the specific reasons for the challenge. Failure to respond results in revocation of the appointment. Within 2 business days after receiving the challenge or a response from the appointee, whichever is later, the board of election commissioners shall make a final determination and notify the appointee and the county chair of the political party of the determination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) If a vacancy occurs in the office of chairperson or in the office of election inspector before election day, the chairperson of the board of election commissioners shall designate some other properly qualified applicant or election inspector as chairperson or some other qualified applicant as election inspector, as applicable, subject to this section.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The election commission of a city or township shall, by resolution, provide that at an election at which the ballots are counted and certified at the precinct, 1 or more additional boards of election inspectors be appointed to serve as receiving boards. For a precinct having receiving boards, the board of election commissioners shall appoint a receiving board consisting of 2 or more election inspectors, with an equal number from each major political party, and shall appoint an equal number of election inspectors from each major political party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Not less than 2 election inspectors in a precinct, representing each of the major political parties, shall deliver to the receiving board for that precinct a sealed ballot container containing the voted ballots, and, in a separate sealed envelope, the poll book and statement of returns. The poll book and statement of returns may be enclosed in a single sealed envelope.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The receiving board shall open the sealed envelope and review the poll book and statement of returns to determine both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) That the ballot container is properly sealed and the seal number is properly recorded in the poll book and the statement of returns. If the ballot container is not properly sealed or there is a discrepancy with the seal number recorded in the poll book or the statement of returns, the election inspectors who delivered the ballot container and the receiving board shall together take the necessary steps to correct the discrepancy. The election inspectors and the receiving board shall note the discrepancy and the corrective action in the remarks section of the poll book and all shall sign the notation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) That the number of individuals voting recorded in the poll book equals the number of ballots issued to electors, as shown by the statement of returns. If the number of individuals voting as shown by the poll book does not equal the number of ballots counted as shown by the statement of returns, and if an explanation of the discrepancy has not been noted in the poll book, the receiving board shall ask the election inspectors about the discrepancy, note the explanation in the poll book, and all shall sign the notation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the poll book or statement of returns has been erroneously sealed in the ballot container, the election inspectors may open the ballot container and remove the poll book or statement of returns. The elections inspectors and receiving board shall note the corrective action in the remarks section of the poll book and all shall sign the notation before placing the poll book or statement of returns in a separate sealed envelope. If the statement of returns was sealed in the ballot container and the poll book was sealed in an envelope, the poll book must be removed from the sealed envelope for the notation of corrective action to be recorded before placing the poll book and statement of returns in a sealed envelope. The receiving board shall notify the clerk of the board of canvassers responsible for canvassing all or a portion of the election of the corrective action taken.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) When the receiving board has completed the review under subsection (3), the receiving board shall place the poll book and statement of returns in the appropriate envelope, sealed with a red paper seal and initialed by the receiving board. If permitted by the clerk of the board of canvassers, the poll books and statement of returns from more than 1 precinct may be included and delivered in a single envelope.</div>

It is the duty of the inspectors, so notified, to attend the meeting unless excused by the county clerk for good cause. Compensation may be paid to them by their respective municipalities at a rate as determined by the governing bodies. An election inspector shall not serve in any election unless he or she has within the last preceding 2 years either attended an election school or has passed satisfactorily an examination given by the election commission of the city or township in which appointed. The examination is subject to the approval of the secretary of state. This section does not prevent the appointment of an election inspector to fill a vacancy.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The board of election commissioners in each county shall have the name of each candidate for federal, state, district, county, and township offices at an election printed on 1 ballot, separate from any other ballot. The name of each candidate of each political party must be placed under the name of the office for which the candidate was certified to have been nominated along with the political party name under the candidate's name.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If, in a district that is a county or entirely within 1 county, 2 or more candidates nominated by the same political party or by different political parties for the same office, or nonpartisan candidates for the same office, have the same or similar surnames, a candidate may file a written request with the board of county election commissioners for a clarifying designation. The request must be filed not later than 3 days after the certification of the relevant candidates. Not later than 3 days after the filing of the request, the board of county election commissioners shall determine whether a similarity exists and whether a clarifying designation should be granted. In a district located in more than 1 county, the board of state canvassers shall make a determination whether to grant a clarifying designation upon the written request of a candidate who is certified by the secretary of state. The request must be filed with the board of state canvassers not later than 3 days after the board of state canvassers completes the canvass of the primary election in compliance with section 581 and the certification of nominees in compliance with section 687. The board of state canvassers shall make its determination not later than 3 days after the request is filed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) In each instance, the determining board shall immediately notify each candidate for the same office as the requester that a request for a clarifying designation has been made and of the date, time, and place of the hearing. The requester and each candidate for the same office must be notified of the board's determination by first-class mail sent within 24 hours after the final date for the determination. A candidate who is dissatisfied with the determination of the board of county election commissioners may file an appeal in the circuit court of the county where the board is located. A candidate who is dissatisfied with the determination of the board of state canvassers may file an appeal in the Ingham County circuit court. The appeal must be filed within 14 days after the final date for determination by the board. The court shall hear the matter de novo. Except as provided in subsection (4), in the case of the same surname or of a final determination by the board or by the court before the latest date that the board can arrange for the ballot printing of the existence of similarity, the board shall print the occupation, date of birth, or residence of each of the candidates having the same or similar surnames on the ballot or ballot labels or slips to be placed on the voting machine, when used, under their respective names. The request may not be made by a candidate of a political party whose candidate for secretary of state received less than 10% of the total vote cast in the state for all candidates for secretary of state in the most recent November election in which a secretary of state was elected. As used in this subsection, "occupation" includes a currently held political office, even though it is not the candidate's principal occupation, but does not include reference to a previous position or occupation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If there are 2 candidates with the same or similar surnames and 1 of the candidates is entitled to an incumbency designation by section 24 of article VI of the state constitution of 1963, no other designation shall be provided for the other candidate with the same or similar surname. If there are more than 2 candidates with the same or similar surname and 1 of the candidates is entitled to an incumbency designation by section 24 of article VI of the state constitution of 1963, a clarifying designation may be given to the other candidates with the same or similar surname. Except for an incumbency designation under section 24 of article VI of the state constitution of 1963, if 2 or more candidates with the same or similar surnames are related, the board shall only print the residence or date of birth of each of the candidates as a clarifying designation. As used in this subsection, "related" means that the candidates with the same or similar surnames are related within the third degree of consanguinity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The board of state canvassers shall issue guidelines to ensure fairness and uniformity in the granting of designations and may issue guidelines relating to what constitutes the same or similar surnames. The board of state canvassers and the boards of county election commissioners shall follow the guidelines.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   If he has removed from this state to another place within the United States or its possessions, was a duly qualified and registered elector in a city or township of this state at the time of removal, and produces evidence that he cannot yet qualify to so vote in his present place of residence.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A citizen qualified to vote for president and vice-president under this act, upon making proper application shall be furnished with an absent voter ballot for president and vice-president only as provided in this act.

The application shall contain a certificate of the voting officer of the place of previous residence which shall be completed at the time of filing and shall also contain a statement that the applicant possesses all the qualifications of an elector in Michigan except those relating to residence and that as to residence he will have resided in the state of Michigan for a period of less than 6 months and in the city or township of present residence at least 30 days immediately prior to the election. The application shall be sworn to before the clerk and upon acceptance by the clerk shall serve as a temporary registration which shall be valid for that election only.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) For a presidential primary election, the secretary of state shall revise the absent voter ballot application form described in subsection (7) to require that a presidential primary elector indicate a political party ballot selection when requesting an absent voter ballot and provide a separate form for a presidential primary elector who has previously applied for an absent voter ballot to indicate or change a political party ballot selection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) An elector may request delivery of the elector's absent voter ballot to an address that is not the elector's registration address.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) The online absent voter ballot application provided and maintained by the secretary of state under subsection (15) must provide an opportunity for an elector to use the elector's stored digital signature on file with the secretary of state on the online absent voter ballot application.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) "Manual digital signature" means a digitally captured image of an elector's handwritten signature.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) "Stored digital signature" means the image of a registered elector's signature captured by the department of state and maintained in the department of state's motor vehicle database.</div>

The state bureau of elections may require the clerk of a city or township that did not comply with the 45-day deadline under this subsection, but provided a written explanation, to provide additional information. The state bureau of elections shall require the clerk of a city or township that did not comply with the 45-day deadline and that did not provide a written explanation to file a written explanation, describing the remedial actions taken by the city or township clerk, within 1 business day after the state bureau of elections notifies the clerk of that city or township.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) For a presidential primary election, the secretary of state shall prescribe procedures for contacting an elector who is an absent uniformed services voter or an overseas voter, as described in this section, and who is eligible to receive an absent voter ballot or who applies for an absent voter ballot for the presidential primary election, offering the elector the opportunity to select a political party ballot for the presidential primary election.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) The secretary of state shall order a city or township clerk to extend the ballot receipt deadline for any absent voter ballots under this section that were not transmitted to an absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter in compliance with subsection (5). The extension must equal the total number of days beyond the deadline as provided in subsection (5) that the city or township clerk transmitted the requested absent voter ballots. These absent voter ballots received during the extension time must be counted and tabulated for the final results of the election provided that the absent voter ballots are executed and sent by the close of the polls on election day. The election may be formally certified before the end of the extension time if the number of outstanding absent voter ballots under this subsection will not alter the outcome of the election.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) The secretary of state shall promulgate rules that establish policies and procedures for the electronic return of voted ballots by eligible members. In promulgating rules that establish the policies and procedures for the electronic return of voted ballots by eligible members, the secretary of state shall require an eligible member to use a United States Department of Defense verified electronic signature, as that term is defined in section 18a, so that the identity of the eligible member can be verified utilizing those policies and procedures. A member who is unable or unwilling to provide a United States Department of Defense verified electronic signature is not eligible to electronically return a voted ballot. The secretary of state shall take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and secrecy of voted ballots returned electronically. The secretary of state may develop and maintain a secure web portal on the secretary of state's website to facilitate the electronic return of voted ballots by eligible members.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If the clerk of a city or township receives an application for an absent voter ballot, the clerk must immediately determine if the applicant is registered to vote in that city or township and if the signature on the application agrees sufficiently with the signature on file for the individual as required in subsection (2). The clerk must immediately, upon verification of the application or, if the application is received and verified before the printing of the absent voter ballots, as soon as the absent voter ballots are received by the clerk, forward by mail, postage prepaid, or deliver the absent voter ballot to the applicant. The clerk must include with the absent voter ballot a postage prepaid absent voter ballot return envelope. A clerk shall not send an absent voter ballot to an applicant by first-class mail after 5 p.m. on the fourth day before an election. If the clerk of a city or township receives an application for an absent voter ballot from an applicant who is a program participant, as that term is defined in section 3 of the address confidentiality program act, 2020 PA 301, MCL 780.853, then the city or township clerk shall mail an absent voter ballot to that program participant at the designated address provided to that program participant by the department of the attorney general under the address confidentiality program act, 2020 PA 301, MCL 780.851 to 780.873. If the clerk of a city or township receives an absent voter ballot application after the deadline for a clerk to mail an absent voter ballot by first-class mail to the applicant under this subsection, and the clerk does not otherwise promptly provide the applicant with the absent voter ballot, the clerk must immediately notify the applicant that the applicant's absent voter ballot application was rejected as not timely received and notify the applicant of the alternative methods of voting available for that election. The clerk must notify the applicant by telephone, email, or text message, if available. In the absence of the applicant's telephone number or email address, the clerk must notify the applicant by United States mail. The clerk may also provide notice to the applicant by any other available methods of contact. Electronic notification of the rejection of the application under section 764c that provides the information required by this subsection constitutes sufficient notification to the applicant. However, an absent voter ballot application that is rejected must still be processed for any future elections indicated on that absent voter ballot application. If a county clerk receives an application for an absent voter ballot from an individual, the county clerk shall immediately forward that absent voter ballot application to the appropriate city or township clerk where that individual resides. If a city or township clerk receives an application for an absent voter ballot from an individual who is registered to vote in a different city or township, that clerk must immediately contact the individual to determine where the individual resides and should be registered to vote. If the city or township clerk determines that the individual is registered to vote in a different city or township, the city or township clerk must electronically forward the application to the clerk of the city or township in which the individual is registered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The signature on file must be used to determine the genuineness of a signature on an application for an absent voter ballot. Signature comparisons must be made using the procedures required under section 766a. If the clerk of a city or township rejects an absent voter ballot application because the signature on the absent voter ballot application does not agree sufficiently with the signature on file or because the elector failed to sign the absent voter ballot application, the applicant must be provided notice and the opportunity to cure the deficiency as provided under section 766a. The notice must inform the applicant that the applicant must cure the deficiency by 4 p.m. on the fourth day before the election in order to receive an absent voter ballot by first-class mail. If the applicant cures the deficiency as provided under section 766a by 4 p.m. on the fourth day before the election, the clerk must immediately send an absent voter ballot and a postage prepaid absent voter ballot return envelope to the applicant as provided under subsection (1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, and except for ballots delivered pursuant to an emergency absent voter ballot application under section 759b, absent voter ballots must be mailed or delivered to the applicant at the applicant's registration address unless the applicant requests that the absent voter ballot be sent to a different address as provided on the applicant's absent voter ballot application. In addition, a clerk may mail or deliver an absent voter ballot, on request of the applicant, to a post office box if the post office box is where the applicant normally receives personal mail and the applicant does not receive mail at the applicant's registration address. Subject to subsections (6) and (7), an absent voter ballot may be delivered to an applicant in person at the clerk's office.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The clerk shall enclose with the ballot a postage prepaid return envelope properly addressed to the clerk and bearing on the back of the return envelope a printed statement in substantially the following form:

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the following instructions for an absent voter must be included with each ballot or set of ballots furnished an absent voter:
<B></B><table>
    <tr>
      <td>INSTRUCTIONS
  FOR ABSENT VOTERS</td>
    </tr>
  </table><B></B>Step 1. Enclosed you will find voting instructions as to the method of voting. Read these carefully and then vote the ballot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Step 2. After voting a ballot, place the ballot in the secrecy sleeve, if any. If a secrecy sleeve is not provided, refold the ballot to conceal your votes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Step 3. If, after voting your absent voter ballot, you wish to take your marked absent voter ballot to your polling place on election day, or to an early voting site during the early voting period, to personally put your marked absent voter ballot into a tabulator to be counted, skip Steps 4 to 7 and proceed to Step 8. If you do not proceed to Step 8, and you wish to return your marked absent voter ballot to the clerk, proceed to Steps 4 to 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Step 4. Place the ballot or ballots in the return envelope and securely seal the return envelope.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Step 5. Sign and date the return envelope in the place designated. Your signature must appear on the return envelope or the ballot will not be counted. If you are disabled or otherwise unable to mark the ballot and required assistance in voting your absent voter ballot, have the individual who assisted you complete the section on the return envelope entitled "TO BE COMPLETED ONLY IF VOTER IS ASSISTED IN VOTING BY ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL".</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Step 6. Deliver the return envelope by 1 of the following methods:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Deposit the postage prepaid return envelope in the United States mail, or place the necessary postage on the return envelope and deposit the return envelope with another public postal service, express mail service, parcel post service, or common carrier.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Deliver the return envelope personally to the office of the clerk, to the clerk, or to an authorized assistant of the clerk, or to a secure drop box located in the city or township.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) In either (a) or (b), a member of your immediate family including a father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandparent, or grandchild or an individual residing in your household may mail or deliver a ballot to the clerk for you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) You may request by telephone that the clerk who issued the ballot provide assistance in returning the ballot. The clerk is required to provide assistance if you are unable to return your absent voter ballot as specified in (a), (b), or (c) above, if it is before 5 p.m. on the Friday immediately preceding the election, and if you are asking the clerk to pick up the absent voter ballot within the jurisdictional limits of the city, township, or village in which you are registered. Your absent voter ballot will then be picked up by the clerk or an election assistant sent by the clerk. All individuals authorized to pick up absent voter ballots are required to carry credentials issued by the clerk. If using this absent voter ballot return method, do not give your ballot to anyone until you have checked that individual's credentials.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Step 7. The ballot must reach the clerk or an authorized assistant of the clerk before the close of the polls on election day. An absent voter ballot received by the clerk or assistant of the clerk after the close of the polls on election day will not be counted. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Step 8. This step applies only if, after marking your absent voter ballot, you wish to take your marked absent voter ballot to your polling place on election day, or to an early voting site during the early voting period, to personally put your marked ballot into a tabulator to be counted. Bring your marked absent voter ballot that you placed in the secrecy sleeve under Step 2 to your polling place on election day, or to an early voting site during the early voting period, and indicate to the election inspectors that you are there to put your marked absent voter ballot into the tabulator to be counted. Before tabulating your ballot, you will be required to provide identification for election purposes to the election inspectors, or sign an affidavit that you do not have identification for election purposes, and complete the ballot application.

The clerk shall copy the certificate bearing the elector's signature, and the election inspectors shall reinsert the certificate into the return envelope and reseal the return envelope. The clerk shall proceed to determine whether the absent voter ballot is approved for tabulation as required under subsection (2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Except as otherwise provided under section 764d, the clerk of a city or township shall deliver absent voter ballot return envelopes to a board of election inspectors of an election day precinct only if the city or township has not established an absent voter counting board.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Subject to sections 764d and 765a(11), if a city or township has established an absent voter counting board, the clerk must deliver absent voter ballots approved for tabulation as provided under section 766 to the absent voter counting board by the time the election inspectors of the absent voter counting board report for duty on election day. Except as otherwise provided in section 764d, absent voter ballots received by the clerk by 8 p.m. on election day and approved for tabulation as provided under section 766 must be delivered to the absent voter counting board.</div>

The city or township clerk shall as soon as practicable, but no later than 90 days after the election, notify by mail, telephone, or email any elector who returned an absent voter ballot return envelope with an absent voter ballot that was not tabulated. The notification provided to an elector by the city or township clerk under this subsection must inform the elector that the elector's absent voter ballot was not tabulated and the reason that the absent voter ballot was not tabulated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) As close as possible to 8 p.m. on election day, the city or township clerk shall collect absent voter ballots from the post office at which the city or township clerk regularly receives mail addressed to the city or township clerk. Any return envelopes containing absent voter ballots that are received from the post office or from voters who voted by absent voter ballot in person in the clerk's office on election day must be reviewed and approved for tabulation before being delivered to the board of election inspectors or an absent voter counting board to be tabulated. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) On or before 8 a.m. on election day, the clerk shall post in the clerk's office or otherwise make public the number of absent voter ballots the clerk distributed to absent voters and the number of absent voter ballot return envelopes containing the marked ballots of absent voters received by the clerk before election day and to be delivered to the board of election inspectors or the absent voter counting boards under this act. As soon as possible after all precincts in the city or township are processed, the clerk shall post in the clerk's office or otherwise make public the number of absent voter ballots tabulated for that election. The city or township clerk shall maintain a record of the absent voter ballots that reconciles the number of absent voter ballots received as recorded in the qualified voter file with the number of absent voter ballots tabulated at the polling place locations or absent voter counting board locations in that city or township. This subsection applies only to elections in which a federal or state office appears on the ballot. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Subject to section 764d, if a city or township decides to use absent voter counting boards, the board of election commissioners of that city or township shall establish an absent voter counting board for each election day precinct in that city or township. The ballot form of an absent voter counting board must correspond to the ballot form of the election day precinct for which it is established. A city or township with 250 or more precincts may establish at least 1 absent voter counting board for each ballot form containing identical offices and candidate names, and that is considered a separate precinct for purposes of this section. After the polls close on election day, the county, city, or township clerk responsible for producing the accumulation report of the election results shall format the accumulation report as required under section 798b.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to section 764d, the board of election commissioners shall appoint the election inspectors to absent voter counting boards not less than 21 days before the election at which the absent voter counting boards are to be used. Sections 673a and 674 apply to the appointment of election inspectors to absent voter counting boards under this section. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If more than 1 absent voter counting board is to be used, the city or township clerk shall determine the number of electronic tabulators and the number of election inspectors to be used in each of the absent voter counting boards and to which absent voter counting board the absent voter ballots for each precinct are assigned for counting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) In a city or township that uses absent voter counting boards under this section, the absent voter ballots must be counted in the manner provided in this section and, except as otherwise provided in section 764d, absent voter ballots must not be delivered to the polling places. Subject to section 764d, the board of election commissioners shall provide a place for each absent voter counting board to count the absent voter ballots. Section 662 applies to the designation of the absent voter counting place or places in which the absent voter ballots will be processed and tabulated by election inspectors assigned to the absent voter counting boards under this section, except the location may be in a different jurisdiction if the county provides a tabulator for use at a central absent voter counting board location in that county. The places must be designated as absent voter counting places. Except as otherwise provided in this section, laws relating to election day precincts, including laws relating to the appointment of election inspectors, apply to absent voter counting places. The provisions of this section relating to tabulating absent voter ballots by electronic voting systems apply. High-speed tabulators and software to support those high-speed tabulators, as a component of an electronic voting system approved by the board of state canvassers for use in this state, may be used to tabulate absent voter ballots in an absent voter counting board.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) An election inspector, challenger, or any other individual in attendance at an absent voter counting place or combined absent voter counting place at any time after the processing of ballots has begun shall take and sign the following oath that may be administered by the clerk, a member of the clerk's staff, or the chairperson or a member of the absent voter counting board or combined absent voter counting board:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>"I (name of individual taking oath) do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I shall not communicate in any way information relative to any ballots or the tabulation of votes that may come to me while in this counting place until after the polls are closed. Further, I shall not photograph, or audio or video record, within the counting place, except for posted election results.".</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The oaths administered under subsection (7) must be placed in an envelope provided for the purpose and sealed with the red state seal. Following the election, the oaths must be delivered to the city or township clerk.

A second or subsequent shift of election inspectors appointed for an absent voter counting board may begin that shift at the time provided by the city or township clerk. If the election inspectors appointed to an absent voter counting board are authorized to work in shifts, at no time shall the absent voter ballots be left unattended during the transition from one shift to the next shift, or at any other time during the day after ballots are removed from the absent voter ballot return envelopes and before the absent voter ballots are sealed in the ballot container. At all times while absent voter ballots are being processed and tabulated, at least 1 election inspector from each major political party must be present at the absent voter counting place and the policies and procedures adopted by the secretary of state regarding the counting of absent voter ballots must be followed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) An individual who causes the polls to be closed or who discloses an election result before the polls can be legally closed on election day or in any manner characterizes how any ballot being counted has been marked is guilty of a felony.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) Tabulated absent voter ballots must be placed in an approved ballot container, and the ballot container must be sealed after all the ballots are tabulated in the manner provided by this act for election day precincts. The seal numbers must be recorded on the statement sheet, on the ballot container certificate, and in the poll book or addendum to the poll book.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The board of election commissioners of a city or township with a population of at least 5,000, or a board of county election commissioners as provided under section 764d, may authorize that absent voter counting boards be established under subsection (1) to process and tabulate absent voter ballots between the hours of 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on any of the 8 days before election day, beginning on the second Monday before election day and ending on the Monday immediately before election day.

If the location, dates, hours, or number of election inspectors changes, the clerk must publicly post a revised notice as soon as possible, but no later than the eleventh day before an election, on the website of the city or township, if available, and in the clerk's office. A revised notice must include the updated location, dates, hours, and number of election inspectors. If the clerk changes the number of election inspectors on subsequent days after processing and tabulating begins, the clerk shall post the updated number of election inspectors on the website of the city or township, if available, and in the clerk's office, no later than 10 a.m. on the day before the changes occur. If a city or township clerk fails to post a notice by 10 a.m. on the day before a change reducing the number election inspectors occurs, the clerk shall allow the number of challengers to remain at the same level even though the reduction in the number of election inspectors may have reduced the number of allowed challengers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) For each day of processing and tabulation of absent voter ballots before election day, a participating city or township clerk shall deliver the absent voter ballots approved for tabulation to an absent voter counting board. The instructions and procedures adopted by the secretary of state regarding the processing and tabulating of absent voter ballots before election day must be followed. Absent voter ballots must be processed and tabulated in the same manner and under the same requirements as absent voter ballots are processed and tabulated on election day. Election results must not be generated, printed, or reported before 8 p.m. on election day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) During the processing and tabulation of absent voter ballots before election day, each political party, and each incorporated organization or organized committee of interested citizens as described under sections 730 and 731, may designate 1 challenger for every 8 election inspectors serving at the absent voter counting place. If there are 7 or fewer election inspectors serving at an absent voter counting place, each political party, and each incorporated organization or organized committee of interested citizens as designated under sections 730 and 731, may designate 1 challenger. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) During the processing and tabulation of absent voter ballots before election day, the election inspectors shall secure tabulated ballots in a sealed ballot container consistent with subsection (10) at the end of each day. Tabulated ballots may be added to a ballot container used on a previous day or may be placed in an unused ballot container. The election inspectors shall complete the poll book ballot summary at the conclusion of each day to account for absent voter ballot return envelopes and absent voter ballots processed and tabulated on that day. The poll book, or an addendum to the poll book, must be signed and dated by 1 election inspector from each major political party who is present at the location after tabulation is completed each day. The city or township clerk shall post the number of absent voter ballots tabulated each day on the website of that city or township, if available, and in the clerk's office.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) A clerk shall not deliver any absent voter ballots received on a day early voting is being conducted to an absent voter counting board to be processed or tabulated until the following day. An absent voter ballot may be processed and tabulated only after receipt of the absent voter ballot appears on the registration list or an addendum to the registration list in an early voting site and the voter history of electors casting an early voting ballot on the previous day is recorded in the qualified voter file. An absent voter ballot must be canceled if the absent voter cast a ballot at an early voting site.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) The secretary of state shall develop instructions consistent with this act for the conduct of absent voter counting boards or combined absent voter counting boards. The secretary of state shall distribute the instructions developed under this subsection to county, city, and township clerks 40 days or more before a general election in which absent voter counting boards or combined absent voter counting boards will be used. A county, city, or township clerk shall make the instructions developed under this subsection available to the public and shall make the instructions available for inspection by challengers in attendance at an absent voter counting board or combined absent voter counting board. The instructions developed under this subsection are binding on the operation of an absent voter counting board or combined absent voter counting board used in an election conducted by a county, city, or township.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an individual shall not photograph, or audio or video record, within an absent voter counting place. A county, city, or township clerk, or an assistant of that clerk, shall expel an individual from the absent voter counting place if that individual violates this subsection. This subsection does not apply to any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) An individual who photographs, or audio or video records, posted election results within an absent voter counting place.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A county, city, or township clerk, or an employee, assistant, or consultant of that clerk, if the photographing, or audio or video recording, is done in the performance of that individual's official duties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If authorized by an individual in charge of an absent voter counting place, the news media that take wide-angled photographs or video from a distance that does not disclose the face of any marked ballot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) An individual shall not photograph or video record a ballot or any other election records, other than posted election results, in an absent voter counting place. An individual who violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) On receipt of any envelope containing the marked ballot of an absent voter, the city or township clerk shall determine whether the ballot is approved for tabulation by verifying both of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The elector is a registered elector and has not voted in person in that election.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Using the procedures required under section 766a, the signature on the absent voter ballot return envelope agrees sufficiently with the elector's signature on file.</div>

Subject to subsection (3), if the city or township clerk is not able to verify the information in subsection (1)(a) and (b), the clerk must reject the absent voter ballot return envelope.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a city or township clerk rejects an absent voter ballot return envelope because the signature on the absent voter ballot return envelope is missing or does not agree sufficiently with the elector's signature on file, the elector must be permitted an opportunity to cure the deficiency as provided under section 766a until 5 p.m. on the third day following the election in order for the absent voter ballot, if otherwise valid, to be accepted for tabulation.</div>

If any portion of this amendatory act or the application of this amendatory act to any person or circumstances is found invalid by a court, the invalidity shall not affect the remaining portions or applications of this amendatory act that can be given effect without the invalid portion or application, if the remaining portions are not determined by the court to be inoperable, and to this end this amendatory act is declared to be severable."<BR><B>Popular Name:</B> Election Code</p>
</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>168.766a Verification of signature; rejection of ballot; opportunity to cure; manner; notice; "signature on file" defined.</B><P>Sec. 766a.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A clerk may determine that a signature on an elector's absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot envelope does not agree sufficiently with the signature on file only after reviewing the signature using the process set forth in this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An elector's signature is invalid only if it differs in significant and obvious respects from the elector's signature on file. Slight dissimilarities must be resolved in favor of the elector. Exact signature matches are not required to determine that a signature agrees sufficiently with the signature on file.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If a clerk determines that the elector's signature on the absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope is missing or does not agree sufficiently with the signature on file, the clerk shall reject the absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope and provide the elector with notice and the opportunity to cure the deficiency as provided in this section. The clerk shall notify the elector of all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The nature of the deficiency and that the deficiency has resulted in the rejection of the elector's absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The need to cure the deficiency in order for the absent voter ballot application to be accepted or for the absent voter ballot to be tabulated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) How to cure the deficiency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The deadline for curing the deficiency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The alternative methods of voting if the deficiency is not cured.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) The clerk shall notify the elector of the deficiency described in subsection (3) within the deadlines specified under section 766b. The clerk must notify the elector by telephone, email, or text message, if available. In the absence of the elector's telephone number or email address, the clerk must notify the elector by United States mail. The clerk may also provide notice to the elector by any other available methods of contact. Electronic notification of the rejection of the absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope under section 764c that provides the information required by this section constitutes sufficient notification to the elector.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An elector may cure a deficiency described in subsection (3) by completing and submitting a cure form. The secretary of state shall prescribe the content and requirements of the cure form. An elector shall be permitted to receive and return a cure form electronically, in person, or by mail with postage prepaid as a supplement to the prepaid postage for the absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope. The city or township clerk in which the elector is registered may physically collect a cure form from the elector. A cure form must provide the elector the option to cure a deficiency in the elector's absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope by signing the statement required for the absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope under section 759 or 761. The secretary of state shall modify the statements to reflect that the elector is signing a cure form for the absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope rather than the original absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope. An elector must be permitted to submit an electronic image of the elector's physical signature in lieu of a physical signature for a cure form returned electronically. A clerk shall accept a cure form submitted under this subsection if the signature on the cure form agrees sufficiently with the signature on file, using the process as provided in this section. If the clerk determines that the signature on the cure form does not agree sufficiently with the signature on file, the clerk shall reject the cure form and contact the elector to provide information on other options to cure the deficiency and to provide the alternative methods of voting available for that election.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The secretary of state may issue instructions to clerks to provide electors with other options, other than by providing a signature under subsection (5), to cure the deficiency in the elector's absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) As used in this chapter, "signature on file" means any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Any signature of an elector contained in the qualified voter file.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the qualified voter file does not contain a copy of an elector's digitized signature, or is not accessible, the signature of the elector contained on the master card.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Only for purposes of the signature comparison conducted under section 766 for an elector's absent voter ballot envelope, the signature on the elector's absent voter ballot application.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Beginning 45 days before an election, if an absent voter ballot application or an absent voter ballot return envelope is received 6 or more calendar days before an election, the clerk must make a reasonable effort to verify or reject the absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope by the end of the next business day following the receipt of that application or return envelope. If the clerk determines that the elector's signature on the absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope is missing or does not agree sufficiently with the signature on file, the clerk must notify the elector as provided under section 766a by the end of the next business day following the receipt of the absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Subject to subsection (3), if an absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope is received 5 or fewer days before an election or on election day, the clerk must verify or reject the absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope by the end of the calendar day of receiving that application or return envelope. Subject to subsection (3), if the clerk determines that the elector's signature on the absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope is missing or does not agree sufficiently with the signature on file, the clerk must notify the elector as provided under section 766a by the end of the calendar day on which the application or return envelope was received.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the clerk determines that the elector's signature on an absent voter ballot application is missing or does not agree sufficiently with the signature on file after 4 p.m. on the fourth day before the election, the elector must be notified of the rejection of the elector's absent voter ballot application under section 761.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If an absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope comes into the physical control of the clerk's office before or during the clerk's scheduled business hours on a day, that absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope is considered received by the clerk on that day. If an absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope comes into the physical control of the clerk's office after the end of the clerk's scheduled business hours on a day, or if the absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope comes into the physical control of the clerk's office on a day on which the clerk does not have scheduled business hours, that absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope is considered received by the clerk on the first subsequent day on which the clerk has scheduled business hours.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Each absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope retrieved from an absent voter ballot drop box before or during the clerk's scheduled business hours is considered received by the clerk on the day the application or return envelope is retrieved. An absent voter ballot application or absent voter ballot return envelope retrieved from an absent voter ballot drop box after the end of the clerk's scheduled business hours on a day, or deposited in an absent voter ballot drop box on a day on which the clerk does not have scheduled business hours, is not considered received by the clerk until the first subsequent day on which the clerk has scheduled business hours.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) An absent voter ballot return envelope that is collected by an election official through the procedure provided under 764b(4) or (5) is considered received when the election official comes into physical possession of the absent voter ballot return envelope.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) Nothing in this section prevents a clerk from providing a notification to an elector under section 761 or 766 in a more timely manner than required.</div>

A referendum on Act 269 of 2001 was presented to the electors at the November 5, 2002, general election as Proposal 02-1, which read as follows:“A REFERENDUM ON PUBLIC ACT 269 OF 2001—AN ACT TO AMEND CERTAIN SECTIONS OF MICHIGAN ELECTION LAWPublic Act 269 of 2001 would:—Eliminate “straight party” vote option on partisan general election ballots.—Require Secretary of State to obtain training reports from local election officials.—Require registered voters who do not appear on registration list to show picture identification before voting a challenged ballot.—Require expedited canvass if presidential vote differential is under 25,000.—Require ballot counting equipment to screen ballots for voting errors to ensure the accurate tabulation of absentee ballots. Permit voters in polls to correct errors.—Provide penalties for stealing campaign signs or accepting payment for campaign work while being paid as a public employee to perform election duties.Should this law be approved?Yes __________No __________”Act 269 of 2001 was not approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon at the November 5, 2002, general election.<BR><B>Popular Name:</B> Election Code</p>

Electronic tabulating equipment that can detect that the choices recorded on an elector's ballot for an office or a question exceeds the number that the elector is entitled to vote for on that office or question must be located at each polling place and programmed to reject a ballot containing that type of an error. If a choice on a ballot is rejected as provided in this subdivision, an elector must be given the opportunity to have that ballot considered a spoiled ballot and to vote another ballot.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Before entering the voting station, each elector shall be offered instruction in the proper method of voting on the electronic voting system. If the elector needs additional instruction after entering the voting station, 2 election inspectors from different political parties may, if necessary, enter the voting station and provide the additional instructions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If the electronic voting system provides for the use of a ballot that is processed through electronic tabulating equipment after the elector votes, the elector shall transport the ballot to the ballot box, or other approved ballot container, without exposing any votes. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an election inspector shall ascertain, by comparing the number appearing on the ballot stub with the number recorded on the poll list, that the ballot delivered by the voter is the same ballot that was issued to the elector. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if the numbers do not agree, the ballot must be marked as "rejected", and the elector must not be allowed to vote. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if the numbers agree, an election inspector shall remove and discard the stub. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the election inspector shall deposit the ballot in the ballot box or other approved ballot container. If electronic tabulating equipment that deposits the voted ballot into the ballot box or other approved ballot container is used at the precinct, the election inspector shall return the ballot to the elector, and the elector shall deposit the ballot into the electronic tabulating equipment. The electronic tabulating equipment must be arranged so that the secrecy of the ballot is not violated. If required for the proper operation of the electronic tabulating equipment, 2 election inspectors from different political parties may periodically open the equipment to rearrange voted ballots and may transfer voted ballots to another approved ballot container. The requirement to compare a ballot number with the poll list does not apply to a ballot used for early voting that is produced by an on-demand ballot printing system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A ballot from which the stub is detached must not be accepted by the election inspector in charge of the ballot box or other approved ballot container. An elector who spoils the elector's ballot may return the ballot and secure another ballot. The word "spoiled" must be written across the face of the ballot, and the ballot must be marked and secured for later return.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A ballot of a challenged voter that has the names of candidates and questions printed directly on the voted ballot must be processed in the manner prescribed for challenging a vote cast by paper ballot. A challenge to a voter voting on an electronic voting system that does not use an individual hard copy ballot must be processed in the manner prescribed for challenging a vote cast on a voting machine.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Except as otherwise provided in this act, an election inspector shall not allow any portion of a ballot, including a ballot stub, to be removed by any individual other than an election inspector from the polling place.</div>

<P>Sec. 798.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Before beginning the count of ballots, the board of election commissioners shall test the electronic tabulating equipment to determine if the electronic tabulating equipment will accurately count the votes cast for all offices and on all questions. Public notice of the time and place of the test shall be given at least 48 hours before the test by publication in a newspaper published in the county, city, village, township, or school district where the electronic tabulating equipment is used. If a newspaper is not published in that county, city, village, township, or school district, the notice shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in that county, city, village, township, or school district. The test shall be conducted in the manner prescribed by rules promulgated by the secretary of state pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, being sections 24.201 to 24.328 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. In the test, a different number of valid votes shall be assigned to each candidate for an office, and for and against each question. If an error is detected, the board of election commissioners shall determine the cause of the error and correct the error. The board of election commissioners shall make an errorless count and shall certify the errorless count before the count is started. The electronic tabulating equipment that can be used for a purpose other than examining and counting votes shall pass the same test at the conclusion of the count before the election returns are approved as official.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   On completion of the test and count, the programs, test materials, and ballots arranged by precincts shall be sealed and retained as provided by this subsection and rules promulgated by the secretary of state pursuant to Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969. If the electronic tabulating equipment that is tested and certified to by the board of election commissioners will be used to count votes at the precinct, a memory device containing the tested programs, if any, shall be sealed into the electronic tabulating equipment. Upon completion and certification of the count of votes, the memory device containing the program and the vote totals shall remain sealed in the electronic tabulating equipment or, if removed from the electronic tabulating equipment, shall remain sealed in a container approved by the secretary of state, delivered to the clerk, and retained in the manner provided for other voted ballots.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The county clerk may conduct an unofficial count in order to provide early unofficial returns to the public. Upon completion of the count, the official returns shall be open to the public. The return of the electronic tabulating equipment, to which have been added the write-in and absentee votes if necessary, shall constitute, after being duly certified, the official return of each precinct or election district. If it becomes impracticable to count all or a part of the ballots with tabulating equipment, the clerk may direct that they be counted manually, following as far as practicable the provisions governing the counting of paper ballots. An accumulation report of unofficial results using the tabulated votes available after 8 p.m. on election day must be compiled and published using a format that clearly indicates all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The election day precinct results.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The corresponding absent voter ballot counting board results.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) For a city or township with 250 or more precincts using common ballot forms instead of the election day precinct format in the absent voter counting boards and early voting sites, the accumulation report will not report results from absent voter counting boards or early voting sites as corresponding to election day precincts. Accumulation reports in each city or township described in this subsection must report the results for each election day precinct and separately report the results of each absent voter counting board and the corresponding early voting results. Each common ballot form may constitute at least 1 separate absent voter counting board and early voting precinct.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   This section governs the recounting of a ballot on which a voter has made a selection by means of a punch, mark, or stamp.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If the electronic voting system requires that the elector cast a vote by punching out a hole in a ballot, the vote shall not be considered valid unless the portion of the ballot designated as a voting position is completely removed or is hanging by 1 or 2 corners or the equivalent.</DIV>

A stray mark made within a predefined area is not a valid vote. In determining whether a mark within a predefined area is a stray mark, the board of canvassers or election official shall compare the mark subject to recount with other marks appearing on the ballot. The secretary of state shall issue instructions, subject to the approval of the board of state canvassers, relevant to stray marks to ensure the fairness and uniformity of determinations made under this subsection.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If it is clearly evident from an examination of a ballot that the ballot has been mutilated for the purpose of distinguishing it or that there has been placed on the ballot some mark, printing, or writing for the purpose of distinguishing it, then that ballot is void and shall not be counted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) A cross, the intersection of which is within or on the line of the proper circle or square, or a check mark, the angle of which is within a circle or square, is valid. Crosses or check marks otherwise located on the ballot are void.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Marks other than crosses or check marks used to designate the intention of the voter shall not be counted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) A cross is valid even though 1 or both lines of the cross are duplicated, if the lines intersect within or on the line of the square or circle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Two lines meeting within or on the line of the square or circle, although not crossing each other, are valid if it is apparent that the voter intended to make a cross.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) A failure to properly mark a ballot as to 1 or more candidates does not alone invalidate the entire ballot if the ballot has been properly marked as to other candidates, unless the improper marking is determined to be a distinguishing mark as described in this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) Erasures and corrections on a ballot made by the elector in a manner frequently used for this purpose shall not be considered distinguishing marks or mutilations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) A ballot or part of a ballot from which it is impossible to determine the elector's choice of candidate is void as to the candidate or candidates affected by that determination.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) A vote cast for a deceased candidate is void and shall not be counted, except that a vote cast for a candidate for governor who has died, and for whom a replacement has not been made, shall be counted for the candidate for lieutenant governor of that party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) A ballot cast that is not counted shall be marked by the inspector "not counted", kept separate from the others by being tied or held in 1 package, and placed in the ballot box with the counted ballots.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) A vote shall not be counted for a candidate unless a cross or a check mark has been placed by the voter in the square before the space in which the name of the candidate has been printed, written, or placed.</div>

A stray mark made within a predefined area is not a valid vote. In determining whether a mark within a predefined area is a stray mark, the board of canvassers or election official shall compare the mark with other marks appearing on the ballot. The secretary of state shall issue instructions, subject to the approval of the board of state canvassers, relevant to stray marks to ensure the fairness and uniformity of determinations made under this subsection. A secretary of state's instruction relevant to stray marks shall not be applied to a ballot unless the secretary of state issued the instruction not less than 63 days before the date of the election.</div>

A candidate is aggrieved for purposes of this subsection only if, but for the error, the candidate would have received the largest number of votes eligible to be counted in the presidential election.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The supreme court has original and exclusive jurisdiction to consider a complaint for mandamus under subsection (1). A complaint for mandamus under subsection (1) must be filed with the supreme court within 48 hours after the certification or determination of the results of a presidential election and must name the board of state canvassers as a defendant. The governor, the attorney general, the secretary of state, and the candidate certified or determined by the board of state canvassers to be the winner of the presidential election may intervene in a proceeding described under subsection (1). To have conclusive effect on the determination of electors appointed by this state, the supreme court's final order in a proceeding described under subsection (1) must be issued not later than the day before the date that the electors for President and Vice President of the United States convene under section 47.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A proceeding described under subsection (1) must not delay any of the following:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The governor issuing or transmitting a certificate of ascertainment under section 46.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) A recount as provided under chapter XXXIII.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A party in a proceeding described under subsection (1) shall not seek preliminary relief.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A proceeding described under subsection (1) is not an election audit under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A proceeding described under subsection (1) is the exclusive means of seeking judicial relief from the certification or determination of the results of a presidential election.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) As used in this section, "presidential election" means the statewide general November election in 2024, and the statewide general November election every 4 years after 2024, that is determined solely by the vote of electors casting ballots in the election for a candidate for President and Vice President of the United States, including the election of electors of President and Vice President of the United States as provided under chapter IV.</div>

The county clerk shall prepare as many slips of paper as there are such persons, and write the word "elected" on as many slips of paper as there are offices to be filled, and the words "not elected" on the remaining slips, and fold the same so as to conceal the writing and so that they may appear as near alike as possible. The slips shall be placed in a box and, at the time and place appointed for the drawing of the lots, each of the persons aforesaid may draw 1 of the slips from the box, and any person drawing a slip on which is written the word "elected" shall be deemed legally elected to the office in question and the county clerk shall forthwith give him a certificate of election.

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upon the filing of a petition for recount, and the giving of notice, if notice is required to be given, the board of county canvassers shall be summoned by the clerk of the board and here make an investigation of the facts set forth in the petition. Should the recount involve a county or district office or proposition, the recount shall not be commenced until the board shall determine by communicating with the secretary of state that no petition has been filed requesting a recount by the board of state canvassers of ballots cast in the same district. In case said board shall be advised by the secretary of state that a petition has been filed with him praying for a recount by the board of state canvassers of the ballots cast in the same county or district, then no action shall be taken upon the recount until the county board shall receive instructions from the board of state canvassers. Nothing herein contained shall act to delay any recount of the ballots cast at any city, ward, township or village election if the ballots cast at such election are not sealed in the same ballot boxes with the state and county offices. With respect to any recount of ballots cast in any city, ward, township, village, school or district election, the board of county canvassers shall charge the appropriate local unit the actual and necessary expenses of conducting the recount, and the local unit shall pay such charges to the county treasurer.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The petition alleges that the candidate is aggrieved on account of fraud or mistake in the canvass of the votes by the inspectors of election or the returns made by the inspectors of election, or by a board of county canvassers or the board of state canvassers. The candidate must be able to allege a good-faith belief that but for fraud or mistake, the candidate would have had a reasonable chance of winning the election. The petition must contain specific allegations of wrongdoing only if evidence of that wrongdoing is available to the petitioner. If evidence of wrongdoing is not available, the petitioner is only required to allege fraud or a mistake in the petition without further specification.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the petition for a recount is filed not later than 48 hours following the completion of the canvass of votes cast at an election. If the recount petition relates to a state senatorial or representative district located wholly within 1 county or to the district of a Representative in Congress located wholly within 1 county, the petition for a recount must be filed not later than 48 hours following the adjournment of the meeting of the board of state canvassers at which the certificate of determination for that office was recorded under section 841. However, for a special election for Representative in Congress, state senator, or state representative for a district located wholly within 1 county, the petition for recount must be filed not later than 48 hours after the certificate of determination is filed with the secretary of the board of state canvassers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The petition is presented to and filed with the secretary of state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The petition is written or printed and is signed and sworn to by the candidate.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The petition specifies the counties, cities, townships, and precincts in which the recount is requested.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) If the office is the office of state representative, a copy of the petition is filed with the clerk of the house of representatives. If the office is the office of state senator, a copy of the petition is filed with the secretary of the senate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a state senatorial race is determined by a vote differential of 500 votes or less or a state representative race is determined by a vote differential of 200 votes or less, the chairperson of a state political party may petition for a recount of the votes on behalf of a candidate in that race in the manner prescribed in subsection (1). Notwithstanding subsection (1)(b) and (f), the petition filed under this subsection need not allege fraud or mistake. Notwithstanding subsection (1)(e), the petition must be signed by the chairperson of the state political party filing the petition under this subsection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) The ballots in a precinct petitioned for recount in a legislative contest must be recounted for that office by the board of state canvassers and must be preserved until the contest is disposed of under the rules of the legislative body that takes office beginning in January following the contested general election. In legislative recounts of a special general election, ballots in a precinct petitioned for recount must be preserved until the contest is disposed of under the rules of the legislative body serving at the time the report in subsection (4) is filed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Upon the completion of a recount for a legislative office, the board of state canvassers, in addition to the certification required by section 892, shall forward to the appropriate legislative body a report of the results of the recount.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A recall petition shall be filed with the filing officer provided in section 959 or 960. The filing official shall give a receipt showing the date of filing, the number of recall petition sheets filed, and the number of signatures claimed by the filer. This shall constitute the total filing, and additional recall petition sheets for this filing shall not be accepted by the filing official.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Within 7 days after a recall petition is filed, the filing official with whom the recall petition was filed shall examine the recall petition. The filing official shall determine if the recall petition is in proper form and shall determine the number of signatures of the recall petition. In determining the number of signatures, the filing official shall not count signatures on a recall petition sheet if 1 or more of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The execution of the certificate of circulator is not in compliance with this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The heading of the recall petition sheet is improperly completed. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The reasons for recall are different than those determined under section 951a by the board of state canvassers or the Michigan court of appeals or under section 952 by the board of county election commissioners or the circuit court to be factual and of sufficient clarity to enable the officer whose recall is sought and the electors to identify the course of conduct which is the basis for this recall.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The signature was obtained before the date of determination as provided under section 951a(8) by the board of state canvassers or the Michigan court of appeals, whichever occurs later, or as provided under section 952(8) by the board of county election commissioners or the circuit court, whichever occurs later, or more than 60 days before the filing of the recall petition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the filing official determines that the form of the recall petition is improper or that the number of signatures is less than the minimum number required in section 955, the filing official shall proceed as provided in section 963(1).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the filing official determines that the number of signatures is in excess of the minimum number required in section 955, the filing official shall determine the validity of the signatures by verifying the registration of signers under subsection (6) and may determine the genuineness of signatures under subsection (7) or shall forward each recall petition sheet to the clerk of the city or township appearing on the head of the recall petition sheet. However, the recall petition shall not be forwarded to the secretary of a school district.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The city or township clerk shall determine the validity of the signatures by verifying the registration of signers under subsection (6) and may determine the genuineness of signatures under subsection (7). Within 15 days after receipt of the recall petition, the city or township clerk shall attach to the recall petition a certificate indicating the number of signers on each recall petition sheet that are registered electors in the city or township and in the governmental unit for which the recall is sought. The certificate shall be on a form approved by the secretary of state and may be a part of the recall petition sheet. If the recall petition is for the recall of a village official, the county clerk shall forward the recall petition to the clerk of the village, and the duties and responsibilities of the city or township clerk as set forth in this section shall be performed by the village clerk.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) The qualified voter file shall be used to determine the validity of recall petition signatures by verifying the registration of signers. If the qualified voter file indicates that, on the date the elector signed the recall petition, the elector was not registered to vote, there is a rebuttable presumption that the signature is invalid. If the qualified voter file indicates that, on the date the elector signed the recall petition, the elector was not registered to vote in the city or township designated on the recall petition, there is a rebuttable presumption that the signature is invalid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The qualified voter file shall be used to determine the genuineness of a challenged petition signature appearing on a recall petition. Signature comparisons shall be made with the digitized signature in the qualified voter file. If the qualified voter file does not contain a digitized signature of an elector, the official with whom the recall petition was filed shall compare the challenged signature to the signature on the master card.</div>
