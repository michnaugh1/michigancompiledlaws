</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>117.3 Mandatory charter provisions.</B><P>Sec. 3.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Each city charter shall provide for all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The election of a mayor, who shall be the chief executive officer of the city, and of a body vested with legislative power, and for the election or appointment of a clerk, a treasurer, an assessor or board of assessors, a board of review, and other officers considered necessary. The city charter may provide for the selection of the mayor by the legislative body. Elections may be by a partisan, nonpartisan, or preferential ballot, or by any other legal method of voting. Notwithstanding another law or charter provision to the contrary, a city having a 1970 official population of more than 150,000, whose charter provides for terms of office of less than 4 years, and in which the term of office for the mayor and the governing body are of the same length, may provide by ordinance for a term of office of up to 4 years for mayor and other elected city officials. The ordinance shall provide that the ordinance shall take effect 60 days after it is enacted unless within the 60 days a petition is submitted to the city clerk signed by not less than 10% of the registered electors of the city requesting that the question of approval of the ordinance be submitted to the electors at the next regular election or a special election called for the purpose of approving or disapproving the ordinance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The nomination of elective officers by partisan or nonpartisan primary, by petition, or by convention.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) The time, manner, and means of holding elections and the registration of electors, subject to section 26 and other applicable requirements of law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The qualifications, duties, and compensation of the city's officers. If the city has an appointed chief administrative officer, the legislative body of the city may enter into an employment contract with the chief administrative officer extending beyond the terms of the members of the legislative body unless the employment contract is prohibited by the city charter. An employment contract with a chief administrative officer shall be in writing and shall specify the compensation to be paid to the chief administrative officer, any procedure for changing the compensation, any fringe benefits, and other conditions of employment. The contract shall state if the chief administrative officer serves at the pleasure of the legislative body, and the contract may provide for severance pay or other benefits in the event the chief administrative officer's employment is terminated at the pleasure of the legislative body.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) The establishment of 1 or more wards, and if the members of the city's legislative body are chosen by wards, for equal representation for each ward in the legislative body.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) That the subjects of taxation for municipal purposes are the same as for state, county, and school purposes under the general law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) The annual laying and collecting taxes in a sum, except as otherwise provided by law, not to exceed 2% of the taxable value of the real and personal property in the city. Unless the charter provides for a different tax rate limitation, the governing body of a city may levy and collect taxes for municipal purposes in a sum not to exceed 1% of the taxable value of the real and personal property in the city. As used in this subdivision, "taxable value" is that value determined under section 27a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.27a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) An annual appropriation of money for municipal purposes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) The levy, collection, and return of state, county, and school taxes in conformance with the general laws of this state, except that the preparation of the assessment roll, the meeting of the board of review, and the confirmation of the assessment roll may be at the times provided in the city charter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(j) The public peace and health and for the safety of persons and property. In providing for the public peace, health, and safety, a city may expend funds or enter into contracts with a private organization, the federal or state government, a county, village, or township, or another city for services considered necessary by the legislative body. Public peace, health, and safety services may include the operation of child guidance and community mental health clinics, the prevention, counseling, and treatment of developmental disabilities, the prevention of drug abuse, and the counseling and treatment of drug abusers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(k) Adopting, continuing, amending, and repealing the city ordinances and for the publication of each ordinance before it becomes operative. Whether or not provided in its charter, instead of publishing a true copy of an ordinance before it becomes operative, the city may publish a summary of the ordinance. If the city publishes a summary of the ordinance, the city shall include in the publication the designation of a location in the city where a true copy of the ordinance can be inspected or obtained. A charter provision to the contrary notwithstanding, a city may adopt an ordinance punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $500.00, or both, if the violation substantially corresponds to a violation of state law that is a misdemeanor for which the maximum period of imprisonment is 93 days. Whether or not provided in its charter, a city may adopt a provision of a state statute for which the maximum period of imprisonment is 93 days or the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.1 to 257.923. Except as otherwise provided under the Stille-DeRossett-Hale single state construction code act, 1972 PA 230, MCL 125.1501 to 125.1531, a city may adopt a law, code, or rule that has been promulgated and adopted by an authorized agency of this state pertaining to fire, fire hazards, fire prevention, or fire waste, and a fire prevention code, plumbing code, heating code, electrical code, building code, refrigeration machinery code, piping code, boiler code, boiler operation code, elevator machinery code, an international property maintenance code, or a code pertaining to flammable liquids and gases or hazardous chemicals, that has been promulgated or adopted by this state, by a department, board, or other agency of this state, or by an organization or association that is organized and conducted for the purpose of developing the code, by reference to the law, code, or rule in an adopting ordinance and without publishing the law, code, or rule in full. The law, code, or rule shall be clearly identified in the ordinance and its purpose shall be published with the adopting ordinance. Printed copies of the law, code, or rule shall be kept in the office of the city clerk, available for inspection by, and distribution to, the public at all times. The publication shall contain a notice stating that a complete copy of the law, code, or rule is made available to the public at the office of the city clerk in compliance with state law requiring that records of public bodies be made available to the general public. Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, a city shall not enforce a provision adopted by reference for which the maximum period of imprisonment is greater than 93 days. A city may adopt section 625(1)(c) of the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.625, by reference in an adopting ordinance and shall provide that a violation of that ordinance is punishable by 1 or more of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Community service for not more than 360 hours.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) Imprisonment for not more than 180 days.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) A fine of not less than $200.00 or more than $700.00.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(l) That the business of the legislative body shall be conducted at a public meeting held in compliance with the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275. All records of the municipality shall be made available to the general public in compliance with the freedom of information act, 1976 PA 442, MCL 15.231 to 15.246.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(m) Keeping in the English language a written or printed journal of each session of the legislative body.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(n) A system of accounts that conforms to a uniform system of accounts as required by law.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A city that has a population of not less than 750,000 as determined by the most recent federal decennial census and that has a city council composed of 9 at-large council members shall place a question in substantially the following form on the ballot at the general primary election held on Tuesday, August 6, 2002:
<B></B><table>
    <tr>
      <td>
      </td>
      <td>"Shall
  the existing 9-member at-large city council be abolished, shall the city be
  reapportioned into 9 single-member election districts, and shall district
  residency requirements be imposed on candidates for the city council?</td>

      <td>
      </td>
      <td>No
  (_____).".</td>
    </tr>
  </table><B></B>(2) The result of the vote shall be canvassed by the local board of canvassers under the Michigan election law, 1954 PA 116, MCL 168.1 to 168.992.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) If the question presented pursuant to subsection (1) is approved, the 9-member at-large city council is abolished on January 1, 2006 and shall be replaced by a city council of 9 members elected from single-member election districts at regular municipal elections beginning with the municipal primary election in 2005. Any charter provision to the contrary notwithstanding, the president of the city council shall be determined by a majority vote of the city council members elected and serving from single-member election districts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Within 30 days after the question presented pursuant to subsection (1) is approved, the city redistricting commission shall meet as the apportionment commission and adopt an apportionment plan. The city redistricting commission shall consist of 3 members, 2 of whom are appointed by the mayor and 1 of whom is appointed by the city council. The city redistricting commission shall thereafter meet within 30 days after the publication of the latest official figures of the federal decennial census to reapportion the city. To the extent consistent with this act, the procedural aspects of the apportionment process shall be governed by the same statutory procedures as those provided for a county charter commission apportionment pursuant to section 5(4), (5), (6), and (7) of 1966 PA 293, MCL 45.505. One of the 2 members appointed by the mayor under this subsection shall convene the city redistricting commission, sitting as the apportionment commission. As the apportionment commission, the city redistricting commission shall adopt its own rules of procedure. Two members shall constitute a quorum and all actions shall be by a majority vote.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The city redistricting commission shall provide for equal representation for each single-member election district, and each single-member election district shall be as nearly equal in population and compact as is practicable based on the latest federal decennial census. In developing an apportionment plan, the city redistricting commission shall follow the lines used for planning sectors and subcommittees as provided by the city master plan and charter. In subsequent reapportionments, the city redistricting commission apportionment plan shall make only incremental changes to the single-member election district boundaries that are necessary to accommodate population change requirements. Each single-member election district shall be designated by number.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) Each candidate for city council shall be a resident of the single-member election district he or she seeks to represent. A city council member's office is vacated if the member moves his or her residence outside of the single-member election district that the member represents.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) To comply with and implement this section, the city clerk shall promulgate necessary election rules and procedures consistent with other provisions of the city charter. The city council may amend the charter to comply with the intent and findings of this section in the same manner provided by law and charter for the adoption of an ordinance. However, any charter amendment to comply with the intent and findings of this section shall take effect immediately upon adoption by the council. The city clerk shall file a copy of any charter amendment with the secretary of state and the county clerk of the county in which the city is located. Sections 21 to 25 do not apply to the charter amendment required under this section.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>Each city may in its charter provide for any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For the purchase or condemnation of franchises, if any exist, and of the property used in the operation of companies or individuals engaged in the road, cemetery, hospital, almshouse, electric light, gas, heat, water, and power business, and in cities having more than 25,000 inhabitants, for the purchase of the franchise, if any exist, and the property of street railway and tram railway companies. A city may in its charter allow for a contract, upon the terms, including terms of present or deferred payment, and upon the conditions and in the manner as the city considers proper, to purchase, operate, and maintain any existing public utility property for supplying water, heat, light, power, or transportation to the city and the city's inhabitants. The contract does not bind the city unless the proposition for the contract receives the affirmative vote of 3/5 of the electors voting at a regular or special election. For the purchase of a transportation utility, the charter amendment and the contract to purchase may provide for a sinking fund, into which must be paid, from the earnings of the utility, sums sufficient to purchase the utility and perform the obligations of the contract. Within a reasonable time after the acquisition of a public transportation utility, a system of civil service for the selection and retention of its employees must be established. If a vote is taken to amend a city charter to allow an acquisition under this subdivision, a vote may also be taken at the same election to approve a particular contract. The vote upon the charter amendment and upon the purchase contract must be by separate ballots. If a transportation utility is acquired under this subdivision, state taxes and local taxes on any portion of the property lying outside of the city limits must be paid as if privately owned. The powers under this subdivision are in addition to any other powers provided for under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) For owning, constructing, and operating transportation facilities within the city limits, and its adjacent and adjoining suburbs within a distance of 10 miles from any portion of the city limits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) For the purchase and condemnation of private property for any public use or purpose within the scope of its powers; for the acquirement, ownership, establishment, construction, and operation, either within or outside its corporate limits, of public utilities for supplying water, light, heat, power, and transportation to the city and the city's inhabitants, for domestic, commercial, and municipal purposes; for the sale of heat, power, and light outside its corporate limits in an amount as determined by the governing body of the utility supplying the heat, power, or light except that electric delivery service is limited to the area of any village or township that was contiguous to the city as of June 20, 1974, and to the area of any other village or township being served as of June 20, 1974 and retail sales of electric generation service are limited to the area of any city, village, or township that was contiguous to the city, village, or township as of June 20, 1974, and to the area of any other city, village, or township being served as of June 20, 1974; for the sale and delivery of water outside of its corporate limits in the amount as may be determined by the legislative body of the city; and for the operation of transportation lines outside the city and within 10 miles from its corporate limits. A city shall not render electric delivery service for heat, power, or light outside its corporate limits to a customer that is currently receiving or within the previous 3 years has received that service from another utility unless that utility consents in writing. The acquirement of a utility together with all properties, franchises, and rights necessary for its establishment, ownership, construction, operation, improvement, extension, and maintenance, whether the properties, franchises, and rights are situated within or outside the corporate limits of the city, may be either by purchase or condemnation. If the acquirement is by condemnation, 1911 PA 149, MCL 213.21 to 213.25, may be used for instituting and prosecuting the condemnation proceedings. A public utility is not acquired unless the proposition to do so first receives the affirmative vote of 3/5 of the electors of the city voting at a regular or special municipal election. As used in this subdivision:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) "Customer" means only the building or facilities served rather than the individual, association, partnership, corporation, governmental body, or any other entity taking service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(ii) "Electric delivery service" has the same meaning as "delivery service" under section 10y of 1939 PA 3, MCL 460.10y.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(iii) "Electric generation service" means the sale of electric power and related ancillary services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) For the acquiring, establishment, operation, extension, and maintenance of sewage disposal systems, sewers, and plants, either within or outside the corporate limits of the city, as a utility, including the right to acquire necessary property by purchase, gift, or condemnation, and including the fixing and collecting of charges exclusively for service covering the cost of the service. This subdivision allows a return on the fair value of the property devoted to the service, excluding the valuations of the portions of the system that were paid for by special assessment, which may be made as a lien upon the property served and if not paid when due, collected in the same manner as other city taxes.</div>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Each city may in its charter provide:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   For the acquisition by construction, condemnation or purchase and for the ownership, equipment, possession, leasing, operation and maintenance of a rapid transit system consisting of a tunnel, subway, surface or elevated system or any combination and qualification of these, in and through said city, and for a distance of not more than 10 miles beyond its limits, for the purpose of furnishing transportation facilities to the municipality and to the people thereof; for the preparation and publication of plans for such construction, equipment and maintenance in accordance with charter provisions adopted hereunder; for the operation of such facilities independently or in connection with other transportation facilities, or transportation system, owned, operated or controlled by such city or existing therein, or in the territory in which any such rapid transit system is established; for the appropriate designation of such facilities; for the taking of the fee of or easement or right of way on, under, above and through any property for the purposes thereof, by gift, grant and purchase, and by condemnation proceedings in accordance with any law of the state of Michigan providing therefor; and for the management of such facilities, for the purposes for which the same are or may be acquired or constructed. Provision may also be made for the execution of contracts incidental to the carrying out of the purposes hereby contemplated. In the event that property is taken by condemnation under any statute pertaining thereto, the actual benefits accruing to or received by a remainder of any such parcel on account of the construction of the improvement shall be taken into account in determining the damages to be awarded by way of compensation to the owner or owners of such property. The charter shall also provide for the proper financing of the acquisition and construction of any such system and facilities by direct taxation, special assessments on the basis of benefits actually and exclusively received by property affected by any such improvement, or by borrowing money and issuing bonds or other evidence of indebtedness therefor, or by a combination of such methods; and for the defraying of the cost of maintenance, operation and management of such facilities and for payment of interest on and a sinking fund to retire any bonds issued under this subsection, from the revenues received as a result of the operation thereof by the city. Bonds executed and sold for the purpose of raising money to cover the cost of such acquisition and construction may be issued on the faith and credit of the city or same may be secured by mortgage on the property and revenues of the utility established pursuant hereto. The aggregate amount of bonds issued on the faith and credit of the city under this subsection shall not exceed 2 per cent of the assessed valuation of the taxable property within said city for the preceding fiscal year; and in computing the total indebtedness of the city for the purpose of determining whether any other limitation prescribed by law has been exceeded, such bonds shall not be included. Except as is in this subsection otherwise specifically provided, all bonds issued by a city for the purposes hereby contemplated shall be subject to the restrictions and conditions prescribed in section 4-a of this act. In case provision is made in the charter for raising money by direct taxation for the purposes hereof, the amount of such tax levied and assessed in any year shall not exceed 1/6 of 1 per cent of the assessed valuation of the city for such year; and the amount of any such tax shall not be subject to any other limitations prescribed by law, or considered in determining whether any such limitation has been exceeded. In no case shall more than 60 per cent of the total estimated cost of acquiring or constructing any such rapid transit system or portion of extension thereof, be raised by direct taxation, and by the issuance of bonds on the faith and credit of the city. As incidental to the authority hereby granted, provision may be made in any city charter for the exercise of powers incidental to the accomplishment of the purposes hereof, and reasonably calculated and designed to facilitate the furnishing of adequate transportation facilities by the means aforesaid to the municipality and the people thereof. No charter amendment or amendments, contemplating and providing for the exercise of the powers referred to in this subsection, shall be submitted to a vote of the electors unless and until the same shall have been published pursuant to the direction of the legislative body of the city, in at least 1 newspaper having a general circulation in such city at least once each week for 3 weeks in succession during the 30 day period immediately preceding the date of the election; and no plan for construction and operation of any rapid transit system shall be put into effect unless the same shall first have been submitted to the qualified electors of the city and approved thereby. Such submission of plan shall be made subsequent to the enactment of said charter amendments either at a general election or a special election called for that purpose by the legislative body of the city. Such contemplated plan shall, before its submission, and as a condition prerequisite thereto, be published once each week for 6 weeks in succession in some daily newspaper having a general circulation within the city, during the 60-day period immediately preceding the date of submission to the electors; and the contemplated plan as so published shall specify the route or routes of the proposed rapid transit system, the type of construction proposed for the various sections or parts thereof, the method or methods for financing the improvement, the order in which the various sections or parts are to be constructed or acquired, the system of management to be adopted, the estimated cost of the various sections or parts of the system, and such other matters as the legislative body of the city shall require: Provided, however, That the financial plan so submitted shall not permit special assessments against any property in excess of actual benefits, meaning increased value, accruing exclusively as a result of said improvement; and the payment of such special assessments made under this subsection, shall be prorated over a period of not less than 10 years.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   For negotiating, executing and performing contracts with any other municipality or municipalities, duly authorized and empowered to that end, with reference to the construction, equipment, operation, maintenance and management of a rapid transit system and facilities, and for the financing of any obligations, assumed under or imposed by any such contract. The grants, limitations and restrictions set forth in the preceding subsection of this section shall be deemed applicable to, and shall be observed in the adoption of, charter provisions and amendments hereunder and in the exercise of the authority hereby granted.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The landlord is given a written correction notice of the violation and a reasonable opportunity to correct the circumstances before a reinspection of the premises or a date specified in the notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The violation is a direct result of the landlord's action or inaction and creates an emergency that presents an immediate risk of harm to people or damage to property including, but not limited to, a flooded basement or premises without heat.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A city that does not have a rental inspection program, or does not require a landlord to register as part of a rental inspection program, shall not issue a blight violation notice to a landlord of premises rented in the city for residential purposes during an inspection of the premises unless either of the following occurs:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) The person named in the violation notice shall appear on or before the time specified in the violation notice and may respond to the allegations in the notice, as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) If the alleged violator wishes to admit responsibility for the blight violation, the person may do so by appearing in person, by representation, or by mail.

Upon acceptance of the admission, a hearing officer may order any of the sanctions permitted under this section.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) If the alleged violator wishes to deny responsibility for the blight violation, or admit responsibility with an explanation, the person may do so by appearing in person on the date scheduled for the administrative hearing for the purpose of adjudicating the alleged violation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) If the alleged violator fails to appear, a decision and order of default may be entered.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) If an admission of responsibility is not made and the civil fine and costs, if any, prescribed by charter or ordinance for the violation are not paid at the administrative hearings bureau, and the alleged violator fails to appear at a hearing scheduled in accordance with this section, a final decision and order of responsibility in the amount of the prescribed civil fine and costs may be issued by the administrative hearings bureau.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) The city establishing an administrative hearings bureau shall establish rules and procedures for an alleged violator to set aside the entry of a decision and order of default.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) The ordinance establishing the bureau shall provide for adjudicatory hearings by hearing officers. Each hearing officer shall be an attorney licensed to practice law in this state for at least 5 years. Hearing officers shall be appointed in a manner consistent with the charter of the city for the appointment of other municipal officers or employees and shall only be removed for reasonable cause. Before conducting administrative adjudication proceedings, administrative hearing officers shall successfully complete a formal training program which includes all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Instruction on the rules of procedure of the administrative hearings that they will conduct.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Orientation to each subject area of the ordinance violations that they will adjudicate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Observation of administrative hearings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Participation in hypothetical cases, including ruling on evidence and issuing final orders.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Instructions on the preparation of a record that is adequate for judicial review.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) The authority and duties of a hearing officer shall include all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Hearing testimony and accepting evidence that is relevant to the existence of the blight violation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Issuing subpoenas directing witnesses to appear and give relevant testimony at the hearing, upon request of a party or a party's attorney.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Preserving and authenticating the record of the hearing and all exhibits and evidence introduced at the hearing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Issuing a determination, based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, whether a blight violation exists. The determination shall be in writing and shall include written findings of fact, a decision, and an order. The city shall have the burden of establishing the responsibility of the alleged violator by a preponderance of the evidence. Unless the burden is met, the matter shall be dismissed. A decision and an order shall not be made except upon consideration of the record as a whole or a portion of the record as may be cited by any party to the proceeding and as supported by and in accordance with the competent, material, and substantial evidence. A decision and order finding the alleged violator responsible for the violation shall include the civil fine, if any, or any action with which the violator must comply, or both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Imposing reasonable and proportionate sanctions consistent with applicable ordinance provisions and assessing costs upon a finding that the alleged violator is responsible for the alleged violation. The maximum monetary civil fine allowed under this section excludes costs of enforcement or costs imposed to secure compliance with the city's ordinances and is not applicable to enforce the collection of any tax imposed and collected by the city.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) In addition to fines and costs imposed under subsection (12), the hearing officer shall impose a justice system assessment of $10.00 for each blight violation determination. Upon payment of the assessment, the city shall transmit the assessment collected to the state treasury to be deposited into the justice system fund created in section 181 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.181.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) A party shall be provided with the opportunity for a hearing during which they may be represented by counsel, present witnesses, and cross-examine witnesses. A party may request the hearing officer to issue subpoenas to direct the attendance and testimony of relevant witnesses and the production of relevant documents. Hearings shall be scheduled with reasonable promptness, except that for hearings scheduled in all nonemergency situations the alleged violator if he or she requests shall have at least 14 days after service of process to prepare for the hearing. For purposes of this subsection, "nonemergency situation" means any situation that does not reasonably constitute a threat to the public interest, safety, or welfare. If service is provided by first-class mail, the 14-day period begins to run on the day that the notice is deposited in the mail.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(15) In an administrative hearing under this section, the rules of evidence as applied in a nonjury civil case in circuit court shall be followed as far as practicable, but the hearing officer may admit and give probative effect to evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded. Effect shall be given to the rules of privilege recognized by law. Objections to offers of evidence may be made and shall be noted in the record. Subject to these requirements, the hearing officer, for the purpose of expediting hearings and when the interests of the parties will not be substantially prejudiced thereby, may provide in an administrative hearing or by rule for submission of all or part of the evidence in written form.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(16) Any final decision by a hearing officer that a blight violation does or does not exist constitutes a final decision and order for purposes of judicial review and may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(17) A party may file an appeal within 28 days after entry of the decision and order by the hearing officer. An appeal of a final decision and order of an administrative hearing officer is to the circuit court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(18) An alleged violator who appeals a final decision and order to circuit court shall post with the administrative hearings bureau, at the time the appeal is taken, a bond equal to the fine and costs imposed. A party who has paid the fine and costs is not required to post a bond. If a party who has posted a bond fails to comply with the requirements of supreme court rules for an appeal to the circuit court, the appeal may be considered abandoned, and the bureau may dismiss the appeal on 7 days' notice to the parties. The administrative hearings bureau must promptly notify the circuit court of a dismissal, and the circuit court shall dismiss the claim of appeal. If the appeal is dismissed or the decision and order are affirmed, the administrative hearings bureau may apply the bond to the fine and costs. An appeal by the city must be asserted by the city's attorney and a bond is not required.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(19) An appeal to circuit court shall be a review by the court of the certified record provided by the administrative hearings bureau. Pending appeal, and subject to the bond requirement under subsection (18), the hearing officer may stay the order and any sanctions or costs imposed. Once an appeal is filed, and subject to the bond requirement under subsection (18), the court may stay the order and any sanctions or costs imposed. The court, as appropriate, may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision or order, or remand the matter for further proceedings. The court shall hold unlawful and set aside a decision or order of the hearing officer if substantial rights of an alleged violator have been prejudiced because the decision or order is any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) In violation of the constitution or a statute, charter, or ordinance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) In excess of the authority or jurisdiction of the agency as conferred by statute, charter, or ordinance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Made upon unlawful procedure resulting in material prejudice to a party.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Not supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Arbitrary, capricious, or clearly an abuse or unwarranted exercise of discretion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) Affected by other substantial and material error of law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(20) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (21) or (22), if the civil fine and costs imposed against a person under this section are $1,000.00 or more and the person does not pay the civil fine and costs imposed within 30 days after a final decision and order of the hearing officer or of the circuit court under this section, the person is subject to the following: </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) If a defendant does not pay a civil fine or costs or an installment payment ordered by a hearing officer under section 4q within 30 days after the date on which payment is due for a blight violation involving the use or occupation of land or a building or other structure, the city may obtain a lien against the land, building, or structure involved in the violation by recording a copy of the final decision and order requiring payment of the fines or costs with the register of deeds for the county in which the land, building, or structure is located. The order shall not be recorded unless a legal description of the property is incorporated in or attached to the order. The lien is effective immediately upon recording of the order with the register of deeds.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) An order recorded with a register of deeds under subsection (1) constitutes notice of the pendency of the lien. In addition, the city shall send a written notice of the lien by first-class mail to the owner of record of the land, building, or structure at the owner's last known address.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A lien under this section may be enforced and discharged by the city in the manner prescribed by its charter, in the same manner as are liens for delinquent taxes under the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, or by an ordinance duly passed by the governing body of the city. However, property that is exempt as a principal residence under section 7cc of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.7cc, is not subject to forfeiture, foreclosure, and sale under sections 78 to 79a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.78 to 211.79a, for nonpayment of a civil fine or costs or an installment ordered under section 4q unless the property is also subject to forfeiture, foreclosure, and sale under sections 78 to 79a of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.78 to 211.79a, for delinquent property taxes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) A lien created under this section has priority over any other lien unless 1 or more of the following apply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) The other lien is a lien for taxes or special assessments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The other lien is created before May 1, 1994.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Federal law provides that the other lien has priority.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) The other lien is recorded before the lien under this section is recorded.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A city may institute an action in circuit court for the collection of a judgment imposed by an order under section 4q for a blight violation. However, an attempt by the city to collect the judgment by any process does not invalidate or waive the lien upon the land, building, or structure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A lien under this section expires 10 years after a copy of the order imposing a fine or costs, or both, is recorded, unless within that time an action to enforce the lien is commenced.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A default in the payment of a civil fine or costs under section 4q or an installment of the fine or costs may be collected by a means authorized for the enforcement of a court judgment under chapter 40 or 60 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.4001 to 600.4065, and MCL 600.6001 to 600.6098.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) A city shall not commence an action to enforce a lien under this section if the city has commenced an action for a writ of garnishment with respect to the unpaid fine, costs, or payment under section 4027 of the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.4027.</div>

</font><BR><SMALL></SMALL><BR><BR><BR><B>117.5 Prohibited powers.</B><P>Sec. 5.</P>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A city does not have power to do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) To increase the rate of taxation now fixed by law, unless the authority to do so is given by a majority of the electors of the city voting at the election at which the proposition is submitted, but the increase in any case shall not be in an amount as to cause the rate to exceed 2%, except as provided by law, of the assessed value of the real and personal property in the city.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) To submit to the electors a charter more often than once in every 2 years, nor unless the charter is filed with the city clerk 60 days before the election, but this provision shall not apply to the submission and resubmission of charters of cities that may be incorporated under this act until they shall have first adopted a charter. Where a city submits to the electors a charter and the charter is adopted by the electors, and the city has operated under the charter, which charter has not, at the time it is adopted, been on file with the city clerk 60 days, then the legislative body of the city, upon its giving the notice of election as provided in the charter, may resubmit to the electors, at a special or general election, the charter, which, if adopted by the electors, shall be considered operative and effective as of the date of the first submission and adoption. The charter shall not be resubmitted unless 60 days have elapsed between the date of the filing of the charter and the date of the election at which the charter is resubmitted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) To call more than 2 special elections within 1 year. This prohibition does not apply to elections that may be held in the submission and resubmission of charters of cities that may be incorporated under this act until they have first adopted a charter, and does not apply to elections that may be held in the resubmission of a charter once adopted as provided in subdivision (b).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) To decrease the salary of a municipal judge after his or her election or appointment, or during the judge's term of office, notwithstanding any charter provision to the contrary. The term of a public official shall not be shortened or extended beyond the period for which the official is elected or appointed, unless he or she resigns or is removed for cause, if the office is held for a fixed term.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) To adopt a charter or an amendment to the charter unless approved by a majority of the electors voting on the question; to sell a park, cemetery, or any part of a park or cemetery, except where the park is not required under an official master plan of the city; to engage in a business enterprise requiring an investment of money in excess of 10 cents per capita; or to authorize an issue of bonds except bonds issued in anticipation of the collection of taxes actually levied and uncollected or for which an appropriation has been made; bonds that the city is authorized by its charter to issue as part of its budget system, to an amount that in any year, together with the taxes levied for the same year, will not exceed the limit of taxation authorized by law; special assessment bonds; bonds for the city's portion of local improvements; refunding bonds; emergency bonds as defined by this act; and bonds that the legislative body is authorized by specific statute to issue without vote of the electors, unless approved by a majority of the electors voting on the question at a general or special election. In addition, a city that now has, or may subsequently have, a population of 750,000 persons or more may issue bonds, upon resolution of its governing body, without prior approval of the electors, which the city is authorized by its charter to issue as part of its budget system, to an amount that in any year, together with the ad valorem taxes levied for the same year, exclusive of debt service taxes or taxes levied pursuant to other laws, will not exceed 2-1/2% of the assessed value of the real and personal property in the city, this limitation to supersede and take the place of any contrary language in any existing city charter. For the purposes of this subdivision only, the assessed value of real and personal property in any city shall include the assessed value equivalent of money received during the city's fiscal year under the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921. The assessed value equivalent shall be calculated by dividing the money received by the city's millage rate for the fiscal year. Notwithstanding the former provisions of this subdivision requiring approval by 3/5 of the electors voting on the question as a prerequisite to the exercise of certain powers, these powers may be exercised if approved by a majority of the electors voting on the question at a general or special election held on or after April 1, 1966.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(f) To make a contract with, or give an official position to, one who is in default to the city.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(g) To issue bonds without providing a sinking fund to pay them at maturity, except as provided in section 4g(1), but sinking funds shall not be required in the case of serial bonds that fall due annually. Bonds, whether authorized under this act or any other act, except refunding bonds, revenue bonds, motor vehicle highway fund bonds, rehabilitation bonds, judgment bonds, bonds or other obligations issued to fund an operating deficit of a city, bonds or other obligations to pay premiums or to establish funds to self-insure for losses as authorized by the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821, bonds the issuance of which has been approved by the voters, and bonds issued to comply with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be issued by a city unless notice of the issuance of the bonds is published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least 45 days before the issuance of the bonds, within which period a petition may be filed with the legislative body signed by not less than 10% or 15,000 of the registered electors in the city, whichever is less, in which event the legislative body shall submit the question of the issuance of the bonds to the electors of the city, at a regular or special election in the city. The bonds shall not be issued unless a majority vote of the electors voting on the issuance vote in favor of issuing the bonds. The notice of intent to issue bonds shall state the maximum amount of the bond issue, the purpose of the bond issuance, source of payment, right of referendum on the issuance of the bonds, and other information as the legislative body determines to be necessary to adequately inform the electors and all other interested persons of the nature of the issue and of their rights with respect to the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(h) To repudiate a debt by a change in its charter or by consolidation with any other municipality.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) To submit a franchise to the electors at a special election, unless the expense of holding the election, as determined by the legislative body, is paid in advance to the city treasurer by the grantee in the franchise.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Beginning on the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection, a city shall not adopt a city charter or ordinance that includes any minimum staffing requirement for city employees. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any provision in a city charter or ordinance adopted on or after the effective date of the amendatory act that added this subsection that contains a minimum staffing requirement for city employees is void and unenforceable.</div>

</P>
<P>Sec. 5c.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In place of a charter provision existing on December 31, 1972 establishing the salaries or the procedure for determining salaries of elected officials, the governing body may establish, by ordinance, the procedure described in this section, in which case the restriction contained in a charter provision with respect to changing salaries during term shall be inapplicable. The ordinance shall provide the following:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   A local officers compensation commission is created which shall determine the salaries of each local elected official. The commission shall consist of 5 members in a city of 20,000 population or less and 7 members in a city of over 20,000 population. The members shall be registered electors of the city, appointed by the mayor subject to confirmation by a majority of the members elected and serving in the legislative body. In the case of a 5-member commission, the terms of office shall be 5 years, except that of the members first appointed, 1 each shall be appointed for terms of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. In the case of a 7-member commission, the terms of office shall be 7 years, except that of the members first appointed, 1 each shall be appointed for terms of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 years. The first members shall be appointed within 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance. Members other than the first members shall be appointed before October 1 of the year of appointment. Vacancies shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term. A member or employee of the legislative, judicial, or executive branch of government or a member of the immediate family of a member or employee of the legislative, judicial, or executive branch of government shall not be a member of the commission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The commission shall determine the salary of each local elected official. The determination shall be the salary unless the legislative body, by resolution adopted by 2/3 of the members elected to and serving on the legislative body, rejects it. The determination of the commission shall be effective 30 days following its filing with the city clerk unless rejected by the legislative body. If the determination is rejected, the existing salary shall prevail. The expense allowance or reimbursement paid to elected officials in addition to salary shall be for expenses incurred in the course of city business and accounted for to the city.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   The commission shall meet for not more than 15 session days in each odd numbered year and shall make its determination within 45 calendar days after its first meeting. A majority of the members of the commission constitutes a quorum for conducting the business of the commission. The commission shall not take action or make a determination without a concurrence of a majority of the members appointed and serving on the commission. The commission shall elect a chairperson from among its members. As used in this section, "session day" means a calendar day on which the commission meets and a quorum is present. The members of the commission shall not receive compensation, but shall be entitled to actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of official duties.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The business which the commission may perform shall be conducted at a public meeting of the commission held in compliance with Act No. 267 of the Public Acts of 1976, being sections 15.261 to 15.275 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. Public notice of the time, date, and place of the meeting of the commission shall be given in the manner required by Act No. 267 of the Public Acts of 1976.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   A writing prepared, owned, used, in the possession of, or retained by the commission in the performance of an official function shall be made available to the public in compliance with Act No. 442 of the Public Acts of 1976, being sections 15.231 to 15.246 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The governing body shall implement this section by resolution. After 1 year following the date the ordinance goes into effect the procedure for establishing the compensation of elected officials may be changed by charter amendment or revision.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Not more than 60 days after the effective date of the ordinance, a petition for a referendum on the ordinance may be filed pursuant to the procedure provided in the charter or otherwise by filing a petition with the city clerk containing the signatures of at least 5% of the registered electors of the city on the effective date of the ordinance. The election shall be conducted in the same manner as an election on a charter amendment. If a petition for referendum is filed, a determination of the commission shall not be effective until the ordinance has been approved by the electors.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) The legislative body of a city may provide by resolution for the acquisition or financing of energy conservation improvements to be made to city facilities or infrastructure and may pay for the improvements or the financing or refunding of the improvements from the general fund of the city or from the savings that result from the energy conservation improvements. Energy conservation improvements may include, but are not limited to, heating, ventilating, or air-conditioning system improvements, fenestration improvements, roof improvements, the installation of any insulation, the installation or repair of heating, ventilating, or air-conditioning controls, entrance or exit way closures, information technology improvements associated with an energy conservation improvement, and municipal utility improvements associated with an energy conservation improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The legislative body of a city may acquire, finance, or refund 1 or more of the energy conservation improvements described in subsection (1) by installment contract, which may include a lease-purchase agreement described in subsection (5), or may borrow money and issue notes for the purpose of securing funds for the improvements or may enter into contracts in which the cost of the energy conservation improvements is paid from a portion of the savings that result from the energy conservation improvements. These contractual agreements may provide that the cost of the energy conservation improvements are paid only if the energy savings are sufficient to cover their cost. An installment contract, a lease-purchase agreement described in subsection (5), or notes issued pursuant to this subsection shall extend for a period of time not to exceed 20 years from the date of the final completion of the energy conservation improvements or the useful life of the aggregate energy conservation improvements, whichever is less. Notes issued pursuant to this subsection shall be full faith and credit, tax limited obligations of the city, payable from tax levies and the general fund as pledged by the legislative body of the city. The notes shall be subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821. A lease-purchase agreement issued pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821, and shall not be a municipal security or a debt as those terms are defined in that act. This subsection does not limit in any manner the borrowing or bonding authority of a city as provided by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Prior to entering into a contract for energy conservation improvements under this section, the legislative body of a city shall determine the following information and, within 60 days of the completion of the improvements, shall report the following information to the Michigan public service commission: </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Name of each facility to which an improvement is made and a description of the energy conservation improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Actual energy consumption during the 12-month period before commencement of the improvement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Project costs and expenditures, including the total of all lease payments over the duration of the lease-purchase agreement.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Estimated annual energy savings, including projected savings over the duration of the installment contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If energy conservation improvements are made as provided in this section, the legislative body of a city shall report to the Michigan public service commission, by July 1 of each of the 5 years after the improvements are completed, only the actual annual energy consumption of each facility to which improvements are made. The forms for the reports required by this section shall be furnished by the Michigan public service commission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) An installment contract described in this section may include a lease-purchase agreement, which may be a multiyear contractual obligation that provides for automatic renewal unless positive action is taken by the legislative body to terminate that contract. Payments under a lease-purchase agreement shall be a current operating expense subject to annual appropriations of funds by the legislative body and shall obligate the legislative body only for those sums payable during the fiscal year of contract execution or any renewal year thereafter. The legislative body may make payments under a lease-purchase agreement from any legally available funds or from a combination of energy or operational savings, capital contributions, future replacement costs avoided, or billable revenue enhancements that result from energy conservation improvements, provided that the legislative body has determined that those funds are sufficient to cover, in aggregate over the full term of the contractual agreement, the cost of the energy conservation improvements. The lease-purchase agreement will terminate immediately and absolutely and without further obligation on the part of the legislative body at the close of the fiscal year in which it was executed or renewed or at such time as appropriated and otherwise unobligated funds are no longer available to satisfy the obligations of the legislative body under the lease-purchase agreement. During the term of the lease-purchase agreement, the legislative body shall be the vested owner of the energy conservation improvements and may grant a security interest in the energy conservation improvements to the provider of the lease-purchase agreement. Upon the termination of the lease-purchase agreement and the satisfaction of the obligations of the legislative body, the provider of the lease-purchase agreement shall release its security interest in the energy conservation improvements.</div>

Such petition shall be verified by the oath of 1 or more petitioners. The county clerk upon the presentment of a petition for incorporation of a new city for filing shall forthwith estimate all necessary expense that may be incurred by the county in the incorporation proceedings, and the clerk thereupon shall require that the sum so estimated, which in no case shall exceed $500.00, be deposited with the clerk and shall refuse to accept the petition for filing until the sum is so deposited: Provided, That in proceedings for the incorporation of a new city or the consolidation of 2 or more cities or villages into 1 city, or of a city and 1 or more villages into 1 city or of 1 or more cities or villages together with additional territory not included within any incorporated city or village into 1 city, a petition signed by not less than 100 qualified electors who are freeholders residing within the territory so proposed to be incorporated or consolidated, praying for the taking of a census of the inhabitants of the territory affected thereby, may be filed with the county clerk of the county within which said territory is located. The county clerk shall, within 5 days after the filing of such petition, certify to the mayor of each city, president of each village, and supervisor of each township affected thereby, and to the secretary of state that such petition has so been filed. Within 5 days after the service of such certificate, the secretary of state shall appoint an enumerator or enumerators to enumerate the inhabitants of each such city, village, and the portion of each township proposed to be so incorporated, or a consolidation made thereof. Before entering upon the duties of said office, each such enumerator shall take and subscribe to the constitutional oath of office before some officer authorized to administer oaths and file the same with the secretary of state and with the county clerk of the county in which such territory is located. It shall be the duty of each enumerator so appointed to enumerate all of the bona fide inhabitants of such city, village, or township, territory or portion thereof assigned to the enumerator by the secretary of state and to visit each house or dwelling and to obtain the names of each known resident thereof. The city, village, or township within which the services of the enumerator are rendered shall pay for such services together with any actual and necessary expenses incurred by the enumerator. The rate of pay and actual and necessary expenses of the enumerator shall be set by the governing body of the city, village, or township in which the census takes place. Upon completing such enumeration it shall be the duty of the persons so appointed to make a return in duplicate of such enumeration showing the names of the inhabitants of each such city, village, or township, territory or district to the county clerk and to the secretary of state. No such enumeration or census shall be conducted in any city, village or township, or portion thereof, within 2 years of the date of the last enumeration in such territory. Every such enumeration shall be conducted under the general supervision and control of the secretary of state who is hereby empowered to make rules and regulations for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this act.</DIV>

The commission in processing and approving, denying, or revising a petition or resolution for annexation shall have the same powers and duties as provided under 1968 PA 191, MCL 123.1001 to 123.1020, relating to petitions which propose incorporations. In addition to providing notice to property owners located in the area proposed for annexation, the commission shall also give notice of each public hearing held under this subsection to property owners located within 300 feet of the area proposed for annexation by certified mail not less than 30 days before the date of the public hearing. Not less than 45 days before the date of the public hearing, the local unit of government capable of producing the information required under this section shall provide the state boundary commission with a list of the names and addresses of all persons the commission is required to provide notice to under this subsection. The commission is required to provide notice only to the property owners included on the list provided by the local unit of government as required under this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   If an annexation is denied by the commission, the commission shall send a certified copy of its order to the clerk of each county, city, village, and township affected.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If an annexation is approved, and if on the date the petition or resolution was filed 100 persons or less resided in the area approved for annexation, the commission's order shall not be subject to a referendum. The commission shall send a certified copy of its order to the clerk of each county, city, village, and township affected and to the secretary of state. The annexation shall be effective on a date set forth in the commission's order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   If an annexation is approved, and if on the date the petition or resolution was filed more than 100 persons resided in the area approved for annexation, the commission shall send a certified copy of its order to the clerk of each county, city, village, and township affected and to the secretary of state. The commission's order shall become final 30 days after the date of the order unless within that 30 days a petition is filed with the commission which contains the signatures of at least 25% of the registered electors residing in the portion of the territory approved for annexation, in the annexing city or in the balance of the township. The commission after verifying the validity of any referendum petition shall order that a referendum on the question of annexation be held in each area from which a valid petition was filed. If a valid petition is not filed within the 30 days or if the majority of the electorate voting on the question in each area in which a referendum was held, voting separately, approve the annexation, the annexation shall be effective on a date set by order of the commission, otherwise the annexation shall not take effect.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   The commission shall reject a petition or resolution for annexation of territory that includes all or any part of the territory which was described in any petition or resolution for annexation filed within the preceding 2 years and which was denied by the commission or was defeated in an election under subsection (5).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   In addition to the methods for initiating annexation as provided in this act, a petition or resolution as follows may be submitted to the state boundary commission in a form and manner prescribed by the commission:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   By resolution of the legislative body of the city to which the area is proposed to be annexed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   By petition by the persons, firms, corporations, the United States government, or the state or any of its subdivisions who collectively hold equitable title as a vendee under a recorded land contract or memorandum of land contract, or record title to 75% or more of the area of the land exclusive of streets in the territory proposed for annexation at the time of filing the petition.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   By petition by 20% of the registered electors who reside in the area proposed for annexation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)   Where the territory proposed to be annexed to any city is adjacent to the city and consists of a park or vacant property located in a township and owned by the city annexing the territory, and there is no one residing in the territory, the territory may be annexed to the city solely by resolution of the city council of the city. In any case where the territory proposed to be annexed is adjacent to the city and consists of property owned by the city or consists of fractional parts of platted subdivision lots, located in an adjoining city, village, or township, the annexation may also be accomplished by the majority vote of the legislative body of the city and the approval of the legislative body of the adjoining city, village, or township. As an alternate method, where there are no qualified electors residing in the territory proposed to be annexed to the city, other than the person or persons petitioning, a petition signed by a person or persons, firms, corporations, the United States government, or the state or any of its subdivisions who collectively hold the equitable title as a vendee under a recorded land contract or memorandum of land contract, or record legal title to more than 1/2 of the area of the land in the territory to be annexed is filed with the city council of the city and with the township board of the township in which the territory is situated, the annexation may be accomplished by the affirmative majority vote of the city council of the city and the approval of the township board of the township. At least 10 days prior to the approval by the township board, the township treasurer shall notify, personally or by registered mail with return receipt demanded, the owners of all real property in the territory to be annexed as shown on the assessment rolls of the township at the last known address on file with the township treasurer. Except as otherwise provided, this section shall not be construed to give any city the authority to attach territory from any other city unless the question relative to the territory has been voted upon by the voters of the entire cities affected where the territory proposed to be annexed is adjacent to a city and consists of property owned by the city or consists of fractional parts of platted subdivision lots, located in an adjoining city.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)   The provisions of section 14 shall not be applicable to an annexation approved by the commission of part of a township or village to a city except in the event of outstanding bonds or other evidences of indebtedness of the township or village. In such event, the commission shall determine and order an equitable division of assets and liabilities which relate to the bonds or other indebtedness.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)   The provisions of sections 8 and 8a shall not be applicable to petitions or resolutions filed with the state boundary commission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)   After March 31, 1971, and so long as 1968 PA 191, MCL 123.1001 to 123.1020, is in effect, annexation of territory from a township or village to a home rule city shall be as provided in this section and no other means of annexation shall be effective.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)   The state boundary commission shall mail a copy of any final order issued under this section to each property owner the commission is required to provide notice to under subsection (2).</DIV>

<P>Sec. 14.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whenever an incorporated village is incorporated as a city, without change of boundaries, such city shall succeed to the ownership of all the property of such village and shall assume all of its debts and liabilities. Whenever a city, village or township is annexed to a city, the city to which it is annexed shall succeed to the ownership of all the property of the city, village or township annexed, and shall assume all of its debts and liabilities. Whenever a part of a city, village or township is annexed to a city, the real property in the territory annexed which belongs to the city, village or township from which it is taken shall be sold by the authorities of the city, village or township in which said land was located before such annexation, and that portion of the proceeds of such sale shall be paid to the city acquiring such territory which shall be in the same ratio to the whole amount received as the assessed valuation of the taxable property in the territory annexed bears to the assessed valuation of the taxable property in the entire city, village or township from which said territory is taken. Whenever a part of a city, village or township is annexed to a city, all of the personal property belonging to any such city, village or township from which territory is detached shall be divided between the township, city or village from which said territory is detached and the city to which the territory is annexed, in the same ratio as the assessed valuation of the taxable property in the territory annexed bears to the assessed valuation of the taxable property in the entire city, village or township from which said territory is taken. Whenever a new city shall be incorporated, the personal property of the township from which it is taken shall be divided and its liabilities assumed between such city and the portion of the township remaining after such incorporation, which incorporation shall be effective as of the date of filing the certified copy of the charter as hereinafter provided, in the same ratio as herein provided in case of the annexation of a part of a township to a city, and any real property of a township located in such new city shall be held jointly by such city and the remaining portion of the township in the ratio above mentioned. Such real estate shall be subject to sale by agreement of the governmental units or may be partitioned in the manner provided by law for partitioning of lands held by persons as tenants in common: Provided, That no cemetery within such territory shall be sold; but to the extent it is owned by the city, village or township within which it is located, it shall become the property of the city to which it is annexed. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whenever a new city is incorporated from part of a township or townships, such city shall be entitled to its pro rata share of the amount thereafter due such township or townships or due any county agency in respect of population in such township or townships from any future distribution of gasoline and motor vehicle weight tax revenues, intangibles tax revenues, state alcoholic liquor tax revenues, or any other state funds, moneys or grants which, by law, now or hereafter, are required to be distributed among cities, villages, townships and/or counties of the state, which pro rata distribution shall be determined as follows, to-wit:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   According to the latest federal census prior to date of distribution but since such annexation, if there be such census, showing the respective population of the township or townships and the municipalities affected;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   In the absence of such federal census, an official special census shall be taken of the areas detached from each township to form the newly incorporated city and of the entire township or townships from which such area was detached. Such census shall be taken by enumerators appointed by the secretary of state upon application by any one of the municipalities affected by such incorporation, which census shall be taken, as near as may be, in accordance with the provisions of section 6 of this act; the ratio of population between the areas incorporated from each township to form the newly incorporated city and the remainder of the respective township or townships from which the city was incorporated, shall be the basis for determination of the pro rata share of the state funds, moneys or grants to be distributed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The township or townships from which such incorporated city is incorporated or the county agency receiving the funds, moneys or grants in respect of population in such township or townships shall be liable to the incorporated city for its proper pro rata share of any state funds, moneys or grants received by such township or townships or such county agency, respectively, after the date of incorporation;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In the absence of such federal census and in lieu of an official special census determining the respective populations of the municipalities affected by such incorporation, the newly incorporated city and each township from which the same was incorporated, may agree, by joint resolution, as to the prorating between them and between the city and any county agency receiving state funds, moneys or grants in respect of population in such township or townships of any funds, moneys or grants distributable by the state, a certified copy of which joint resolution shall be filed with the secretary of state and shall thereafter be binding upon all parties affected by said incorporation.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whenever a part of a city, village or township is annexed to a city, the city to which such territory is annexed shall be entitled to its proper pro rata share of any of the said state funds, moneys or grants thereafter distributable under the law to the city, village or township from which said territory was detached or to any county agency receiving state funds, moneys or grants in respect to population in such township or townships, determined as follows:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   According to ratio of population between the area annexed and the remainder of the township, city or village from which said area was detached, as determined by the latest official federal or state census showing such populations;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   If there be no official census by which said respective populations can be determined, then a census shall be taken of the territory detached and the remainder of the territory in the township, city or village from which it was detached as provided above in the case of a newly incorporated city;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   In the absence of such federal census and in lieu of taking an official special census, the city to which said territory was annexed and the cities, townships, or villages from which said territory was detached, may agree by joint resolution of their governing bodies as to the prorating of any such state funds, moneys, or grants between them and between the city and any county agency receiving said funds, moneys, or grants in respect to population in such township or townships as provided above in the case of a newly incorporated city, a certified copy of which joint resolution shall be filed with the secretary of state and shall thereafter be binding upon all parties to said incorporation. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The foregoing provisions shall be used hereafter in determining the pro rata distributions of any state funds, moneys or grants between townships or county agencies and any city which has become newly incorporated or annexed territory since the latest decennial federal census, either before or after the passing of this law; but in no event shall the sharing of any distribution of state funds, moneys or grants made previous to the effective date of this act be altered.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 14a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whenever the qualified electors of any city incorporated under the provisions of this act shall file a petition with the city clerk, which petition shall be addressed to the board of supervisors of the county in which the city is located, and signed by not less than 1/4 of the registered electors of such city as shown by the registration lists of the city on the date of such filing, praying that the incorporation of such city be vacated, the city clerk shall, after checking the signatures to such petition to determine their genuineness and sufficiency, refer the same to the county clerk of the county in which such city is located not less than 30 days before the convening of the board of supervisors in regular session: Provided, however, That no such petition may be initiated within 2 years of the effective date of incorporation of said city. Upon receipt of any such petition by any county clerk, the board of supervisors of such county, the county clerk, and the clerks of the city and township or townships affected shall be governed by and do and perform all acts required to be performed by them by sections 8, 9, 10 and 12 of this act with respect to calling and holding an election upon the question petitioned for, the same as though the question were upon the annexation of a part of a city to a township, except that the electors of the city and of the township to be affected shall each vote separately, unless 2 or more townships are to be affected, in which case the votes cast in all such townships shall be cumulated and the result of the election on such question in such townships determined by the total vote therein which is cast for and against such question. In case a 2/3 majority of the qualified electors of such city shall vote in favor of the vacation of the incorporation of the same and a majority of the qualified electors of the township or townships to be affected shall vote in favor of the annexation of the territory of such city to such township or townships, the county clerk shall, within 30 days after the canvass of such votes, make and certify 4 transcripts of all the proceedings in the matter and shall file 2 of such transcripts in the office of the secretary of state and the other 2 copies in his own office, and, upon such filing, the incorporation of such city shall be vacated and the territory thereof annexed to the township or townships from which such territory was detached at the time of the incorporation thereof and by subsequent annexations. Upon the vacation of the incorporation of any city, it shall be the duty of the officers of such city forthwith to deposit all books, papers, records and files relating to the organization of, or belonging or pertaining to such city, which are in their custody as such officers with the county clerk of the county in which such city is located, for safekeeping and reference. The assets of any city, the incorporation of which has been vacated, which have not been set aside or encumbered by the city for the payment of the funded debt or other outstanding obligations of the city, shall become the property of the township to which the territory of the city is annexed, or, if annexed to 2 or more townships, of said townships pro rata according to the assessed value of the portions of the city annexed to each of the townships as shown on the last assessment rolls of the city which were approved by the board of review of the city prior to the vacation of incorporation. The city clerk of such city shall certify to the board of supervisors of the county in which such city is located a statement of all outstanding debt and other obligations at the time the incorporation of such city was vacated, together with an accounting of all moneys on hand for the payment of such debt and other obligations. Said board of supervisors shall proceed to examine the same and shall pass a resolution authorizing the disbursement of such moneys and the assessment and collection of taxes within the area which had comprised the city for the purpose of paying such debt and other obligations in accordance with the conditions set forth in any bond or other instrument by which such debt or other obligations were incurred or secured. Assets of the city which had been set aside at the time of dissolution of incorporation for the payment of the debt or other obligations of the city shall be transferred to the township treasurer of the township to which the territory of such city is annexed or to which the largest portion of such city is annexed and shall be applied by him to the payment of such debt and other obligations in accordance with the conditions in any bond or other instrument by which such funds were set aside or encumbered. Upon the vacation or discontinuance of any city incorporation, under the preceding sections, the indebtedness of such city, whether bonded or otherwise, if any there be, shall be assessed, levied and collected upon the territory embraced within the boundaries of such city immediately prior to such vacation. It shall be the duty of the supervisor or supervisors of the township or townships in which the territory formerly embraced within the limits of any vacated city within 1 year from the date of the vacation of such city, except when such indebtedness falls due at some specified time, in which case such assessment shall be made so as to meet such indebtedness when the same falls due, to levy upon the assessment roll or rolls of his township upon the property formerly embraced within the limits of such city, the indebtedness of such city, or such portion of the same as shall be apportioned to the part of the territory formerly constituting such city as lies within his township as hereinafter provided. The taxes so assessed and levied shall be collected the same as other taxes, and shall be placed in a separate fund and applied to the payment of such indebtedness and the manner of the payment of such indebtedness shall be fixed by the board of supervisors in the resolution to be passed by said board for such purpose. For the purpose of paying the debt and other obligations of the city, as herein provided, the area comprising the city, the incorporation of which is sought to be vacated, shall constitute a de facto city for the purpose of assessing, levying, and collecting the taxes required therefor as a city tax, subject to the tax limitation provisions of the charter of such city and of the general law applicable thereto, and not as a township tax, notwithstanding the fact that the same are levied and spread upon the assessment rolls of any township. </DIV>

In case the electors shall, by a majority vote, declare in favor of such revision, a charter commission shall be elected within 60 days consisting of 9 electors of such city having a residence of at least 3 years in the municipality, or the legislative body by a 3/5 vote of the members elect or the initiatory petition may provide that the charter commission be selected at the same election at which the proposition to revise is submitted; the selection shall be void if the proposition to revise is not adopted. No city officer or employee, whether elected or appointed, shall be eligible to a place on the commission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   In the cities where provision is made by the city charter for the nonpartisan elections of city officers, the method prescribed for such elections shall apply in the election of charter commissioners.

The names of all candidates so nominated shall be placed upon a separate ballot at the election designated to be held for the election of a charter commission and without their party affiliations designated; the 9 candidates having the greatest number of votes shall be declared elected; the election of the members of such commission, except as herein specified, shall be conducted as near as may be as now provided by law for the election of city officers in the respective cities of this state unless special methods shall be otherwise provided in the charter of such city.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If the proposed revised charter is rejected by the electors of the city, the charter revision commission shall immediately reconvene and determine whether to take no further action, in which case it shall terminate and cease to exist, or whether to provide a revision of, or amendments to, the revised charter previously prepared by the commission.

A proposed revised charter, as originally submitted or resubmitted with amendments, shall be submitted not to exceed 3 times to the qualified electors of the city. If the charter is rejected 3 times, or if no revised charter is adopted during 3 years following the adoption of the proposition to revise, then the charter revision commission shall terminate and cease to exist. A new proposal to revise may be adopted at any time after termination of a charter revision commission.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   When the question of having a general revision of the charter shall be submitted to the electors of any city, the legislative body of such city or the initiative petitions may provide for the submission with such question for an advisory vote of the question of a change in the form of government of such city, or the question of continuing any power, limitation or provision granted to such city in a charter granted or passed by the legislature for the government thereof. When such advisory vote is requested in an initiatory petition, such question shall be submitted as hereinbefore provided. In the revision of the charter of any city, any power, limitation or provision granted to such city in any charter granted or passed by the legislature for the government of such city and contained in the charter to be revised may be included in such revised charter, and when so included, such power, limitation, or the effect of any such provision shall continue with the same force and effect as when granted or passed by the legislature in the first instance.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 21.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An amendment to an existing city charter, whether the charter was adopted under this act or formerly granted or passed by the legislature for the government of a city, may be proposed by the legislative body of a city on a 3/5 vote of the members-elect or by an initiatory petition. If the amendment is proposed by the legislative body of the city, the amendment shall be submitted to the electors of the city at the next regular municipal or general state election, or at a special election, held not less than 60 days after the proposal of the amendment. If the amendment is proposed by an initiatory petition, the amendment shall be submitted to the electors of the city at the next regular municipal or general state election held in the city not less than 90 days after the filing of the petition.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Proposed charter amendments and other questions to be submitted to the electors shall be published in full with existing charter provisions that would be altered or abrogated by the proposed charter amendment or other question. The purpose of the proposed charter amendment or question shall be designated on the ballot in not more than 100 words, exclusive of caption, that shall consist of a true and impartial statement of the purpose of the amendment or question in language that does not create prejudice for or against the amendment or question. The text of the statement shall be submitted to the attorney general for approval as to compliance with this requirement before being printed. In addition, the proposed charter amendment in full shall be posted in a conspicuous place in each polling place. The form in which a proposed charter amendment or question shall appear on the ballot, unless provided for in the initiatory petition, shall be determined by resolution of the legislative body, and if provided for by the initiatory petition, the legislative body may add an explanatory caption.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   A proposed charter amendment shall be confined to 1 subject. If the subject of a charter amendment includes more than 1 related proposition, each proposition shall be separately stated to afford an opportunity for an elector to vote for or against each proposition. If a proposed charter amendment is rejected at an election, the amendment shall not be resubmitted for a period of 2 years. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   A city charter formerly granted by a different act of the state legislature, including the charter of a city of the fourth class, that adopts or comes under any part of this act by amendment under this section, and not by general revision, adoption, or incorporation under this act, may again be amended under this section, as to the part or parts that are amended, by re-enacting under this section that part or parts of the original act of incorporation that existed before any amendment was made under this act. The part or parts of the original act of incorporation that are re-enacted shall not be construed as operating or coming under the provisions of this act in any manner, it being the intention to permit a city described in this subsection, to adopt by amendment any part of the provisions of this act permissible or to withdraw from the provisions of this act.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Propositions and questions shall be proposed, initiated, submitted and canvassed in a manner similar to that provided for charter amendments.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 25.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   An initiatory petition authorized by this act shall be addressed to and filed with the city clerk. The petition shall state what body, organization, or person is primarily interested in and responsible for the circulation of the petition and the securing of the amendment. Each sheet of the petition shall be verified by the affidavit of the person who obtained the signatures to the petition. The petition shall be signed by at least 5% of the qualified and registered electors of the municipality. Each signer of the petition shall also write, immediately after his or her signature, the date of signing and his or her street address. A signature obtained more than 1 year before the filing of the petition with the city clerk shall not be counted. The petition is subject to the requirements of section 25a.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   A person who willfully affixes another's signature, or subscribes and swears to a verification that is false in any material particular, is guilty of perjury. A person who takes the oath of another to the petition not knowing him or her to be the same person he or she represents himself or herself to be or knowing that the petition or any part of it is false or fraudulent in any material particular, or who falsely represents that the proposed amendment is proposed by persons other than the true sponsors, is guilty of a felony and is liable for the same punishment as provided for perjury.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   Upon receipt of the petition, the city clerk shall canvass it to ascertain if it is signed by the requisite number of registered electors. For the purpose of determining the validity of the petition, the city clerk may check any doubtful signatures against the registration records of the city. Within 45 days from the date of the filing of the petition, the city clerk shall certify the sufficiency or insufficiency of the petition. If the petition contains the requisite number of signatures of registered electors, the clerk shall submit the proposed amendment to the electors of the city at the next regular municipal or general state election held in the city which shall occur not less than 90 days following the filing of the petition.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   If the petition contains the signatures of 20% or more of the persons residing in and registered to vote in the city as of the date when they signed it, and the petition requests submission of the proposal at a special election, the city clerk, within 90 days after the date of the filing of the petition, shall call a special election to be held on the next regular election date that is not less than 120 days after the petition was filed. Other proposals, whether initiated by a 5% petition or proposed by the legislative body within the times within this act provided, may be submitted at that election. A proposal submitted to the electors by the initiative and receiving an affirmative majority of the votes cast on the proposal shall not be held unconstitutional, invalid, or void on account of the insufficiency of the petition by which the proposal was submitted.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   Except as provided by subsection (6), any proposal adopted by the electors that contemplates increased expenditure of funds by the municipality shall become effective only at the beginning of that fiscal year of the municipality commencing not earlier than 60 days following the election at which the proposal was approved by the electors.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   If a proposal that increases the city's ad valorem property tax limitation applies, by its terms, for a specific year or period commencing before the date the proposal would otherwise take effect under subsection (5), the proposal shall be effective both from the date it is approved by the electors and retroactively for the year or period specified in the proposal. Notwithstanding a charter provision to the contrary, if a proposal is approved by the electors and given effect under this subsection after the city has levied its ad valorem property tax levy for the fiscal year and if the adopted proposal authorizes the levy of a millage rate for the fiscal year during which the proposal was approved in excess of the rate the city was authorized to levy before adoption of the proposal, the city may levy an additional tax. The additional tax shall be collected either by a supplementary billing by the city or at the same time and in the same manner the county's ad valorem property tax levy is collected.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)   A person aggrieved by an action, or failure of action, of the city clerk may bring an action against the clerk in the circuit court for writ of mandamus or for other appropriate relief.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   "Ward" means a district comprising less than all of the area of a city which constitutes the political unit from which 1 or more members of the local legislative body is nominated, elected or nominated and elected.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   The population of each city subject to the provisions of this section shall, in the first instance, be determined from the most recent official United States decennial census. Other governmental census figures of total city population may be used if taken subsequent to the latest decennial United States census and the last decennial United States census figures are inadequate for the purposes of this section. Each city shall have the power to conduct its own census for this purpose.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   This section shall be applicable to all cities that do not elect all the members of their local legislative body at large. This section shall not repeal any charter provisions meeting the standards established herein but shall be applicable to all charters that fail in whole or in part, to meet the standards herein, or the constitutional requirements of this state or United States constitution. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   In each such city subject to the provisions of this section the local legislative body, not later than December 1, 1967, shall apportion the wards of the city in accord with this section. In subsequent years, the local legislative body, prior to the next general municipal election occurring not earlier than 4 months following the date of the official release of the census figures of each United States decennial census, shall apportion the wards of the city in accord with this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)   The local legislative body shall file the apportionment plan with the city clerk and make copies available at cost to any registered voter of the city. Such plan shall provide for wards which are as nearly of equal population as is practicable and contiguous and compact. Residents of state institutions who cannot by law register in the city as electors shall be excluded from population computations where the number of such persons is identifiable in the census figures available. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)   Any registered voter of the city within 30 days after the filing of the apportionment plan for his city, or within 30 days after such apportionment plan shall be submitted, may petition the circuit court to determine if the plan meets the requirements of the laws and constitution of this state and the United States.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Except as otherwise provided under this section, if a financial emergency exists under the local financial stability and choice act, 2012 PA 436, MCL 141.1541 to 141.1575, a city may issue financial recovery bonds in amounts greater than the limitations established by the city charter or this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) Any financial recovery bonds issued under this section are subject to the terms and conditions approved by the local emergency financial assistance loan board created under the emergency municipal loan act, 1980 PA 243, MCL 141.931 to 141.942.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Any financial recovery bonds issued under this section are not subject to section 5(g).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the net indebtedness of a city, reduced by any amounts excluded under section 4a(4), shall not exceed 20% of the assessed value of the city.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) Notwithstanding subsection (4), the net indebtedness of a city that issues financial recovery bonds under subsection (6), reduced by any amounts excluded under section 4a(4), shall not exceed 12% of the assessed value of the city, adjusted for additions as provided under section 4a(9).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) If financial recovery bonds are issued under this subsection by a city with a population of less than 10,000 that is located in a county organized under 1966 PA 293, MCL 45.501 to 45.521, the city may provide in the order authorizing the issuance of the bonds for the deposit of revenues generated from taxes levied by the city, including a tax levied by the city to pay a judgment or comply with a court order, into an escrow account to be used for the purpose of paying principal of and interest on the bonds and the administrative costs associated with issuing the bonds, and the tax revenues may be pledged by the city for the payment of the bonds issued under this section. Bonds issued under this subsection shall be limited in amount to that necessary to pay court-ordered judgments against the city existing on May 25, 2011 and administrative costs associated with issuing the bonds. If the city enters into an agreement with a third-party tax collector pursuant to which the third-party tax collector has the duty to collect taxes that otherwise would be collected by the city treasurer, the agreement shall also provide for the direct payment of all tax revenues pledged for payment of bonds issued pursuant to this section collected by the third-party tax collector to a trustee to be deposited into an escrow account and used for the sole purpose of paying principal of and interest on the bonds. If the city and a third-party tax collector enter into an agreement providing for the direct payment of taxes to a trustee, a statutory lien and trust is created applicable to those tax revenues received or to be received from the third-party tax collector by the trustee. The tax revenues paid or to be paid to a trustee for the purpose of paying the principal of and interest on the bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be subject to a lien and trust, which is a statutory lien and trust paramount and superior to all other liens and interests of any kind, for the sole purpose of paying the principal of and interest on bonds issued pursuant to this section and any other bonds subsequently issued by the city sharing a parity or subordinate pledge of those tax revenues. The lien and trust created under this subsection for the benefit of bondholders or others is perfected without delivery, recording, or notice. The tax revenues held or to be held by a trustee shall be held in trust for the sole benefit of the holders of the bonds issued pursuant to this section and are exempt from being levied upon, taken, sequestered, or applied toward paying the debts or liabilities of the city other than for payment of debt service on the bonds to which the lien applies. As used in this subsection, "third-party tax collector" means a party that is not the city treasurer or other elected or appointed city official with whom the city has entered into a contractual agreement pursuant to which the third-party tax collector agrees to collect taxes that otherwise would be collected by the city treasurer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) A city that issues financial recovery bonds under this section subsequently may refund all or a portion of those bonds subject to the terms and conditions approved by the local emergency financial assistance loan board. However, the local emergency financial assistance loan board shall not approve any term or condition under this subsection that materially alters any existing term, condition, lien, or priority that applied to the bonds before the refunding if the approval would constitute an impermissible contract impairment. If financial recovery bonds are or have been issued by a city under this section, the city may provide additional security for the prior bonds pursuant to this subsection and may issue financial recovery bonds pursuant to this subsection to be sold to the Michigan finance authority for the purpose of refunding all or a portion of the prior bonds, or other obligations of the city, and for such other purposes as approved by the local emergency financial assistance loan board. A city may by resolution or order provide for the deposit of revenues pledged for the payment of prior bonds or bonds issued pursuant to this subsection into a separate account for the purpose of paying principal and interest on those obligations, the administrative costs associated with those obligations, and any other obligations issued by the city that are secured by those revenues. For purposes of this subsection, principal and interest may include termination fees and credit enhancement fees, if any. If the city enters into an agreement with a third party that has a duty or obligation under the agreement or under state law to collect for, pay, remit, disburse, or distribute to the city all or a portion of the revenues pledged by the city for the payment of principal and interest on prior bonds or bonds issued pursuant to this subsection, the agreement shall also provide for the direct payment of the revenues that the third party has a duty or obligation to collect for, pay, remit, disburse, or distribute to the city, and that the city has pledged for payment of the prior bonds or bonds issued pursuant to this subsection, to a trustee to be deposited into a trust account and used for the sole purpose of paying principal of and interest on the prior bonds or bonds issued pursuant to this subsection and related administrative costs and any other obligations issued by the city that are secured by those revenues. The agreement shall be authorized by resolution or order of the city and approved by the local emergency financial assistance loan board. If the city and a third party enter into an agreement providing for the direct payment of the revenues pledged by the city for the payment of prior bonds or bonds issued pursuant to this subsection to a trustee, a statutory lien and trust is created applicable to those revenues received from the third party by the trustee, and the revenues paid to a trustee for the purpose of paying the principal and interest on prior bonds or bonds issued pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to a lien and trust that is a statutory lien and trust paramount and superior to all other liens and interests of any kind, for the sole purpose of paying the principal and interest on the prior bonds of the city or bonds of the city issued pursuant to this subsection and related administrative costs and any other obligations issued by the city that are secured by those revenues. The lien and trust created under this subsection is perfected without delivery, recording, or notice. The revenues held by a trustee pursuant to an agreement shall be held in trust pursuant to this subsection and are exempt from being levied upon, taken, sequestered, or applied toward paying the debts or liabilities of the city other than for payment of debt service on the obligations and related administrative costs to which the lien applies. A statutory lien and trust created by this subsection applicable to distributable aid received from the state treasurer by a paying agent, escrow agent, or trustee, shall apply only to the distributable aid, as that term is defined in section 9 of the fiscal stabilization act, 1981 PA 80, MCL 141.1009, after it has been appropriated and shall be subject to any subsequent reduction of that appropriation by operation of law or executive order. Nothing in this subsection shall abridge or reduce the ability of the state treasurer to withhold distributable aid from a city as provided by the Glenn Steil state revenue sharing act of 1971, 1971 PA 140, MCL 141.901 to 141.921. Financial recovery bonds issued pursuant to this subsection are not subject to subsection (4). This subsection shall not be construed to do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Create or constitute state indebtedness.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Require the state to continue to impose and collect taxes from which distributable aid is paid or to make payments of distributable aid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Limit or prohibit the state from repealing or amending a law enacted for the distributable aid, or for the manner, time, or amount of distributable aid.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a city with a population of more than 600,000 that is located in a county organized under 1966 PA 293, MCL 45.501 to 45.521, issues or has issued financial recovery bonds pursuant to subsection (7), and the city, as a specified condition of the issuance, has entered into an agreement with a trustee for the deposit of revenues pledged by the city into a trust account as provided in subsection (7) that is established for the sole purpose of paying principal of and interest on those bonds and related administrative expenses, and the city has received the approval of the state treasurer, then, at all times after the issuance of the bonds and before the deposit of the revenues of the city into that trust account, the revenues of the city to be deposited are held in trust for the benefit of the trustee and the bonds by any party that comes into possession of the revenues. The revenues are held in trust for the benefit of the trustee and the bonds regardless of whether the city directly collects the revenues, a third party collects the revenues on the city's behalf, or any other person comes into possession of the revenues, and the revenues remain subject to the trust regardless of subsequent transfer or transfers of the revenues until such time as the revenues are deposited into that trust account. To the extent that the city or any other person holds a residual or other interest in the revenues held in trust and to be deposited with the trustee in the trust account, the interest is subordinate to a lien in the revenues in favor of the trustee for the purpose of ensuring delivery of the revenues to the trust account. This lien arises by operation of law and without further act or notice of any kind at the earliest time that the city has or acquires any rights in the revenues pledged pursuant to the agreement, is and will remain paramount and superior to all other liens and interests of any kind, and is perfected without delivery, recording, or notice. The revenues held in trust and to be deposited into the trust account pursuant to this subsection are exempt from being levied upon, taken, sequestered, or applied toward paying the debts or liabilities of the city other than those expressly specified in the agreement described in this subsection and subsection (7). </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) Financial recovery bonds issued under this section are not subject to the revised municipal finance act, 2001 PA 34, MCL 141.2101 to 141.2821.</div>
