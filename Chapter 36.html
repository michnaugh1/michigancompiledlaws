The department of treasury shall provide technical expertise as necessary for the authority to issue bonds under this act.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) The board of the authority shall authorize the issuance of bonds by resolution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the authority may issue bonds, including refunding bonds, without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau, or agency of this state and without any other proceedings or the occurrence of any other conditions other than those proceedings, conditions, or things that are specifically required by this act. Every issue of bonds shall be special revenue obligations payable from and secured by a pledge of revenues and other assets, including without limitation the proceeds of the bonds deposited in a reserve fund for the benefit of the owners of the bonds, earnings on funds of the authority and other funds as may become available, upon the terms and conditions as specified by the authority in the authority resolution under which the bonds are issued or in a related trust agreement or trust indenture. The authority shall provide notice to the speaker of the house and majority leader of the senate of their intent to issue bonds under this section. The notice shall include estimated principal amount or amounts and authorized purpose of issuing the bond or bonds. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(i) Any other terms and conditions necessary to issue the bonds in fully marketable form.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) The authority may sell the bonds in the manner determined by the authority board, at public or private sale, and on either a competitive or negotiated basis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) This act shall govern the creation, perfection, priority, and enforcement of any pledge of revenues or other security made by the authority.

A trust agreement or trust indenture authorized under this subsection or an authority resolution may contain provisions respecting the custody, safeguarding, and application of all money and bonds and may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies under the sale agreement of the owners of the bonds and benefited parties as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state that may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of any other funds or obligations received on behalf of the authority to furnish indemnifying bonds or to pledge obligations as may be required by the authority.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) A member, officer, employee or agent of the authority shall not have an interest, either directly or indirectly, in any business organization engaged in any business, contract or transaction with the authority or in any contract of any other person engaged in any business with the authority, or in the purchase, sale, lease or transfer of any property to or from the authority.</div>
