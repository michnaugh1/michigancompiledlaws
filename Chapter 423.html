<P>Sec. 9a.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   If it becomes apparent to the commission that there is no reasonable probability of settlement of a labor dispute by mediation and that further efforts to that end would be without avail, there shall be held in the case of an impending strike, an election upon such issue which election shall be conducted and supervised by the commission, or by its duly authorized representative. If either party to the dispute notifies the commission in writing, a copy of which shall at the same time be served on the other party, that, in the opinion of such party, further efforts to settle the dispute by mediation would be without avail, the commission may cause an election to be held within 10 days after the receipt of the notice unless it is not practicable to hold the election within that period, in which event the election shall be held within 20 days after receipt of the notice. Every employee in the bargaining unit, which is involved in the dispute, as that bargaining unit is determined under section 9e or as recognized by the employer or as identified by contract or past practice, shall be entitled to vote in the election. The election shall be by secret ballot, and shall be held on the premises where those voting are employed unless the commission shall determine that the election cannot be fairly held there, in which case it shall be held at such place as the commission shall determine. The commission may promulgate rules as necessary to effectively conduct any election, including provisions for absentee voting. The provisions shall facilitate voting by all employees, and shall insure secrecy of the ballot. The commission may determine after proper hearing any disputed issue concerning the eligibility of a person or persons to vote in the election. The hearing may be held either before or after an election and may be conducted by an authorized representative of the commission. A determination with respect to eligibility shall be applicable in the administration of this section, but shall not have force and effect for any other purpose under this act.</DIV>

</P>
<P>Sec. 9d.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Any labor dispute, other than a representation question, may lawfully be submitted to voluntary arbitration in the manner provided in this section. However, arbitration of labor disputes without complying with this section shall be valid as it has heretofore been under the common law.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   (a) When a labor dispute involves the meaning or interpretation of an existing collective agreement between an employer and a labor organization and the collective agreement provides for the use of a designated arbitrator to decide disputes thereunder, or provides the method for selection of arbitrator or arbitrators, the provisions of that agreement shall be binding upon the parties, and shall be complied with unless the parties agree to submit the dispute to some other arbitration procedure.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   Disputes, other than representation questions, for which a settlement procedure by arbitration is not provided under any collective agreement between the employer and the labor organization involved, may be submitted to arbitration by agreement of the parties. The agreement to arbitrate shall be in writing, shall provide that the arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to this section, and shall include an undertaking by each of the parties that he will faithfully abide by and perform the arbitration award. The agreement, or a supplemental agreement, shall also specify the issue or issues to be decided, shall make provision for the payment by the parties, or either of them, of the costs and expenses of the arbitration, and may include such other provisions, not inconsistent herewith, as shall be agreeable to the parties. However, the commission may, upon the request of the parties, and upon finding that the parties, or either of them, are unable to bear the expense of the arbitration, designate an arbitrator for a dispute, in which event the expense of the arbitration, including a per diem fee of $50.00 and necessary expenses of the arbitrator, shall be paid out of the general fund. An agreement to arbitrate an existing or future dispute shall be enforceable in equity by any circuit court having jurisdiction.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)   The arbitrator or arbitrators designated in a proceeding shall within 20 days after his or their appointment, proceed to conduct hearings in the dispute. Reasonable notice of the hearings shall be given to the parties, who may appear and be heard both in person and by counsel or other representative. Hearings shall be informal, and the rules of evidence prevailing in judicial proceedings shall not be binding. Oral or documentary evidence and other data deemed relevant by the arbitrator or arbitrators may be received in evidence. A transcript of the proceedings shall be taken if the arbitrator or arbitrators so desire, or at the request and at the expense of any party. Within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing, or within such additional period as the parties shall stipulate, the arbitrator or arbitrators shall make written findings and promulgate a written opinion and award upon the issue or issues presented and shall mail or otherwise deliver a true copy thereof to each of the parties. A majority vote of the arbitrators, if there be more than 1, shall constitute a decision on any matter. This section shall not supersede or invalidate the provisions of any collective agreement under which the parties are required to arbitrate disputes under subsection (2)(a).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)   An award rendered in a proceeding hereunder shall be enforceable at law or in equity as the agreement of the parties.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)   Rulings or orders promulgated by the commission shall be reviewable only by the supreme court and on petition for writ of certiorari or such other process as may be appropriate, except as provided in this section.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)   Violations of the provisions of sections 16, 17a, and 22(a) of this act only, shall be deemed to be unfair labor practices remediable by the commission in the following manner:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   When it is charged that any person has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, the commission, or any agent designated by the commission for such purposes, may issue and cause to be served upon the person a complaint stating the charges in that respect, and containing a notice of hearing before the commission or a commissioner, or before a designated agent, at a place therein fixed, not less than 5 days after the serving of the complaint. No complaint shall issue based upon any unfair labor practice occurring more than 6 months prior to the filing of the charge with the commission and the service of a copy thereof upon the person against whom the charge is made, unless the person aggrieved thereby was prevented from filing the charge by reason of service in the armed forces, in which event the 6-month period shall be computed from the day of his discharge. Any complaint may be amended by the commissioner or agent conducting the hearing or the commission, at any time prior to the issuance of an order based thereon. The person upon whom the complaint is served may file an answer to the original or amended complaint and appear in person or otherwise and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint. In the discretion of the commissioner or agent conducting the hearing or the commission, any other person may be allowed to intervene in the proceeding and to present testimony. Any proceeding shall be conducted pursuant to chapter 4 of Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, as amended, being sections 24.271 to 24.287 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The testimony taken by the commissioner, agent or the commission shall be reduced to writing and filed with the commission. Thereafter the commission upon notice may take further testimony or hear argument. If upon the preponderance of the testimony taken the commission is of the opinion that any person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in the unfair labor practice, then it shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such person an order requiring that person to cease and desist from the unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this act. The order may further require the person to make reports from time to time showing the extent to which that person has complied with the order. If, upon the preponderance of the testimony taken the commission is not of the opinion that the person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in the unfair labor practice, then the commission shall state its findings of fact and shall issue an order dismissing the complaint. No order of the commission shall require the reinstatement of any individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged, or the payment to him of any back pay, if the individual was suspended or discharged for cause. If the evidence is presented before a commissioner, or before examiners thereof, the commissioner, or examiners shall issue and cause to be served on the parties to the proceeding a proposed report, together with a recommended order, which shall be filed with the commission, and if exceptions are not filed within 20 days after service thereof upon the parties, or within such further period as the commission may authorize, the recommended order shall become the order of the commission and become effective as prescribed in the order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Until the record in a case has been filed in a court, the commission at any time, upon reasonable notice and in such manner as it deems proper, may modify or set aside, in whole or in part, any finding or order made or issued by it.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The commission or any prevailing party may petition the court of appeals for the enforcement of the order and for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order, and shall file in the court the record in the proceedings. Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the person, and thereupon shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and shall summarily grant such temporary or permanent relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, enforcing, modifying, enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the commission. No objection that has not been urged before the commission, its commissioner or agent, shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge the objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances. The findings of the commission with respect to questions of fact if supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive. If either party applies to the court for leave to present additional evidence and shows to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to present it in the hearing before the commission, its commissioner or agent, the court may order the additional evidence to be taken before the commission, its commissioner or agent, and to be made a part of the record. The commission may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of additional evidence so taken and filed, and it shall file the modifying or new findings, which findings with respect to questions of fact if supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive, and shall file its recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original order. Upon the filing of the record with it the jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment and decree shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the supreme court in accordance with the general court rules.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Any party aggrieved by a final order of the commission granting or denying in whole or in part the relief sought may within 20 days of such order as a matter of right obtain a review of the order in the court of appeals by filing in the court a petition praying that the order of the commission be modified or set aside, with copy of the petition filed on the commission, and thereupon the aggrieved party shall file in the court the record in the proceeding, certified by the commission. Upon the timely filing of the petition, the court shall proceed in the same manner as in the case of an application by the commission under subsection (d), and shall summarily grant to the commission or to any prevailing party such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, enforcing, modifying, enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the commission. The findings of the commission with respect to questions of fact if supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive. If a timely petition for review is not filed under this subdivision by an aggrieved party, it shall be conclusively presumed that the commission's order is supported by competent, material and substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, and the commission or any prevailing party shall be entitled, upon application therefor, to a summary order enforcing the commission's order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The commencement of proceedings under subdivision (d) or (e), shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the commission's order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Petitions filed under subdivisions (d) and (e) shall be heard expeditiously by the courts to which presented, and for good cause shown shall take precedence over all other civil matters except earlier matters of the same character.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   The commission and/or any charging party shall have power, upon issuance of complaint as provided in subdivision (a) charging that any person has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, shall have power to petition any circuit court within any circuit where the unfair labor practice in question is alleged to have occurred or where the person resides or transacts business, for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order, in accordance with the general court rules, and the court shall have jurisdiction to grant to the commission and/or any charging party such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   For the purpose of all hearings and investigations, which, in the opinion of the commission, are necessary and proper for the exercise of the powers vested in it under this section, the provisions of section 11 shall be applicable, except that subpoenas may issue as provided in section 11 without regard to whether mediation shall have been undertaken.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)   The labor relations and mediation functions of this act shall be separately administered by the commission.</DIV>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) Upon belief that conditions constituting a strike by 1 or more public employees in violation of section 2 exist, the public school employer or the superintendent of public instruction, after consultation with the public school employer, shall notify the commission of the full or partial days that the alleged strike has occurred and the name and address of the bargaining representative. The notice shall be accompanied by a sworn affidavit, supported by any available documentary proof, containing a clear and concise statement of the facts upon which the public school employer or the superintendent of public instruction relies to establish a violation of section 2. The public school employer or the superintendent of public instruction shall concurrently serve the bargaining representative with a copy of the notice. If the public school employer or the superintendent of public instruction has not notified the commission of an allegation of a strike under this subsection, a parent or legal guardian of a child who is enrolled in the school district may notify the commission of the full or partial days that 1 or more public school employees were engaged in an alleged strike.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) If a bargaining representative alleges that there is a lockout by a public school employer in violation of section 2, the bargaining representative shall notify the commission of the full or partial days of the alleged lockout.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) Within 15 days after receipt of a notice under subsection (1) or (2), the commission shall conduct a hearing to determine if conditions constituting a strike by 1 or more public school employees in violation of section 2 or a lockout exist. The person giving notice under subsection (1) or (2) bears the burden of proof at the hearing on the allegations. The commission shall issue its decision within 3 business days after the close of the hearing. A hearing conducted under this subsection is separate and distinct from, and is not subject to the procedures and timelines of, a proceeding conducted under section 6.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) If the commission determines that conditions constituting a strike in violation of section 2 exist, the superintendent of public instruction or the public school employer shall, within 5 business days after notification of the decision, notify the commission of the name and home address of each public school employee alleged to have participated in the strike. The superintendent of public instruction or the public school employer shall, within the same period, serve with or mail to each named public school employee a copy of the notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(5) A public school employee named in the notice under subsection (4) and alleged to have been either absent from work without permission of the public school employer or to have abstained wholly or in part from the full performance of his or her normal duties without permission on a date when a strike occurred is presumed to have engaged in the strike on that date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) A public school employee presumed to have engaged in a strike in violation of section 2 may challenge that presumption within 10 days after the date the notice was served or mailed to the employee under subsection (4), by filing with the commission and causing to be served on the superintendent of public instruction or the public school employer, a sworn affidavit, supported by available documentary proof, containing a clear and concise statement of the facts upon which he or she relies to show that the determination was incorrect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(7) The public school employer shall deduct from the annual salary of a public school employee named in a notice under subsection (4) who fails to file an affidavit and supporting proof under subsection (6) an amount equal to 1 day of pay for that public school employee for each full or partial day that he or she engaged in the strike. The public school employee's annual salary is the annual salary that is established in the applicable contract in effect at the time of the strike or, if no applicable contract is in effect at the time of the strike, in the applicable contract in effect at the time of the deduction. However, if no applicable contract is in effect at either of those times, the public school employee's annual salary shall be considered to be the annual salary that applied or would have applied to the public school employee in the most recent applicable contract in effect before the strike. A public school employer shall comply promptly with this subsection. A deduction under this subsection is not a demotion for purposes of 1937 (Ex Sess) PA 4, MCL 38.71 to 38.191.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(8) If a public school employee named in a notice under subsection (4) files a timely affidavit and supporting proof, a commissioner, the commission, or an agent of the commission shall, within 15 days after receipt of the affidavit and supporting proof, commence a hearing to determine whether the public school employee engaged in a strike in violation of section 2. The public school employee bears the burden of proof at the hearing. A hearing conducted under this subsection is separate and distinct from, and is not subject to the procedures and timelines of, a proceeding under section 6.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(9) After a hearing under subsection (8), if a commissioner, the commission, or an agent of the commission determines by the preponderance of the evidence that the public school employee engaged in a strike in violation of section 2, the individual or commission shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the public school employee an order requiring the employee to cease and desist from the unlawful conduct and the public school employer to deduct from the annual salary, as described in subsection (7), of the public school employee an amount equal to 1 day of pay for that public school employee for each full or partial day that he or she engaged in the strike. If the evidence is presented before a commissioner or agent of the commission, the commissioner or agent shall issue and cause to be served on the parties to the proceeding a proposed decision, together with a recommended order, which shall be filed with the commission. If a party does not file an exception within 20 days after service of the proposed decision, the recommended order becomes the order of the commission and is effective as stated in the order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(10) If, after a hearing under subsection (3), a majority of the commission finds that a public school employer instituted a lockout in violation of section 2, the commission shall fine the public school employer $5,000.00 for each full or partial day of the lockout and shall fine each member of the public school employer's governing board $250.00 for each full or partial day of the lockout. The fine shall be paid to the commission and transmitted as provided in subsection (11).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(11) If a public school employer does not deduct money from a public school employee's pay pursuant to an order under this section or if the commission does not receive payment of a fine it imposed under this section within 30 days, the superintendent of public instruction shall institute collection proceedings and the money received shall be transmitted to the state treasurer for deposit in the state school aid fund established under section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(12) Deductions imposed under this section are in addition to any loss of pay attributable to the full or partial day that the public school employee was absent from work as a result of the strike under section 2 and any other penalty prescribed by this act and by other law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(13) Fines imposed under this section are in addition to all other penalties prescribed by this act and by law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(14) A public school employer, the superintendent of public instruction, or the attorney general may bring an action to enjoin a strike by public school employees in violation of section 2, and a bargaining representative may bring an action to enjoin a lockout by a public school employer in violation of section 2, in the circuit court for the county in which the affected public school is located. If the commission has made a determination after a hearing under subsection (3) that a strike or lockout exists, that finding shall not be overturned except by clear and convincing evidence. If the court having jurisdiction of an action brought under this subsection finds that conditions constituting a strike or lockout in violation of section 2 exist and unless clear and convincing evidence has shown that the sanction would not be equitable or the sanction would duplicate a sanction imposed by the commission for the same activity under subsection (9) or (10), the court shall do all of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) For a strike in violation of section 2, order each public school employee to pay a fine in an amount equal to 1 day of pay for that public school employee for each full or partial day the public school employee engaged in the strike.

A fine imposed under this subsection shall be transmitted to the state treasurer for deposit into the state school aid fund established under section 11 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Order the public school employees or public school employer acting in violation of section 2 to end the strike or lockout.</div>

Sept. 19, 2016 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> That portion of MCL 423.202a(4) imposing automatic mandatory fines on bargaining representatives for strikes by their membership was struck down by the Wayne County Circuit Court in Michigan State AFL-CIO, et al v Michigan Employment Relations Commission (Docket Nos. 94-420652-CL &amp; 94-423581-CL) on March 2, 1995. The Court found that this proviso violated due process under U.S. Const. Am XIV or Const. 1963, art 1, § 17. The Court also struck down that portion of MCL 423.202a(10) which required circuit courts, upon application by a party, to issue injunctions against strikes or lockouts without considering traditional equity factors. The Court concluded that this provision violated the separation of powers under Const 1963, art 3, § 2. No appeal was taken from these findings. Michigan State AFL-CIO v. MERC, 212 Mich.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(1) A public employer or an officer or agent of a public employer shall not do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Interfere with, restrain, or coerce public employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed in section 9. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Initiate, create, dominate, contribute to, or interfere with the formation or administration of a labor organization. A public employer may allow employees to confer with a labor organization during working hours without loss of time or pay. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Discriminate in regard to hiring, terms, or other conditions of employment to encourage or discourage membership in a labor organization. However, this act or any other law of this state does not preclude a public employer from making an agreement with an exclusive bargaining representative as described in section 11 to require as a condition of employment that all other employees in the bargaining unit pay to the exclusive bargaining representative a service fee equivalent to the amount of dues uniformly required of members of the exclusive bargaining representative.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Discriminate against a public employee because the public employee has given testimony or instituted proceedings under this act. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(e) Refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of its public employees, subject to section 11. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(2) It is the purpose of 1973 PA 25 to reaffirm the continuing public policy of this state that the stability and effectiveness of labor relations in the public sector require, if the requirement is negotiated with the public employer, that all other employees in the bargaining unit share fairly in the financial support of their exclusive bargaining representative by paying to the exclusive bargaining representative a service fee that may be equivalent to the amount of dues uniformly required of members of the exclusive bargaining representative.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(3) A labor organization or its agents shall not do any of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) Restrain or coerce public employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 9. This subdivision does not impair the right of a labor organization to prescribe its own rules with respect to the acquisition or retention of membership. </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) Restrain or coerce a public employer in the selection of its representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances. </div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(d) Refuse to bargain collectively with a public employer, if it is the representative of the public employer's employees, subject to section 11.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(4) By July 1 of each year, each exclusive bargaining representative that represents public employees in this state shall have an independent examiner verify the exclusive bargaining representative's calculation of all expenditures attributed to the costs of collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment during the prior calendar year and shall file that verification with the commission. The commission shall make the exclusive bargaining representative's calculations available to the public on the commission's website. The exclusive bargaining representative shall also file a declaration identifying the local bargaining units that are represented. Local bargaining units identified in the declaration filed by the exclusive bargaining representative are not required to file a separate calculation of all expenditures attributed to the costs of collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. </div>

This act does not, and a law or policy of a local government must not, prohibit or limit an agreement that requires public employees in the bargaining unit, as a condition of continued employment, to pay to the bargaining representative membership dues or service fees. This subsection becomes effective immediately upon, and applies to the extent permitted by, either of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(a) A decision or ruling by the United States Supreme Court that reverses or limits, in whole or in part, Janus v AFSCME, Council 31, ___US___; 138 S Ct 2448 (2018).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(b) The ratification of an amendment to the United States Constitution that restores the ability to require, as a condition of employment, a public employee who is not a member of a bargaining representative to pay, under any circumstances, fees, including agency fees, to the bargaining representative.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(6) For fiscal year 2022-2023, $1,000,000.00 is appropriated to the department of labor and economic opportunity to be expended to do all of the following regarding the 2023 amendatory act that added this sentence:</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>(c) Inform public employers, public employees, and bargaining representatives about changes to their rights and responsibilities under the amendatory act.</div>

Am. 2023, Act 114, Eff. Feb. 13, 2024 <BR><B>Constitutionality:</B> In Lehnert v Ferris Faculty Association, 500 US 507; 111 S Ct 1950; 114 L Ed 2d 572 (1991), the United States Supreme Court held that a collective-bargaining unit constitutionally may compel its employees to subsidize only certain union activities. “[I]n determining which activities a union constitutionally may charge to dissenting employees ... chargeable activities must (1) be 'germane' to collective-bargaining activity; (2) be justified by the government's vital policy interest in labor peace and avoiding 'free riders'; and (3) not significantly add to the burdening of free speech that is inherent in the allowance of an agency or union shop.”Ruling on the respondent union's disputed activities, the Court held:(1) The respondent may not charge the funds of objecting employees for a program designed to secure funds for Michigan public education or for that portion of a union publication that reports on those activities. The Court found none of the activities “to be oriented toward the ratification or implementation of petitioner's collective-bargaining agreement.”(2) The respondent may bill dissenting employees for their share of general collective-bargaining costs of the state or national parent union. The district court had found these costs to be germane to collective bargaining and similar support services; the court agreed with the finding.(3) The respondent may not charge for the expenses of litigation that does not concern the dissenting employees' bargaining unit or, by extension, union literature reporting on such activities. The Court found extra-unit litigation to be proscribed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution because it is “more akin to lobbying in both kind and effect” and not germane to a union's activities as an exclusive bargaining agent.(4) The respondent may not bill for certain public relations activities. The Court states: “[T]he ... activities ... entailed speech of a political nature in a public forum. More important, public speech in support of the teaching profession generally is not sufficiently related to the union's collective-bargaining functions to justify compelling dissenting employees to support it. Expression of this kind extends beyond the negotiation and grievance-resolution contexts and imposes a substantially greater burden upon First Amendment rights ... .”(5) The respondent may charge for those portions of a union publication that concern teaching and education generally, professional development, unemployment, job opportunities, union award programs, and miscellaneous matters. The Court noted that such informational support services are neither political nor public in nature and that expenditures for them benefit all, without additional infringements upon the First Amendment.(6) The respondent may bill for fees to send delegates to state and national affiliated conventions. The Court found that participation by local members in the formal activities of the parent is an important benefit of affiliation and an essential part of a union's discharge of its duties as a bargaining agent.(7) The respondent may charge expenses incidental to preparation for a strike which, had it occurred, would have been illegal under Michigan law. The Court, noting that the Michigan Legislature had imposed no restriction, stated there was no First Amendment limitation on such charges. The Court added that such expenses are “substantively indistinguishable from those appurtenant to collective-bargaining negotiations ... enure to the direct benefit of members of the dissenters' unit ... and impose no additional burden upon First Amendment rights.”<BR><B>Compiler's Notes:</B> Enacting section 1 of Act 349 of 2012 provides:"Enacting section 1.

</P>
<P>Sec. 16.</P>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Violations of the provisions of section 10 shall be deemed to be unfair labor practices remediable by the commission in the following manner:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)   Whenever it is charged that any person has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, the commission, or any agent designated by the commission for such purposes, may issue and cause to be served upon the person a complaint stating the charges in that respect, and containing a notice of hearing before the commission or a commissioner thereof, or before a designated agent, at a place therein fixed, not less than 5 days after the serving of the complaint. No complaint shall issue based upon any unfair labor practice occurring more than 6 months prior to the filing of the charge with the commission and the service of a copy thereof upon the person against whom the charge is made, unless the person aggrieved thereby was prevented from filing the charge by reason of service in the armed forces, in which event the 6-month period shall be computed from the day of his discharge. Any complaint may be amended by the commissioner or agent conducting the hearing or the commission, at any time prior to the issuance of an order based thereon. The person upon whom the complaint is served may file an answer to the original or amended complaint and appear in person or otherwise and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint. In the discretion of the commissioner or agent conducting the hearing or the commission, any other person may be allowed to intervene in the proceeding and to present testimony. Any proceeding shall be conducted pursuant to chapter 4 of Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of 1969, as amended, being sections 24.271 to 24.287 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)   The testimony taken by the commissioner, agent, or the commission shall be reduced to writing and filed with the commission. Thereafter the commission upon notice may take further testimony or hear argument. If upon the preponderance of the testimony taken the commission is of the opinion that any person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in the unfair labor practice, then it shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the person an order requiring him to cease and desist from the unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this act. The order may further require the person to make reports from time to time showing the extent to which he has complied with the order. If upon the preponderance of the testimony taken the commission is not of the opinion that the person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in the unfair labor practice, then the commission shall state its findings of fact and shall issue an order dismissing the complaint. No order of the commission shall require the reinstatement of any individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged, or the payment to him of any back pay, if the individual was suspended or discharged for cause. If the evidence is presented before a commissioner of the commission, or before examiners thereof, the commissioner, or examiners shall issue and cause to be served on the parties to the proceeding a proposed report, together with a recommended order, which shall be filed with the commission, and if an exception is not filed within 20 days after service thereof upon the parties, or within such further period as the commission may authorize, the recommended order shall become the order of the commission and become effective as prescribed in the order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)   Until the record in a case has been filed in a court, the commission at any time, upon reasonable notice and in such manner as it deems proper, may modify or set aside, in whole or in part, any finding or order made or issued by it.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)   The commission or any prevailing party may petition the court of appeals for the enforcement of the order and for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order, and shall file in the court the record in the proceedings. Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the person, and thereupon shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and shall summarily grant such temporary or permanent relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, enforcing, modifying, enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the commission. No objection that has not been urged before the commission, its commissioner or agent, shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge the objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances. The findings of the commission with respect to questions of fact if supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive. If either party applies to the court for leave to present additional evidence and shows to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to present it in the hearing before the commission, its commissioner or agent, the court may order the additional evidence to be taken before the commission, its commissioner or agent, and to be made a part of the record. The commission may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of additional evidence so taken and filed, and it shall file the modifying or new findings, which findings with respect to questions of fact if supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive, and shall file its recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original order. Upon the filing of the record with it the jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment and decree shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the supreme court in accordance with the general court rules.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)   Any party aggrieved by a final order of the commission granting or denying in whole or in part the relief sought may within 20 days of such order as a matter of right obtain a review of the order in the court of appeals by filing in the court a petition praying that the order of the commission be modified or set aside, with copy of the petition filed on the commission, and thereupon the aggrieved party shall file in the court the record in the proceeding, certified by the commission. Upon the timely filing of the petition, the court shall proceed in the same manner as in the case of an application by the commission under subsection (d), and shall summarily grant to the commission or to any prevailing party such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, enforcing, modifying, enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the commission. The findings of the commission with respect to questions of fact if supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive. If a timely petition for review is not filed under this subdivision by an aggrieved party, it shall be conclusively presumed that the commission's order is supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, and the commission or any prevailing party shall be entitled, upon application therefor, to a summary order enforcing the commission's order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)   The commencement of proceedings under subdivisions (d) or (e) shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the commission's order.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)   Petitions filed under subdivisions (d) and (e) shall be heard expeditiously by the court to which presented, and for good cause shown shall take precedence over all other civil matters except earlier matters of the same character.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)   The commission or any charging party shall have power, upon issuance of a complaint as provided in subdivision (a) charging that any person has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, to petition any circuit court within any circuit where the unfair labor practice in question is alleged to have occurred or where such person resides or exercises or may exercise its governmental authority, for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order, in accordance with the general court rules, and the court shall have jurisdiction to grant to the commission or any charging party such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)   For the purpose of all hearings and investigations, which in the opinion of the commission are necessary and proper for the exercise of the powers vested in it under this section, the provisions of section 11 of Act No. 176 of the Public Acts of 1939, as amended, being section 423.11 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, shall be applicable, except that subpoenas may issue as provided in section 11 without regard to whether mediation shall have been undertaken.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)   The labor relations and mediation functions of this act shall be separately administered by the commission.</DIV>
